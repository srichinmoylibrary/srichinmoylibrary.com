  <h2 id="page-title">The Little Girl&#039;s Gift To God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Little Girl&#039;s Gift To God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A little girl said to her mother, "Christmas is coming, Mother. Every year at Christmas time Santa Claus gives us so many gifts. Now please tell me, where does he get all his gifts for the children?"</p>
<p>The mother said, "Santa Claus gets them all from God."</p>
<p>The little girl said, "From God? Mother, that means we must also give something to God."</p>
<p>The mother replied, "God does not need anything."</p>
<p>"How can that be?" the girl asked. "God gives gifts to Santa Claus and Santa Claus gives us everything. But you have taught me that when we get something from someone, we should give something to them in return. Since God is giving us so much, we should give something to God."</p>
<p>The mother said, "What can we do? How can we give anything to God? We do not see Him. But God definitely gives everything to Santa Claus for the children."</p>
<p>"Mother, I have an idea! You told me that God is on the altar in the church. I want to go and give a present to God. I have only one dollar, and this dollar I want to give to God."</p>
<p>"Very good," replied her mother.</p>
<p>The daughter added, "I am going to the church now to put this dollar on the altar. I am sure God will come and take my money. Tomorrow morning I will check to see if He has taken my dollar."</p>
<p>The mother said, "Definitely! We do not see God, but He sees us. After you put your dollar on the altar, God will come and He will bless you secretly tonight with all His Love and Affection. Then God will take the dollar with Him."</p>
<p>The little girl put her dollar on the altar. The following morning, she went happily and eagerly to the church to see if God had taken her dollar.</p>
<p>The mother was so worried. "What shall I do?" She was praying to God, "Somebody has to take the money away. Otherwise my child will be unhappy and displeased, because she will think You are not accepting her money! She gets so many things from Santa Claus, and Santa Claus gets everything from You. She really wants You to accept her small love offering." The mother was extremely worried. She was praying and praying.</p>
<p>God answered the mother's prayers and came in the form of a priest. Earlier that morning, the priest saw the altar and was so surprised. He asked himself, "Who has placed a dollar here on the altar at this hour?" The priest took the dollar and put it in the church's love offering box.</p>
<p>The mother brought her daughter to church and the little girl started jumping with joy when she saw that God had come and taken away her dollar. The mother said to her daughter, "I told you! We do not see God, but He definitely listens to our prayers. You gave your dollar to God and He came and took it. God is very pleased with you and very proud of you."</p>
<p>Inwardly, the mother had been dying with worries and anxieties. But God did listen to her prayers. The child was so happy that God, Himself, came to take her gift.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Tie And The Handkerchief</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Tie And The Handkerchief" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a tie and a handkerchief were having an unfortunate dispute. Although the handkerchief did not want to argue, the tie did.</p>
<p>The tie told the handkerchief, "You are useless! You just hide in somebody's pocket, but I show the world how great I am. I make the person very great! I am so dignified, but you are only hiding! The whole world admires me, and you are so insignificant!"</p>
<p>The handkerchief said, "What you are saying makes me so sad. God made me humble. When people shed tears, I wipe them away. People need me and I am so happy to be of service to them. When people are sweating, they take me out of their pockets to wipe their brow. When they cough, they use me. Then again, when they are finished with me, they put me back. I want to be always a humble servitor."</p>
<p>The tie replied, "You are truly useless! Look at how people appreciate and admire me. As soon as someone wears me, I get the whole world's admiration. I cannot imagine how you can ever be happy."</p>
<p>The handkerchief replied, "I am serving in my own humble, modest way. Yes, I am very happy. If you are happy by drawing attention from the world, then please be happy in your way."</p>
<p>"I am telling you once again, you are worse than useless!" proclaimed the tie.</p>
<p>At that very moment God appeared before them. The tie started telling God, "How great I am! Everyone admires me."</p>
<p>The handkerchief said, "Lord, I am so grateful that you have allowed me to be of service by wiping people's tears, and helping them when they are sweating and coughing. You have given me this golden opportunity to serve You, my Lord. I am so grateful."</p>
<p>The tie was very proud! "I am so great! I draw the whole world's attention."</p>
<p>The tie added, "God, tell us! Who is more important — me or this utterly insignificant handkerchief?"</p>
<p>God said, "My son, my handkerchief is infinitely more important, because he is humble. I created the world for humble service. This is what my handkerchief is doing; whereas, you are not serving humanity. You are only showing off. In my judgement, a handkerchief is infinitely more important than a tie. I want everybody to serve My creation with utmost humility."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Doctor&#039;s Hopeful Assistants</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Doctor&#039;s Hopeful Assistants" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A doctor was looking for an assistant, and many people were coming to him to apply for the job. He asked each person, "What can you do?"</p>
<p>Then the doctor asked each person, "What is your goal?"</p>
<p>The first man said, "If I make money, I will get married and buy a big house for my family."</p>
<p>Another man answered, "My goal is to make lots of money and retire as soon as I can."</p>
<p>The third man said, "I want to save money, so that I can get married and spend lots of money on my wife to keep her always happy."</p>
<p>Each applicant said what he wanted to do and eventually become. The doctor was not at all pleased with any of the applicants. He said, "All right. I will call you if I need you." Then he sent them away.</p>
<p>One day a very young man came to the doctor. The doctor said to him, "What are you doing here? You are not mature enough to be my assistant. You are so young. What do you know about medicine?"</p>
<p>He said, "I know nothing."</p>
<p>"Then why are you looking for a job here?"</p>
<p>"I am looking for a job, because I need money badly. I hope that you will teach me, and that I will be able to please you. Then you will give me some money. That is all I need."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "Now tell me, what is your goal?"</p>
<p>He said, "My goal is like yours — exactly like yours."</p>
<p>"What? Your goal is like mine? You are such a young fellow! What kind of audacity is that?"</p>
<p>He said, "No, I am giving you my frank answer. You may not give me the job, but the truth is that your goal is my goal."</p>
<p>"All right! Tell me! What is our goal?"</p>
<p>"Above your door, you have written, 'Go forward.' My goal is also, 'Go forward. Go forward.' We have exactly the same goal."</p>
<p>The doctor was so pleased! He said, "I will take care of you and teach you everything. I will make you my assistant. I will give you everything. You are the only person who has the same goal as I do: 'Go forward.'" The doctor immediately gave the young man the job.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Rich Businessman Makes Everyone Happy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Rich Businessman Makes Everyone Happy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once there was a businessman who was extremely rich. In the evening of his life, when he was very old, he said, "I have so much money! I do not have any relatives. I have no children as I never married. The best thing is for me to give away my money in just the right way."</p>
<p>The man made an announcement stating, "Whoever can show me proof that he owes money to someone can come to me next Saturday. I will pay all of that person's debts. I do not want anybody to remain indebted to anyone else."</p>
<p>The following Saturday arrived. All day long, the businessman was waiting, but no one came. As the day was ending, the businessman said, "I am so surprised and so happy that nobody is in debt! I thought that so many people owed so much money that they could not pay. But today nobody has come."</p>
<p>Late in the evening, an old man came by to ask the businessman to pay his debts. The businessman asked, "Can you prove to me that you owe money?"</p>
<p>The old man replied, "Yes, definitely. A few months ago, I borrowed money from a friend of mine for my daughter's marriage. I can prove that I have taken a loan. Now I am very old. I do hope that, before I die, I will be able to keep my promise and repay my friend."</p>
<p>The businessman said, "Do not worry! I will give you the money. Please take from me the money that you owe. You are such an honest man! Your daughter is married and in the future she will have children. I am giving you extra money for your daughter and grandchildren. Please take the money from me now." The old man could not believe that such a kind-hearted man existed on earth! He thanked the businessman profusely. The old man got the money to pay back his loan, plus more money for his daughter and future grandchildren. He was very happy and grateful.</p>
<p>Next a young girl came to the businessman. She was crying and crying. He said, "My God! What has happened?"</p>
<p>She answered, "My father is in the hospital, and I had to borrow a very large sum of money for his treatment."</p>
<p>"Can you prove it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I can. Here are the loan papers that I signed. You can see that I have borrowed so much money. I do not know how I will be able to pay it back. You have said that you will give money to anybody who has taken a loan, but I do not know if it is really true."</p>
<p>The businessman said, "You do not have to worry! You have shown me that you owe money. I am giving you the money."</p>
<p>The girl was beaming with joy.</p>
<p>The businessman said, "Wait! Something else I want to tell you. Two things may happen. Your father is an old man. In the hospital, he may die, or else he will come back home. If he dies, you will need money for the funeral. If your father is cured and comes back home, you will have to take care of him. I am giving you more money. No matter what happens to your father, you will need this money."</p>
<p>The young girl was so deeply moved that she began shedding tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>The following day, many people heard about the good fortune of the old man and the young girl. Previously, nobody believed the businessman. When people came to know that he was keeping his promise, hundreds of people flocked to him.</p>
<p>The businessman said, "Before, you did not believe me. Now, after seeing what others received, you do believe me. I do not want to keep my promise to you people!"</p>
<p>A short while later, however, he changed his mind and said, "On second thought, human beings never trust other people. I will keep my promise."</p>
<p>The businessman gave money to each and every person who came. All the people were showing their papers and telling him their sad stories. To each he gave the money they needed, plus a little more. The people were so happy!</p>
<p>The businessman said, "I have made so many people happy, and I am getting so much joy from their happiness. Now I am renouncing the world. All these people depended on me, and I helped them. From now on, I shall depend only on God. I know that He will lovingly and perfectly fulfil all my needs, now and forever."</p>

<p>A nun came up to a priest and said, "Father, Father, I need your advice please. I have a question!"</p>
<p>The priest said most affectionately, "All right. Please ask me your question."</p>
<p>The nun asked, "Father, can a priest marry?"</p>
<p>The priest replied, "Why not?"</p>
<p>The nun was astonished. "How can a priest marry?"</p>
<p>"You see, I am a priest. To marry means what? When you love someone, you marry that person. I love myself. In fact, I love myself more than I love anybody else, so I am married to myself. Again, the real in me is Jesus Christ, so I am married to Him. Since I am married to myself and I am married to God, I am telling you that a priest can definitely marry!"</p>
<p>Then the priest asked the nun, "What about you? Do you want to get married?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, Father. You have taught me that I am already married to the Saviour Christ, so I do not want to get married again."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Paul Proposes And Linda Disposes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Paul Proposes And Linda Disposes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One night there was a wild party. Many young boys and girls had fun drinking and dancing. The following day one of the boys wrote:</p>
<p>Dear Linda,</p>
<p>Last night I proposed to you, but I cannot remember whether you said "yes" or "no."</p>
<p>Linda wrote back to the boy:</p>
<p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>I do not remember who proposed to me, but I do remember that I said "no."</p>
<p>In life, when we pray to God intensely, we always think that God will fulfil our desires. But we never think that the fulfilment of our desires can be disastrous. We pray to God for anything that we feel like having. But if we pray to God for our desire-fulfilment, it is best if we add, "God, if it is Your Will, please give me what I am praying for."</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, we always want to possess someone or something. The boy was in love, but the girl was not; she rejected him. In the case of spiritual people, when we pray to God for something, we have to know that if God does not fulfil our desires, it is for our own progress and for the betterment of our life. In the ordinary life, if a desire is not fulfilled, we feel doomed, because we feel our desire must be fulfilled in our own way. But, in the spiritual life, aspiration-fulfilment has to take place in God's own Way.</p>
<p>We are eager, eager, eager. In the ordinary life, if our desire is not fulfilled, we feel doomed. But in the spiritual life, if our desire is not fulfilled, we should have the kind of eagerness that says, "I am eager to have my desire fulfilled. I am dying to have it fulfilled. But please give me the capacity to accept Your Will in Your own Way so that I will have real joy."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Not For Ten Million Dollars</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Not For Ten Million Dollars" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a tourist was walking along the streets of Calcutta. The street he was walking on was dirty and filthy. The tourist saw a leper who was in severe pain. Because of the many infected sores all over his body, the leper had a putrid smell. A nun was dressing his wounds with utmost love and affection.</p>
<p>Disgusted, the tourist said to the nun, "Sister, I would not do this kind of thing even if someone gave me ten million dollars!"</p>
<p>The nun replied, "Yes, I believe you. You would not do this for ten million dollars. I also would not do this for ten million dollars. I am doing this only for a little Smile from my Beloved Lord Supreme."</p>

<p>Our human life is all uncertainty. Columbus did not know where he was going; when he landed, he did not know where he was. What is more, Columbus did not have his own capital; he did everything with borrowed money.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, when we start to aspire, we usually do not know where we are. We do not know where we are going. And when we reach a place, we again do not know where we have arrived.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will help us greatly in our spiritual life if we know a little more about our divine journey. We are starting our pilgrimage inside God's Heart. Then we are entering into God's Eye. From God's Eye, we are going into God's entire universe. After watching the universe and seeing God's entire creation, we are coming back again into His Eye. Finally, we are entering once again into His Heart, our only Home.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Tears Of The Sinner</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Tears Of The Sinner" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A spiritual man and his friend, plus an atheist and a sinner, were all in a boat on an excursion. All of a sudden, a terrible storm rose up from the ocean, and threatened to capsize the boat. The spiritual man folded his hands and started praying to God. His friend was watching him pray. The atheist, who did not believe in God, knelt down and started praying to God, most soulfully, to save their lives.</p>
<p>The spiritual man looked at the sinner and said to him, "Hide! Hide! If God sees you, He will be displeased with all of us, and He will allow the boat to sink. You must hide!"</p>
<p>The atheist, who was praying most soulfully, stopped and said, "No! No! God will come to save us <em>only</em> because of the sinner. I can see that the sinner's eyes are full of tears. But what are you doing? You are a spiritual man, true, but you are just showing off. You are praying to God, which you do every day. In your prayer, there is no sincerity, intensity or humility. Your friend is useless. He is just watching you and is not at all involved."</p>
<p>The atheist continued, "I myself do not believe in God. But at this moment, who can save me, if not God? God has entered into my life because I am afraid that I am going to die soon. True, the sinner has committed many, many sins. He has done many wrong things. But just look at him! I clearly see that with all his heart's tears, he is praying to God for forgiveness. If we are saved, it will be all because of his tears."</p>
<p>At that moment, the storm subsided and the boat started sailing smoothly once again. The tears of the sinner saved all their lives.</p>

<p>Three men died on the same day at the same time: the Pope, a cardinal and a politician. St. Peter showed the Pope and the cardinal a tiny, but cozy place. The politician got a very beautiful palace.</p>
<p>Most reverentially, the Pope and the cardinal asked St. Peter, "Can you please tell us how it is that the politician has such a big palace, full of comfort and light, while our little room is comfortable, but it is so small and dark. We have done so much for humanity; all along we have been praying and praying to the Saviour. Yet, this politician has told lies his entire life; he has never uttered even one truth!"</p>
<p>St. Peter said, "Look here! We have popes. We have cardinals. But we do not have politicians in Heaven. We need politicians badly. Indeed, he is our first politician; that is why we are giving him a palace. We have no need for more popes or cardinals. Heaven needs a few politicians, because we want to have all kinds of human beings here."</p>
<p>This means that Heaven is for all. Heaven is not only for popes and cardinals. The heart of Heaven is so large that it can easily accommodate everybody. This is the truth.</p>

<p>A Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi, a Protestant minister and a taxi driver all died on the same day at the same hour. They all went to the Gates of Heaven and saw St. Peter.</p>
<p>The three religious men said, "How can we be at the Gates of Heaven with this silly taxi driver? What has he done? We have prayed and we have done so many good things. We have consoled people. We have lifted the consciousness of countless people. How can this silly taxi driver possibly be with us?"</p>
<p>St. Peter said, "You have only talked about hell in your sermons. But you could never show what hell looks like. You told people that hell is so frightening, that it is such a dark place and all that. But while driving very fast, the taxi driver has shown hell to so many people. He has nearly taken away his passengers' lives. By terrifying people with his fast and careless driving, this taxi driver was able to give them the direct experience of hell. You people could only talk about hell. He actually took them there! To me he is superior. He rightly deserves to be in Heaven."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Alexander The Great And Alexander The Lazy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Alexander The Great And Alexander The Lazy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Alexander the Great had a soldier in his army who was unthinkably lazy. Everybody hated him because he was so dull, and he was always wasting time with his laziness. Unfortunately, he had the same name as Alexander the Great. Many people complained about him to the king.</p>
<p>One day the soldiers brought the lazy Alexander before their king. They said, "This man has the name <em>Alexander</em>. You are our beloved king; you are our supreme emperor. When we say your name, <em>Alexander,</em> we are filled with tremendous love, joy, respect and inspiration. But when we call him <em>Alexander,</em> all our joy and inspiration go away. Can you not get rid of him?"</p>
<p>Alexander the Great said, "Let me give him one more chance."</p>
<p>The king said to the man, "Either be active and dynamic, or I am taking away your name. You will have to find another name."</p>
<p>The man said, "Oh no, no! I cannot let this happen."</p>
<p>"I cannot allow you to have my name. In every way, you are such a lazy and useless fellow. From now on, you must immediately become active and dynamic," so said Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>To others' greatest surprise, the man immediately became full of life energy. His dynamism even surpassed that of all the other soldiers. They could not believe how enthusiastic and dynamic he became. This was all because Alexander the Great was about to take away his name.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, we want to be God's divinely chosen children. We must be very, very careful of the way in which we use God's Name. If we are not totally sincere, earnest and disciplined, then we are not worthy of repeating God's Name.</p>
<p>God will not tell us that He will take away our names, or even that He will not give us a human incarnation. God will only say, "I gave you a human incarnation to be My representative on earth. But you are only wasting your time."</p>
<p>Alexander the Great, being human, did not have the patience to see the perfection of the man. He used his impatience and his authority successfully. In God's case, He has infinite Patience. But just because God uses infinite Patience, we must not misuse His Compassion. We also should try to be worthy of God's Name, the way that particular soldier became so eager to be worthy of Alexander's name.</p>
<p>To be worthy of God's Love, Affection, Fondness, Compassion and Blessings, we must pray and meditate. We must love and serve God most intensely. Then we shall not lose our precious God-heritage.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Relaxation And The Ants</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Relaxation And The Ants" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A doctor said to his patient, "How am I going to cure you if you do not listen to me? You must not work so hard. I am asking you to relax and take some time off for vacation. Then only will I be able to cure you."</p>
<p>The patient said, "Nonsense! I am an important and very busy executive. I have no time! I am always busy."</p>
<p>The doctor replied, "You idiot! Have you ever seen an ant? Ants are always busy, busy. Is there any fleeting second when ants take rest? But again, ants enjoy picnics. Wherever there is a picnic, ants are always there! The ants work hard every day; but if there is a picnic, you will see that all the ants have come for relaxation."</p>
<p>We can learn from the ants that we have to work very hard in life. But again, relaxation is of paramount importance to inundate us with new freshness, new hope and new promise. Otherwise, if we work very, very hard day in and day out, there are many things that we will not accomplish. We must also take relaxation seriously. Even with a machine, if we use the machine continuously and do not allow the machine to rest for a couple of hours, then the machine will revolt and break down. The body is also a machine. If this machine does not get some rest after working vigorously for quite a few hours, then the body will collapse.</p>
<p>In every field of life, we shall do everything diligently for hours and hours. Then we need to rest and energise ourselves with new inspiration. Life needs both activity and rest. They both must go together hand in hand. Both hard work and relaxation are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>With one leg we cannot walk. Activity is one leg and rest is another leg. Relaxation does not mean the negation of work. Relaxation is absolutely needed when we have played our role in our multifarious activities.</p>
<p>Again, relaxation is totally different from luxury or pleasure. Often we do not work for even five minutes and we still want to enjoy pleasure. But after working for eight hours, the body does need a little rest. Relaxation is also a part of God's creation. Relaxation is complementary to our hard work; it fills us with a new hope and a new promise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Doctor&#039;s Loving Service</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Doctor&#039;s Loving Service" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a doctor who always treated the poor free of charge. He always went to their homes and offered them his heart's purest love, concern and care.</p>
<p>Once a rich man was sick and said to the doctor, "Please tell me, how much will it cost for you to take care of me? I will pay you $10,000 for the treatment."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "$10,000? I am not the right doctor for you. You can go to another doctor who will charge you $10,000. I am for the poor. I take care of poor patients, not rich patients."</p>
<p>The rich man said, "But I have heard that on rare occasions, when rich people are really suffering, you agree to treat them out of your compassion and concern."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is true. But I will not take any money from you! In that case, do you still want me to treat you?"</p>
<p>The rich man answered, "I am coming to your place for you to examine me."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "To my place? Whenever people are in trouble, I go to them. I do not want to compel you to come to my place just because you are in trouble. I do not want to show off. I will feel miserable if you come to me, because I will not be able to show you all my love and concern. I cannot assure you that I will be able to cure you, but I am coming to your place free of charge."</p>
<p>The doctor went to the rich man's house and cured him. He did not accept even a penny for treating the rich man.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Man With No Enemies</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Man With No Enemies" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a priest gave a wonderful sermon. Many, many people were in church to hear it. The priest said, "No matter how great you are and no matter how good you are, you will have enemies. In this world, there is not a single person who has no enemies." The priest added, "Some people have more enemies, while others have fewer enemies. But nobody can claim to have no enemies."</p>
<p>Everybody remained silent, because they felt it was absolutely true. Then one very old man stood up and said, "I have no enemies!"</p>
<p>Everybody began to criticise him. They said, "Do you have to tell such a lie even at your age?"</p>
<p>Even the priest started scolding the old man. "This is yet another sin you have committed! You have committed so many sins in this lifetime. By saying that you have no enemy, you have added yet one more sin at this ripe old age."</p>
<p>The old man said to the priest, "Father, how do you know that I am not telling you the truth?" He insisted, "I am telling the truth. I did have many, many enemies, but I have outlived all of them! They are all dead now. I have no enemies left."</p>
<p>Now everyone was silent. They all knew that the old man was telling the truth.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, we have many enemies. Jealousy, insecurity, insincerity and impurity are all our enemies. If we live on earth for many years, then we get the golden opportunity to pray and meditate in order to conquer all of these enemies. Again, old age is not a guarantee. Even if we live a long life, we need to also pray and meditate in order to conquer our undivine qualities in this lifetime. In this way, old age can be a very special opportunity and a veritable blessing.</p>
