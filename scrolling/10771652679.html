<p>The scientist-sage valued two things most ardently: simplicity and privacy. Simplicity expedites our heavenward journey; privacy is our refusal to squander our inner spontaneous faith. The world admired his simplicity-heart and his privacy-life. To quote Einstein: <em>“I don’t want anyone walking through my life.”</em></p>

<p>Death precedes birth, birth precedes death. Death is an undeniable fact. Death is also a mystery. The more we try to understand it with our human capacities, the more this mystery baffles us. To the weary souls who have fought sleeplessly against death, when finally it arrives it comes as a supreme relief. Once, in an interview with Albert Einstein, I. B. Cohen commented that “Death is both a fact and a mystery,” to which Einstein added, <em>“and a relief.”</em></p>

<p>When the final hour arrives, no one can deny its call. The oneness-heart of Einstein, which sailed with the Supreme Pilot, knew this. Therefore, he was dead against the use of any artificial treatment to prolong his life. Simple he was, natural he was, spontaneous he was. Any kind of artificiality was always foreign to him. His was a candid life-opening reality and truth-fulfilling divinity that pervaded the entire world. When Einstein was told that surgery might be able to cure his ailment, he only replied, <em>“I do not believe in artificially prolonging life.”</em></p>

<p>Einstein’s life was a song of simplicity from beginning to end. When the scientist died, very few people came to his funeral, even less than the number present at his birth. He had asked that he be cremated and that there be nothing to mark his passing. This last wish, too, was granted.</p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Each human being is a unique reality in himself and has a standard of his own. Although he is a part of an integral reality, it is wise to let him develop his own standard according to his inner receptivity and outer capacity. Standardisation will be a deplorable mistake. The unique individualist in Einstein illumines our minds: <em>“Standardisation robs life of its spice.”</em></p>
<p>The thinker in Einstein tells us something most significant: who is qualified and who is not qualified for life. The thinker-scientist, who is a staunch supporter of truth, awakens the human in us and fulfils the divine in us when he says: <em>“The man who regards life [...] as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost disqualified for life.”</em></p>

<p>To succeed in life, devotion is necessary and patience is necessary. Devotion has to be spontaneous. Patience has to be sleepless. There is no other way to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Greatness and devotedness perfectly rhyme. Patience is nothing short of strength; devotion is Eternity’s Length. Both devotion and patience are of supreme importance. Devotion wants to run fast, faster, fastest. Patience says to devotion, <em>“You run the fastest. I shall conquer all obstacles on the way for you.”</em> To quote Einstein: <em>“If one gets hold of something that will not let go its hold on him — in short, if one has the devotion for a great work — what more is necessary? Patience! Then a little more patience.”</em></p>

<p>What we need is a clear mind. What we need is a pure heart A mind of clarity and a heart of purity can alone give birth to courage. And what is courage? Courage is that which surmounts the torturing and destructive fear.</p>

<p>To avoid danger out of insecurity or fear is not the answer. As Einstein showed in his own life, danger should be avoided only because of a noble principle or a great realisation. Otherwise, one should give up thoughts of danger and insecurity-life, for a life of fear is the awakening of death-dragon. <em>“If a man constantly thinks of avoidance of danger, the result can only be insecurity and fear.”</em> Principle comes first and foremost. The pleasure of life, the satisfaction of life, the perfection of life can come later on.</p>

<p>Einstein saw divinity in all human beings, no matter how small their achievement on earth or how deplorable and meaningless their human life. Even when he had to face a volley of criticism, never did he give up this conviction.

<p>Belief is a blessing, Einstein realised. This supreme blessing expedites man’s inward, onward and upward journey. Each individual believes in something in a unique way, and achieves something that is also unique. What is his achievement? A feeling of oneness.</p>
<p>On being asked if there is anything in which a person can believe, the supreme lover in Einstein offered this special message to the world at large: <em>“I believe in the brotherhood of man, the uniqueness of the individual.”</em> When asked to prove his belief, Einstein declared, <em>“The mind can proceed only so far upon what it knows and can prove. There comes a point where the mind takes a leap — call it intuition or what you will — and comes out upon a higher plane of knowledge, but never can prove how it got there. All great discoveries have involved such a leap.”</em></p>

<p>The scientist-seeker knew that imagination is a reality. This reality is a world of its own. Slowly and steadily this reality enters into the human life to inspire the world with a new creation. Imagination is indeed the harbinger of a new creation. In Einstein’s words, <em>“Man’s conquest over his own ignorance must rest on intuition. It is imagination that makes man able to talk to the stars.”</em></p>
<p>We marvel at the transformation as the scientist-sage became the seeker-seer and offered the esoteric and Supreme truth in a visible and tangible manner. <em>“I claim credit for nothing. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player.”</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV: Science, religion and spirituality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV: Science, religion and spirituality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>What we have, we want to perfect. But we are not aware of where the goal is, what it looks like or what it stands for. We are not even aware that it exists. So naturally confusion assails us when we think of the goal. We try to perfect the tools that we are going to use, but what we are using them for, let alone what our cherished goal is, we do not know. Said Einstein, <em>“Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem to characterise our age.”</em></p>
<p>Science gives us the means; religion shows us the goal. In the scientist’s words: <em>“Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has nevertheless learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goal it has set up.”</em> So science and religion are interdependent.</p>
<p>Science sees; religion feels. Science says to religion: “I am seeing only to give you what I see.” Religion says to science: “I am feeling only to give you what I feel.” The benefit of science is recognised first in the mental world, then in the physical world. The benefit of religion is recognised first in the psychic world, then in the physical world.</p>
<p>Science says, “Truth-discovery is life-mastery.” Religion says, “Life-mastery is truth-discovery.” Science walks along the road that leads from perfection to satisfaction. Religion walks along the road that leads from satisfaction to perfection.</p>
<p>Inside the mind of science, God the creation looms large. Inside the heart of religion, God the Creator looms large. The mind of science smiles when it discovers the truth. The heart of religion cries when it discovers the truth. Science says to its discovery, <em>“I am happy because I have conquered you.”</em> Religion says to its discovery, <em>“I am happy because at long last you have conquered me.”</em></p>
<p>The scientist-sage in Einstein discovered the true truth: <em>“Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.”</em> He also revealed another truth: <em>“The cosmic religious experience is the strongest and noblest driving force behind scientific research.”</em></p>
<p>On another occasion he said, <em>“The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good as dead…It was the experience of mystery…that engendered religion.”</em></p>
<p>Material things could not please Einstein. Political things could not please him, either. The treasures of spirituality — life’s simplicity, the heart’s sincerity and the soul’s luminosity — in a special way pleased him. Him to quote: <em>“The basis of all scientific work is the conviction that the world is an ordered and comprehensive entity, which is a religious sentiment. My religious feeling is a humble amazement at the order revealed in the small patch of reality to which our feeble intelligence is equal.”</em></p>
<p>God’s ways are inscrutable. The human mind is baffled when it tries to measure God the unfathomable. But that does not mean that God gets malicious pleasure from this. No, the subtle God wants us to enjoy the subtle divinities and realities which are infinitely more beautiful more meaningful, more soulful and more fruitful than the outer divinities and realities. God feels that we too can enjoy the inner worlds most palpably and most convincingly by becoming subtle like God Himself. In a few prophetic words, Einstein teaches the world, <em>“The Lord God is subtle, but malicious He is not.”</em></p>
<p>Once Einstein wrote to a friend something about God-existence. What he said illumines those who love not only God the creation but also God the Universal Law, which houses perfect harmony disguised as seeming disorder: <em>“You believe in a God who plays at dice, whereas I believe in perfect laws in a world of existing things, in so far as they are real, which I try to understand with wild speculation.”</em></p>
<p>Each God-believer believes in God according to his inner capacities and outer confidence. Let us observe what kind of God Einstein believed in and revealed to the world at large: <em>“I believe in a God who reveals Himself in the harmony of all beings.”</em></p>
<p>The lover of life and the fulfiller of life in Einstein had no time to care for either the beginning or the end of life. Birth, death and life come from the same source, the perennial Source, the Abode of Immortality. Therefore, life could not puzzle him and death could not snatch him. <em>“I feel myself so much a part of all life that I am not in the least concerned with the beginning or the end of the concrete existence of any particular person in this unending stream,”</em> he said.</p>
<p>For the spiritual seeker, the fleeting moment is most important. A fleeting moment has the capacity to conquer Eternity’s Breath if the Supreme can utilise it in His own Way in and through a choice instrument of His. This is true for any field of human endeavour. Therefore, one should always try to be alert and conscious and aspire most soulfully in one’s own career, valuing not only the historical calendar but also the individual moment. In this way one can become a conscious instrument of the Supreme and turn one’s life into a supreme achievement of which both Heaven and earth can be proud.</p>
<p>No one is more aware of the supreme importance of the fleeting moment than the photographer. Einstein once commented that a photographer is like a surgeon. <em>“You have a life in your hands every time you use your camera and are photographing someone, because the picture you take today you may not get tomorrow, so you have to be very, very careful.”</em> Indeed, it may require only a few seconds to take a picture, but that photograph may be treasured by somebody for all his life.</p>
<p>In everything we do, there is the outer way and the inner way. The outer way is the way of possibility The inner way is the way of inevitability. The seeker brings to the fore the inevitabilities and manifests them in a solid and concrete manner. An ordinary individual, who is not a seeker, does not have a free access to the inner source. He usually turns possibility into inevitability by hard labour combined with Grace from above, of which he is totally unconscious.</p>
<p>It is our freedom of choice that helps us eventually improve both our outer and inner lives. The outer life tells us: “Become and give.” The inner life tells us: “Give. Give what you have and what you are. In the process of your self-giving, to your wide surprise you will see that you have become not only what you long for, but something infinitely more.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s observation on how freedom relates to spiritual development and the perfection of nature is at once inspiring and illumining: <em>“Only if outward and inner freedom are constantly and consciously pursued is there a possibility of spiritual development and perfection and thus of improving man’s outward and inner life.”</em></p>

<h2>O Human Rights</h2>


<p>O Human Rights Divine!<br /> In harmony-world you shine.<br /> You are the Voice of Light<br /> and blue Perfection-Height.<br /> Yours is the supreme role<br /> to change the cosmos-dole.<br /> You are the only strength<br /> of Heaven’s Vision-length.<br /> Division-bondage-doom<br /> no more —<br /> All oneness-bloom.</p>
<p><em> — Sri Chinmoy</em></p>

<p>Equality is of paramount importance. No equality, no peace of mind. No individual should become a victim to racial bias. There is no black or white. One soul, one goal, one Divinity and one Immortality shall always reign supreme over humanity’s devoted mind and surrendered heart. Einstein’s life knew it. Einstein’s heart felt it. Einstein’s soul was more than eager to share this sublime truth with humanity</p>
<p>In championing the cause of black people in America, Einstein was brave in action as well as in speech. Here the scientist became a fully devoted and dedicated God-server in man and man-lover in God. <em>“I believe that whoever tries to think things through honestly will soon recognise how unworthy and even fatal is the traditional bias against Negroes.... What can the man of good will do to combat this deeply rooted prejudice? He must have the courage to set an example by words and deeds, and must watch lest his children become influenced by racial bias.”</em></p>
<p>By serving humanity, one fulfils one’s true destiny. But he who expects a result from his actions is a veritable beggar. His is the heart that is wanting in magnanimity. His is the heart that is wanting in oneness with the Infinite. To quote Einstein: <em>“Why should one man receive a greater ‘reward’ for his work than another? And is it not a man’s duty to serve his fellow man without thinking in terms of reward?”</em></p>
<p>Science is indeed a great instrument, but if humanity or human realities are not given first and foremost importance, then no scientific data can ever elevate or illumine the earth-consciousness. Man’s fate man alone must change. Man’s face man alone must transform. There is no other way. Then, once it is done, man can invoke science to add more significance and more fruitfulness to humanity. Said Einstein, <em>“Of course, science is suffering from the terrible effects of the war, but it is humanity that should be given first consideration.”</em></p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Everything has its own origin. Einstein felt that the education-world begins with the mother. In an unmistakable manner he points out the responsibility of the mother and declares that the mother can offer something eternally fulfilling: peace. <em>“Education should begin in the cradle. Mothers throughout the world have the responsibility of sowing the seeds of peace into the souls of their children.”</em></p>
<p>Education means either to learn or to unlearn. Normally when we use the term “education,” we mean that we are going to learn something. But this is not always the case. Proper education offers both learning and unlearning. What we learn with the earth-bound mind is nothing more than limited knowledge. This knowledge is not and cannot be our eternal friend. It cannot help us all the time; it cannot save us from stark danger; it cannot illumine our deep-rooted subconscient and inconscient realities. Einstein’s comment on education is supremely illumining: <em>“Education is that which remains when one has forgotten everything he learned in school.”</em></p>
<p>It is not knowledge but wisdom that is our constant helper and constant saviour. This wisdom dawns when we surmount the barriers of the human mind. This wisdom dawns when we conquer mind-produced worry, anxiety, meanness and jealousy. This wisdom dawns only when we unlearn the unnecessary messages of the unhealthy, critical, cynical and strangling mind.</p>

<p>Einstein’s way of teaching was very special. Humour played a gigantic role at times in his approach. He taught his students not only how to think but also what to think of. <em>“Think more. Be totally absorbed. The answer is bound to dawn,”</em> was his philosophy. Memorisation, he felt, is not and cannot be the ultimate answer. He stressed this undeniable fact vehemently and unreservedly. Only today’s proper thinking will bring in tomorrow’s satisfaction-sun.</p>
