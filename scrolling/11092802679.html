  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you develop perfect gratitude?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you develop perfect gratitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, please try to feel that gratitude abides inside your heart. Then ask yourself whether you are the heart. The immediate answer will be, "One minute a day." The rest of the time, you are the mind or you are the body or you are the vital. But if you can feel that you are the heart, not just for a fleeting second or a fleeting minute, but twenty-four hours a day, if you can feel the presence of your heart as your own existence, then easily you will have gratitude, since gratitude lives inside the heart.</p>
<p>Now, how can you increase your gratitude? If you have that capacity to feel that you are the heart, try to feel that your heart is constantly becoming large, larger, largest. It is like the father whose salary is constantly increasing. He used to get fifty dollars a week, now he is getting one hundred dollars, and soon he will be getting two hundred dollars. In the same way, the capacity of your heart is constantly increasing. Now, the child of the heart is gratitude. When the father becomes richer, the child also automatically becomes richer because he knows that his father's property belongs to him as well. If his father becomes a multimillionaire, then in time his father's wealth goes to him. So when the heart is all the time expanding, when its capacity is all the time increasing, gratitude is also increasing and growing in capacity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can detachment help me become more and more perfect?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can detachment help me become more and more perfect?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know the difference between detachment and indifference. Very often these two words go together. But if you know the proper meaning of detachment and the proper meaning of indifference, then you can easily become more and more perfect. The real meaning of detachment is not rejection. Detachment means not approaching someone on the plane in which the situation is taking place.</p>
<p>Let us say something is happening between you and your mother. If you approach your mother on the same plane where her consciousness is or where your consciousness is, then you cannot throw any light on the situation. But if you are really detached at that time, you will enter into the Heart of the Supreme with her standard and with your own standard and refer the matter to the Supreme. You will say, "I am judging her on the strength of my own standard, and she is judging me on the strength of her own standard. So I am offering her standard to You, O Supreme, and I am offering my standard to You. Now You offer us Light and guidance. You throw Light on me and You throw Light on my mother. Let me not directly deal with my mother, and let her not directly deal with me. Only You deal with us." When you approach the Supreme in this way, it is called detachment. At that time, automatically you are becoming perfect in your outer life and in your inner life.</p>
<p>But if you cherish indifference towards your mother, or your mother cherishes indifference towards you, it will be a great, deplorable mistake. When you have a feeling of indifference, if the other person does something good, immediately you become jealous. Even though you say, "Who cares whether my mother does something well or not," if she does something well, you are bound to feel jealous. And although you say you have nothing to do with her, if she fails in something, you will be extremely happy. And the same will be true of her attitude to you.</p>
<p>Indifference is the wrong way to approach the truth. In indifference there is always a subtle jealousy; in indifference there is a sense of separativity. But when you use detachment, it means that you are already connected with someone. So let this connection be offered to the One who has the capacity to regulate and guide you. When you approach the Supreme on your own behalf and on behalf of the person from whom you want to be detached, then only do you make your life perfect. At that time, your life becomes a song of constant perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you identify yourself with the perfection of the Divine Mother? All the time, try to feel the Divine Mother within you, and try to please the Divine Mother within you. Try to fulfil the Divine Mother within you in your multifarious day-to-day activities, constantly, devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally. Then it is not only possible but inevitable for you to achieve the perfection of the Mother Divine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Although the soul's experience of perfection is an ever-transcending one, a man is bound to feel perfection in his own life because of his constant progress. As soon as he comes to a certain standard, as soon as he reaches a goal, he feels that he is perfect. Then, after some time, he feels that this is not enough for him; he wants to go to a higher goal. So his perfection becomes the starting point for another, higher goal. When he reaches his first destination, he is really satisfied. When I realised God, it was my first satisfaction, because it was my first goal. Then I tried to reveal God; that was my second goal. Now I am trying to manifest God; that is my third goal. There is no end to realisation. There is no end to revelation. There is no end to manifestation. But the moment we reach some standard, we are satisfied, and satisfaction, real satisfaction, is perfection. Satisfaction is very different from vital pleasure. In satisfaction we enter into the sea of Light and Delight. But again, we want to go to a higher goal, and achieve even greater satisfaction and perfection. So there is no end; God Himself is transcending and transcending.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can perfect our physical and vital stamina if we know that we are just a tiny well or pond and right ahead of us is a sea of Light and Delight. We are very tiny, very small, and all unlit, obscure, impure, imperfect. But right in front of us we see a sea of inexhaustible Energy, inexhaustible Light, everything that is endless.</p>
<p>Now what is the next thing to do? We just jump into this sea and claim it as our very own. Right now, imperfection and everything that we are, we claim as our very own. We are perfect strangers to perfection. Anything that is good is strange to us. Anything that is bad, we feel is ours; it is what we are. But that is a wrong idea. We have to feel that what we are right now is not the right thing, but what is in front of us is the right thing. That very thing we have to claim as our very own. And if we enter into it and become part and parcel of it, easily we can claim it. Automatically you can perfect your physical and vital stamina if you take this approach.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can become a perfect student in your inner and outer school if you feel that your inner and outer school are of utmost necessity at your present stage. The outer school is right now giving you the message of information: what the world looks like, what is happening in the world. The world of information is right now of paramount importance in your outer life. Then again, the inner world is also of paramount importance. The inner world is bringing you the message of illumination. From the outer life you are getting world-information, and from the inner life you are getting world-illumination. If right now you feel that it is necessary that these two should go together, it is like two friends walking along the same road. But a time comes when one friend becomes tired and says to the other, "I cannot go any farther. I am totally exhausted. Now I depend entirely on you. So please carry me on your shoulders." The information-friend becomes tired, and takes the help of the illumination-friend. So the illumination-friend says, "All right, you come with me; you stay inside me." In this way the illumination-friend carries the information-friend to the destined goal.</p>
<p>You have to have this kind of feeling: that you are cherishing inside yourself two friends, and because they are friends, and because they are needed right now for God's purpose, they will walk together. But a time will come when one will grow exhausted and take shelter in the other, in the one that can lead you to your ultimate destined goal. If you have this kind of awareness of the reality, then as a student you can be perfect in your inner and outer life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To offer ourselves as a perfect flower to God, first we have to become the flower itself. How do we become a flower? We become a flower through constant remembrance of what we are going to eventually be. We are going to be God's instrument. Now if we are an instrument, it means that we are not the doer; somebody else is the doer. We are not the creator; we are not the creation; we are not even the observer. We are only an experience that God is having. God is having an experience in us, with us and for us. When we feel that God is the Creator, the Experience and the Observer in us, that we are not doing anything and cannot do anything, but that it is He who is doing everything in and through and for us, at that time we become a perfect flower to be offered to the Supreme. When we feel that we are God's expanded reality and God is our expanded reality, then automatically we become a perfect flower to be placed at the Feet of the Lord Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! By chanting AUM, you can easily reveal inner and outer perfection, for AUM embodies the highest height and the deepest depth. AUM embodies Universal Consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness. AUM is the embodiment of God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. God as the highest Creator, the best Preserver and the most powerful Transformer of your ignorance-life, is within you.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please try to feel what the so-called gross body, physical body, has given you. immediately the answer will be frustration, depression and destruction. Depression is always followed by destruction. The body gives you this kind of thing just because the body can give you only what it has. You enter into a dark room and ask why there is only darkness. Just because you have entered into a dark room, naturally you will get darkness. Similarly, when your consciousness enters into the body, when you become one with your body-consciousness, naturally you become one with the gross physical needs of the body.</p>
<p>But if you enter into your heart, if you enter into your soul, then what happens? What the soul has to offer, what the soul embodies, you get. What the soul embodies is light. The heart also embodies light, although not to the same extent. So you have to enter into the soul or the heart and claim its light as your very own. Then you have to feel that you are the heart, that you are the soul. The next moment you look around and see if there is anything else that you would like to call your own. Then you see that your body is still in darkness and ignorance. At that time, with the soul's light or the heart's light you enter into the body and the vital. Then the physical pleasure and the lethargic ignorance-life of the body will automatically be transformed by the light of the soul and the heart. You have to know what you will claim first as your own. First you claim the soul and heart as your own, and then you deal with the transformation of the body's need. Otherwise, you will be putting the cart before the horse. If you enter into darkness first, before you have light, darkness will catch you and claim you. You wanted to possess darkness, but darkness has possessed you already. But if you claim the soul as your own first, then automatically the transformation of the body's need will take place.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the artist is a seeker, or the seeker is a divine artist, then only can this easily take place. As a matter of fact, a sincere artist, a divine artist, is a seeker. While a divine artist is creating something, his aspiration is going high, higher, highest. And then, if he is also a seeker, his very aspiration is creating something in the earth atmosphere. He is aspiring in his own room, but the fragrance of his aspiration, the power of his aspiration is spreading all around. So when the seeker and the artist become inseparably one in their aspiration and manifestation, then the perfection of art in human life is not only possible but inevitable.</p>
<p>The art that makes us universal is called perfection, and the aspiration that makes us universal is called supreme art. The secret of supreme art is its universal oneness, its universal consciousness. And again, real aspiration, aspiration of the heart, is also part and parcel of the universal consciousness. So artist and seeker, art and aspiration, are absolutely one. When one has that kind of awareness, when one discovers the truth in that way, then perfect perfection dawns in one's art-life and aspiration-life, which become inseparably one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Reaching inner perfection is like pressing down on a springboard. If you stand on a spring and press it down, the harder you press, the higher you will go. So in the spiritual life also, the deeper you go within, the deeper your focus of concentration, the higher the perfection you reach. When you go deep, deeper, deepest, you can feel you are reaching high, higher, highest. If you are sincere, if you are dedicated, if you are devoted, if you are soulful, if you are unconditional, at that time you will jump up like a spring to the highest when you go deep within. And then, when you arrive at the highest, do not keep your eyes shut, but try to see what is around you and below you. Then just spread your arms, and as soon as you spread your arms, you will see that the place you are covering is becoming all perfect. You are offering your benediction of light, and immediately your height and light are descending to the imperfect nature within you or around you.</p>
<p>So first dive deep within, and immediately you will be transported to the highest plane. Then just spread your arms and your consciousness, and come down. While you are descending, anything that is imperfect around you, before you and within you, becomes perfect. This is how you reach perfection and transmit your perfection to your outer life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I perfect my ability to surrender to the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I perfect my ability to surrender to the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can perfect your ability to surrender only by becoming wise. By not surrendering to the Will of the Supreme, what have you gained? Absolutely nothing! What have you lost? Absolutely everything! And what have you become? Nothing! So you have gained nothing and you have become nothing, and you have lost everything.</p>
<p>Let us say that wisdom has dawned upon you right now, and you want to gain something, you want to become something. What is it that you want to become? God's dearest, sweetest, fondest child! First you have to feel the need of something. Your need is to become God's dearest, sweetest, most intimate child. Then, in order to become what you want, you have to give what you have. God does not care whether it is bad or good; He only cares whether you are ready to give it to Him. What you have is a sea of ignorance. If you can give God your sea of ignorance, then naturally God will immediately give you what He has. God is a perfect gentleman, and He is not going to remain satisfied with your offering and not give you what He has. What He has is an infinite sea of Concern, Compassion, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>So you can perfect your ability to surrender just by becoming wise, just by knowing what you have and what you are, and what God has and what God is. God is so eager to give you what He has, but you are not so eager to give to Him. Again, His eagerness depends on your willingness to receive what He has; it depends on how soon you empty your vessel. This moment if you empty your vessel and let all the undivine rubbish go out of your nature, then immediately you will see and feel the purest Light and purest Delight. So by giving to God what you have, you will perfect your ability to surrender to His Will. At that time God will give you His own abilities and capacities, which are infinite.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, what directly interferes with our perfection?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, what directly interferes with our perfection?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our ego, our insecurity, our jealousy and our doubt! This moment we are in the doubt-world, this moment we are in the insecurity-world, this moment we are in the ego-world, this moment we are in the jealousy-world. If we feel that we belong only to the world of inseparable oneness, if we live only in the world of divine oneness, supreme oneness, we not only hear the song of perfection, but also sing the song of perfection; we not only watch the dance of perfection, but also dance the dance of perfection. So we have to know that we must not live in the world of fear, doubt and insecurity. These are the things that interfere with our perfection. But if we remain in the world of universal, divine oneness, then those undivine, negative forces cannot enter into us at all and cannot prevent us from making progress and becoming perfect.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does outer success ever help our inner perfection?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does outer success ever help our inner perfection?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know what actually happens as a result of the success. If outer success glorifies you, if it aggrandises and feeds your ego, if it gives you the feeling that everybody is touching your feet, and now you will be able to lord it over the world and dominate the world, then it cannot help in your perfection at all. It is useless. But if you take the experience as a rung of a ladder, and feel that there is again another rung and another; if you feel that there is no end to the rungs of the spiritual ladder, then naturally this success will help your inner perfection.</p>
<p>What you call success actually is an inner experience God is having in and through you. If you see outer success in this way, then you know that the experience is bound to help you in your inner, spiritual life, for God feels that from this experience He will be able to have inner perfection. But success which is a divine experience is not the kind of experience which makes you feel disproportionately great and superior to others. If you have that kind of feeling, then your outer success is a terrible failure and a great obstacle to your inner perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can perfect your cry for the Supreme if you feel that without the Supreme you are hopeless and useless, that without the Supreme you cannot exist even for a fleeting second. You can remain without food, without air, but not without God. If you have this feeling, you can easily perfect your cry for the Supreme.</p>
