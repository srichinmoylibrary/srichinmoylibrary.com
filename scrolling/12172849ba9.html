This creates fear in me, and I cannot meditate very well. How can I meditate without getting this feeling of oceans and water?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Please try to see the ocean as something of your own, something in your inner being. Instead of seeing the ocean with its surges and waves, please think of it as your own largest consciousness, and throw yourself into that largest and deepest consciousness. Unfortunately, your attitude towards the ocean has been wrong. There are so many seekers who try to imagine the ocean during their meditation so that they can make their consciousness as vast as the ocean. When you see this consciousness, you should feel happy and fortunate.</p>
<p>Do not focus your attention on the surface of the ocean, but please go, silently and consciously, deep into the ocean, where you will find your true reality, which is all tranquillity. Try to throw your own consciousness into the vastness of the ocean, and you will be able to meditate most powerfully and most successfully. You will be able to contact, deep within yourself, that which is nearest and dearest to your soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sir, when did you come upon the thought that there is an inner Self within yourself? And after you discovered that you had an inner Self, how did you make a connection with other people who were not aware that they had an inner Self?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sir, when did you come upon the thought that there is an inner Self within yourself? And after you discovered that you had an inner Self, how did you make a connection with other people who were not aware that they had an inner Self?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I have known intuitively, since my early childhood, that there is a deeper Self within me. Each one of us has an inner Self. Some are conscious of this inner Self and some are not. Those who are conscious of it are, according to us, spiritually developed. What they do in order to create a bridge between the outer world and the inner world, between the outer being and the inner being, is keep a burning flame of aspiration. This aspiration is based on self-sacrifice, outer and inner.</p>
<p>Suppose you have found your inner Self and inner life and discovered the solutions to your inner problems. But the person next door is utterly unconscious of the inner life and the inner world. Now it would be extremely difficult for you to have any kind of inner understanding with him. He cannot come and enter into your consciousness, for it is very difficult for an ordinary person to do this. But if you want to establish a bridge with him, what you can do during your meditation or concentration is this. First go deep within and bring forward all your sweet and subtle and harmonious feelings from within you. And then consciously, during your meditation, throw them into him: into his mind, into his body, into his heart. Then you have created a bridge between yourself and him.</p>
<p>Within your inner world you are secure. Your connection with the inner world has given you enormous confidence to cope with the outer world. Now you can go and speak to him about the spiritual life, the inner life, the life that gives you true happiness. He can then try it for himself.</p>
<p>So first within yourself, just like watering a plant every day, feed your inner being by meditation. Then come to the outer world with your creative manifestation to form a bridge between your inner achievements and the outer world, where your future fulfilment will take place.</p>

How can I determine which plane I belong to?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>You can know which plane you belong to by throwing your outer mind into the sea of your aspiring heart, whose source is Consciousness. This Consciousness is the life-breath of all planes. The awareness of this Consciousness permits you immediately to recognise your status — where you were, where you are now and how far you still have to go.</p>
<p>After becoming aware of which plane you belong to, try to carry out all your daily activities on that level. The easiest and most effective way of operating from that plane is to make your outer being a conscious and dedicated instrument of your inner vision and will.</p>
<p>In your case, let us suppose that you want to act from the intuitive mind. Once you have seen that plane and are conscious of it, you can try to remain there through your psychic aspiration and determined will. This is the real way to achieve mastery over a particular plane.</p>

<p>I will give you a very simple definition. Consciousness is the spark of life which connects each one of us with the Universal Life. It is the thread that puts us in tune with the universe. If you want to fly into the Transcendental, you need the thread of consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is a spark that lets us enter into the Light. It is our consciousness which connects us with God. It is the link between God and man, between Heaven and earth.</p>

<p>Don't think of doing anything. Just keep the door of your consciousness open, but see whether it is a thief or a friend who is coming in. Allow in only those whom you want. Keep out the lower thoughts. Open the door to higher, sublime thoughts. This is the first step in working on your consciousness. The following steps will come to you from within.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What is the meaning of AUM?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="What is the meaning of AUM?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>AUM is a Sanskrit word, a syllable. A Sanskrit word or a syllable has a special significance and a creative power. AUM is the Mother of all sounds. When we chant AUM, what actually happens is that we bring down Peace and Light from above and create a universal harmony within us and without us. When we repeat AUM, both our inner and our outer being become inspired and surcharged with a divine feeling and aspiration. AUM has no equal. AUM has infinite power. Just by repeating AUM, we can realise God.</p>
<p>When you chant AUM, try to feel that it is God who is climbing up and down within you. Hundreds of seekers in India have realised God simply by repeating AUM. AUM is the symbol of God, the Creator.</p>
<p>When you repeat AUM, please try to observe what actually happens. If you repeat the name of a cat, a dog or a monkey, or even of an ordinary person, you get no inspiration. But when you utter AUM, which is the symbol of the Creator, the life-breath of the Creator, you immediately get an inner feeling, a feeling that inspires your inner and outer movements to enlarge your vision and fulfil your life here on earth. This is the secret of AUM. If you want to cherish a secret all your life, then here is the secret. Soulfully chant AUM and everything is yours.</p>

<p>Everything has its own time. I have just told you about the significance of AUM, and the other day I told you about God. You have to know in which word you have more faith. When one person says God, all his love, faith and devotion come to the fore. In someone else, this may not be so. In your case, I told you to repeat the name of God, for you go to church and pray in the Christian way. In your culture, you are familiar with the term God.</p>
<p>In India, we repeat AUM or the name of a god or goddess, such as Shiva, Krishna or Kali. The most important thing is to know in whom or in which aspect of the Supreme you have absolute faith. When I told you about God, I had the feeling that all your life you had been trained to pray to God. But today AUM enters into you with its significance. One day I shall meditate with you and see whether God, AUM, Supreme, Infinite or some other aspect of the Absolute inspires you most. It is the inspiration that you get which is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>We have a physical body and a mind. Similarly, we can think of God as a physical being, having a mind like ours. People often imagine God as composed of a gigantic mind, or else functioning like them with the mind. Up until now, the mind has been humanity's greatest achievement. With the help of the mind, science and our physical world have progressed to an enormous extent. As the mind has been our highest attainment, we tend to think of God as a being with a most highly developed mind. But God is not a mental being. God does not act from the mind. He does not need the mental formulations which we utilise in order to act. God does not need to formulate ideas in a mental way.</p>
<p>Human beings usually think before they act. But in God's case, it is not like that. He uses His Willpower which, while seeing, also acts and becomes. God's seeing, acting and becoming are simultaneous and instantaneous.</p>

Is that really possible?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is quite possible. We think we must have a plan first so we can achieve success in the future by progressing and achieving according to our plan. Now we are labouring with our minds. The mind says, "I have to achieve something. I have to think about how I can execute my plan." But God does not do that. God sees the past, present and future at a glance. When we are one with God, when — by constant aspiration — we identify ourselves with God's Consciousness, then whatever we do will be done spontaneously. Then we will not utilise the mind, but always act from our own inner consciousness, with our intuitive faculty. And when we develop that intuitive faculty, we can easily act without having a plan.</p>
<p>At each moment, the possibility of the total manifestation that is going to take place will materialise right in front of us. Now we think that within, let us say, ten or twenty days some possibility may materialise concerning our hopes and aspirations. But when we are one with God's Consciousness, it is more than a possibility. It is an inevitability, an immediate achievement. The vision and the fulfilment go together. In the ordinary human consciousness, the vision is one thing and the fulfilment is something else. But when we are one with God's Consciousness, the vision and the fulfilment are inseparable.</p>

<p>Are you referring to yourself or are you speaking generally? If it is yourself, I can tell you easily. I know that in your meditation there are times when you go very deep, and your inner voice tells you, on the spur of the moment, that something has already been done. Your mind does not come and impose its ideas on that voice, saying, "If you do this, perhaps it will be a mistake; don't do that, or something may happen in the future; if you do it . . . and if you don't do it . . ." etc. The mind does not interfere. You can rest assured that when you get this kind of vision in your deep meditation, it is correct and it will spontaneously bring its own fulfilment.</p>

<p>You may call it either intuition or the direct perception of Truth, which needs no mental help. It is knowledge without thought or mental form. It is direct and spontaneous. It makes you feel what it is. Normally, you see something and then you give it a mental form, saying "This is what it is." But intuition simply makes you feel its true existence at once. Intuition houses the depth of Vision and the wealth of Realisation all together.</p>

<p>The mind is a link. Through the mind you can go to the regions far above the mind. But at the same time, through the mind, you can come to your vital being, your lower vital being. The mind is a channel that links us with what is above and what is below.</p>

<p>As you know, the study of semantics has gone into this problem very deeply. We know that it is not the actual word but the concept which we attach to the word that creates most of our difficulties. It is not the word itself that has an intrinsic value, but what concept the word conveys to us. But certain spiritual words are surcharged with a meaning or a condition or a consciousness that has developed in them from thousands of years of a special spiritual usage. When we enter deeply into the significance of such a word, and reveal its very breath and manifest its inner reality on the outer level, then the word fulfils its purpose, both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>The spiritual approach to the problem of words is that we have to go from the form to the Formless. We have to go through the finite to the Infinite. Indeed, this is the divine logic. Form at the beginning has a peerless value, but not necessarily at the end. For the beginner on the spiritual path, a form is absolutely necessary; the form is everything to him. So in the beginning we say that God has a form. But when the seeker goes deep within and sees that God is not a human being or a mental being but a vast infinite Consciousness, he goes beyond the form to the Formless, and can feel God as the infinite Consciousness. But again, God, being Infinite, can also be finite. Otherwise, He would not be Infinite. He is Omnipotent because He can live in the tiny atom and in the vast universe at the same time.</p>

<p>It is the same statement. <em>Atman</em> and <em>Paramatman</em> are the individual soul and the Supreme Self. God comes down into the manifestation and takes the form of the individual soul, <em>Atman</em>. Then the individual soul in the process of its evolution reaches and becomes the Supreme Self, <em>Paramatman</em>. To fulfil Himself integrally and wholly in the material world, God needs the individual soul.</p>
<p>The statements are the same. When Christ said, "I and my Father are one", it was like saying that <em>Atman</em> and <em>Paramatman</em> are one. That is why in India we say <em>Atmanam Viddhi</em>, "Know Thyself." If you know yourself, then you know God, because in essence there is no difference between you and God. Self-realisation is God-realisation and God-realisation is Self-realisation. For this reason in India we also say <em>Soham asmi</em>, "He am I", and <em>Aham Brahma</em>, "I am Brahman." In the same vein, all the esoteric traditions have always maintained that true knowledge is found by seeking within. This is why Jesus said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is within you."</p>
