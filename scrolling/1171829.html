SCS 1-7. This section consists of several lectures delivered by Sri Chinmoy in recent years.</p>
<h2>My Puerto Rico</h2>

<p>My geography tells me that you are the land of unmatched charm and beauty. My history tells me that you have significantly learned the meaning of suffering. My literature tells me that your culture is flooded with the soul's spontaneous sincerity.</p>
<p>My body tells me that your body is the perfect expression of nature's simplicity and candour. My mind tells me that your mind is looking pointedly into the golden vision of the future. My heart tells me that your heart is full of loving warmth and snow-white affection; and that your heart's tearing efforts to transcend the ill-fated barriers of poverty will, before long, be crowned with success.</p>
<p>Yesterday they came. Yesterday they conquered. Perhaps they helped. But they could have made better use of their paternal concern. Today they have come. Today they are helping. Momentous is their contribution. Yet you need more of their attention, sympathy and opportunity.</p>
<p>Let them come and let them go, if so is the Will of God. But you try to live dauntless, deep within. You try to listen to the dictates of your inner soul.</p>
<p>Yours is the mounting cry. Yours is the Golden Shore. Yours is the Promised Land. May God shower His choicest Blessings upon you, my Puerto Rico!</p>

<p>Mother Earth, Mother, we bow to you. We see you with our searching eyes. You see us, your children, with your glowing soul and flowing heart.</p>
<p>We love you with our heart's feeble capacity. You love us with your life's all-embracing reality.</p>
<p>Mother Earth, you are God's Sacrifice-tree. You are God's Realisation-flower. You are God's Perfection-fruit.</p>
<p>You are beauty's inspiration and duty's aspiration. You are inspiring God's entire creation to be beautiful, soulful and fruitful. You are aspiring in and through God's universe for God-satisfaction in God's own Way.</p>
<p>God blesses you constantly with His universal Delight and His transcendental Pride because you teach your children that transformation of human nature and not extinction of human nature is God's supreme choice.</p>
<p>God loves you most. Why? Because you love Him only. Because you suffer for Him only. Because you prosper for Him only. Because you have taught yourself that His choice is your choice, His voice is your voice. You have no choice of your own; you have no voice of your own. Your eternally and unconditionally surrendered oneness is your perfection-cry and God's Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
<p>You are at once God's Silence-creation and His Sound-creation. With your Sound-might you tell us, your children, how divinely great God is. With your Silence-height you tell us, your children, how supremely good God is. You also tell us that God's universal Greatness we eventually will become and that God's transcendental Goodness we sempiternally are.</p>
<p>Mother Earth, powerfully you concentrate, soulfully you meditate, fruitfully you contemplate. In your concentration we see God the infinitesimal atom. In your meditation we see God the ever-expanding Infinity. In your contemplation we see God the Beloved Supreme. In the inner world you are God's confidence in Himself. In the outer world you are God's assurance to Himself. God is your teacher. God is our teacher. He has taught you how to give to us unconditionally. He has taught us how to receive from you soulfully. The teacher says that you have done extremely well in the examination, while we have sadly failed. Therefore, Mother Earth, we congratulate you, we admire you, we adore you. Mother Earth, Mother, to you we bow and bow.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Patience</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Patience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is not a single human being on earth who does not need patience. And we who are seekers of infinite Light and Truth need patience more than others, for we are consciously, soulfully and devotedly aiming at the highest Goal. We want to climb up Mount Everest in the spiritual life. So naturally we need conscious, constant and unending patience. It is not like climbing up an ant-hill or even an ordinary hill; it cannot be done in the twinkling of an eye. The higher the goal, the more patience we need.</p>
<p>In our ordinary human life we have problems with our superiors, inferiors and equals. We have need of patience with our superiors when they exploit us and misuse our capacity and humility. We need to have patience with our inferiors when they mistrust our sincere appreciation and goodwill, or anything that we want to do for them. We have need of patience with our equals because there comes a time when they do not want to stay with us or live in and for us any more; but, at the same time, they want us to live only for them. They feel that they have to surpass us; that becomes their inner joy, that becomes their duty, while they feel that our duty is to remain where we are and please them in their own way. They want to surpass us and lord it over us just like our superiors.</p>
<p>We have need of patience with our human mothers, who tell us, "Don't go out, children. Stay inside. The outer world is dangerous; it is a devouring tiger. We don't want our children to be devoured by the world's cruelty, temptation and destruction. We want our children to stay at home cheerfully and peacefully with our constant affection, love and blessing."</p>
<p>We have need of patience with our human fathers who tell us, "Children, it is high time for you to go out of the house and walk around to see the world at large. It is time for you to receive from the outer world what it has to offer and to offer to the world what you have. The outer world needs your aspiration to fulfil itself, and you need the outer world's dedication to fulfil yourself. So don't stay inside any more. You are no longer a tiny plant but a strong tree. Go out and offer yourself to those who are in need of your guidance and protection."</p>
<p>We have need of patience with Heaven. Although Heaven will eventually grant us its infinite Peace, Light, Bliss and Power, unfortunately it delays at times in spite of our having the necessary receptivity. The only explanation we can find for this is that we are beggars. Heaven tells us that beggars cannot be choosers. Heaven will give according to its willingness. Therefore, we accept our deplorable fate.</p>
<p>A beggar cannot demand. But we know well that we shall not always remain beggars. We know well that when our full awakening takes place, we will see that we are none other than God's chosen instruments to fulfil Him here on earth. As spiritual seekers, we discover that our aspiration grows and glows; we realise that God wants only to please Himself and fulfil Himself in and through us. We feel that the best thing is to please God according to our awareness. Sooner or later we come to realise that it is not we who fulfil God but God who fulfils, satisfies and manifests in and through us.</p>
<p>We have need of patience with earth. Earth is constantly crying. It wants us to elevate its height to Heaven. We try to help earth in its upward movement since earth has a legitimate reason to ask us for a favour. Earth has blessed us with concern, oneness and sacrifice; naturally earth can make a request. But in spite of our best efforts we fail to elevate the earth-consciousness even an inch from where it is now. But this sad experience cannot last for good. One day our incapacity and inconscience will see that we are simply trying to please God, and there will come a time when all our inner failures will be transformed into success. On that day our name will be gratitude.</p>
<p>We have need of patience with God. At God's choice Hour, God will greet us and give us illumination-salvation, illumination-liberation. We try to expedite that choice Hour of God's, but God says, "Children, My decision has been made and will not change. I am not going to change the Hour." We cry and God tells us, "In your lamentation is sincerity. Cry more soulfully. Let Me see what I can do for you." But we feel the necessity of crying not only soulfully but also unconditionally. We wanted God to expedite His Hour, but we are now ready to wait for God's Hour. God says, "You have made considerable inner progress. I see you are ready. I have changed your Hour." When we are ready to wait for God's choice Hour unconditionally, God offers us His soulful Smile and sooner than at once He greets us with what He has and what He is. What He has is infinite Concern and Love for us and what He is is immortal Consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Desire-life and aspiration-life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Desire-life and aspiration-life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before the seeker entered into the spiritual life, he had a friend. His friend's name was desire. His friend said to him, "Life is pressure, life needs leisure. Creation is torture, creation needs pleasure. God is self-assertion, God needs Compassion."</p>
<p>The seeker is now in the spiritual life and he has a new friend. The name of his new friend is aspiration. This aspiration says to him, "Life is temptation, life needs illumination. Creation is imperfection, creation needs perfection. God is Eternity's salvation, God needs satisfaction here on earth, there in Heaven."</p>
<p>Before the seeker entered into the spiritual life, he used his love-power for world-possession, he used his devotion-power for world-recognition, he used his surrender-power for world-admiration. Now the seeker is in the spiritual life and he uses his love-power for self-expression, he uses his devotion-power for self-illumination, he uses his surrender-power for self-perfection.</p>
<p>Before the seeker entered into the spiritual life he thought that there was nothing in God's creation that he could not do, if he cared to. Anything he wanted to do or achieve, he felt that he could accomplish and achieve without fail. This was the dream-experience that he treasured and cherished in his everyday life. But reality had a different story to tell him. When he had to face reality, he saw, felt and learned that nothing — nothing at all — was within his easy reach. For every little thing he had to make a personal effort. He had to try and cry and cry and try; yet satisfaction always remained a far cry. In his dream-world he felt that he was the possessor of everything. In his reality-world he felt that he was the possessor of nothing. His dream-world made him feel that he was a prince. His reality-world made him see and feel that he was nothing short of a veritable beggar.</p>
<p>Now he is in the spiritual life and he feels that he can do nothing, for he himself is nothing. But to his wide surprise, when he dives deep within he sees that everything has already been done for him by his Inner Pilot, his Beloved Supreme. On the one hand, if he is asked to do something for himself or for the world at large, he feels he will fail. But when he realises his inseparable oneness with his Inner Pilot, he sees that everything is done for him by his Beloved Supreme, the infinite Absolute, and not only for him, but for everybody, for the entire creation. When the Creator created the creation with His Silence-Light, He Himself came into His creation as revealing and manifesting capacity.</p>
<p>Before he entered into the spiritual life, the seeker quite often, if not always, felt that he was an object of pity. The world pitied him because he was not contributing something substantial to the world. Humiliation was his lot. Now the seeker is in the spiritual life and he sees that, unfortunately, he has two more names which have been thrust upon him by the world-community: doubt and suspicion. His aspiration is doubted, his aspiration is suspected. Until the Goal is won by him, the world is bound to doubt him and suspect him. And even when he has reached the Goal, world-ignorance may not recognise him, not to speak of acclaiming him. His God-realisation is no guarantee of world-acceptance. His God-revelation is no guarantee for world-acceptance. But his God-manifestation is undoubtedly a guarantee of world-acceptance. For when he manifests God in and through himself, or when he manifests God in the world-body, or when he manifests God in the universal life, then the atheists, the agnostics and the lovers of God all see and feel that some illumination has taken place in their own lives. This illumination they observe according to the power of their own receptivity. Here at this point, the seeker is not an object of doubt and suspicion; he becomes the world friend, world comrade, world leader, world guide, world dreamer and world saviour. At that time the seeker is known as humanity's most precious cry and Divinity's most gracious Smile.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I maintain my inner strength during my meditation?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I maintain my inner strength during my meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here the strength is aspiration. During meditation, how can you develop more aspiration in order to go deeper. When you meditate, please do not think of diving deeper. If the mind operates, then you will not be able to go deeper at all. When you feel that you are in a sublime meditation, you will see that the meditation itself has its own power. So you only have to try to surrender to the meditative power within you. At that time do not use your mind. If you are having a profound meditation, then there cannot be any intervention of the mind. The meditation that you are having is the result of the meditative power within you. Just allow this meditative power to play its role. This meditative power will always have a free access to the deeper reality within you. Let it dive deep within if such is the Will of God. But sometimes the meditative power does not enter into the inner or deeper reality because it feels that the entire being is not fully ready. If it enters into the inner reality, there may be a revolt from the outer being. So when you enter into deep meditation, let the force that has already created this sublime meditation flow or grow inside you according to the Will of the Supreme. At that time do not bring your mind forward in order to go deeper or higher. The force that has already shown you its capacity can easily carry you into the deeper parts of your being, but it waits for God's Command or the Command of the Inner Pilot,</p>
<p>When you start meditation, the only thing you do is to make your mind calm and quiet, and then let the meditation do anything it wants to do. You do not act like a doer any more; your responsibility is over. When you have made your mind calm and quiet, your responsibility is totally over. Then you have to let the force, the divine force that is giving you the experience of a good meditation, do whatever else it wants to do in you and for you.</p>

<p>Consciousness is the connection between human aspiration and divine Compassion. Consciousness is at once man the preparation and God the ever-transcending Perfection. Man is the eternal preparation. God is the eternal Perfection.</p>
<p>Let us be conscious. To be conscious is not to become great in the desire-world. To be conscious is to be good in the aspiration-world. A conscious individual is he who inspires the world. A divinely conscious individual is he who aspires for the world, for the world's success and the world's progress. An eternally conscious individual is he who loves, serves, saves and liberates the world. A loving consciousness knows no forgetfulness, no procrastination, no destruction. An aspiring consciousness is a perfect stranger to tardiness, illusion, delusion and ingratitude.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, to be conscious means you are striving, searching and longing for something. You are consciously crying to accept the Command of the Inner Pilot and become His chosen instrument to please and fulfil Him in His own Way. You are not escaping from the world but you are accepting the world with all its teeming ignorance with a view towards ultimately transforming it.</p>
<p>When you are conscious, blinding doubt surrenders to the aspiring heart in you. It also means that fear surrenders to you, the fear which has prevented you from giving up your little 'I'. When you are conscious, you realise that you need total oneness in both the inner world and the outer world. You feel that satisfaction comes not from the ego's supremacy and autocracy but from your loving and serving oneness with man.</p>
<p>Consciousness is the seed in our life's multifarious activities. We are all the silence-seed and the sound-fruit. The silence-seed was God, is God and shall be God in His Vision-Life. The sound-fruit was, is and shall remain God in His Reality-Life.</p>
<p>Consciousness energises the eternal traveller in us and expedites our divine journey. Human consciousness is the boat. Divine consciousness is the passenger. Supreme Consciousness is the Boatman, the Consciousness of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>

<h2>Question: Could you say a few words on your purpose in coming to the West?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In 1964 I came to the West to be of service to the Supreme in the aspiring mankind. To be absolutely true and honest, the Supreme in me, who is my Inner Pilot, commanded me to come to the West and serve Him in the West.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Thank you very much. There seems to be a growing number of young people in the West who are interested in spirituality. Could you comment on that — if you see any reason for that or any future to it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Thank you very much. There seems to be a growing number of young people in the West who are interested in spirituality. Could you comment on that — if you see any reason for that or any future to it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the West people are very interested in the spiritual life and yoga. Especially the young generation is deeply interested in yoga. As we all know, yoga is conscious oneness with God. In order to establish this conscious oneness with God, we need to love from within, love from without. Young people today are crying for love. The love that binds is not the love that they are seeking. The love that expands, the love that emancipates, the love that makes them feel that they are of one and, at the same time, of many — this is the love that young people are seeking. Young men and young women have taken to the spiritual life precisely because they have felt an inner hunger for the divine love. I beg to be excused, but perhaps this love they did not get from their families or from their individual churches. If they had discovered or found this love in their parents, in their religious leaders, in their churches, then they would not have had to look for it in the Eastern approach.</p>
<p>The spiritual life is not the sole monopoly of India. Spirituality is for everyone. But there are different approaches. A Westerner is bound to have one approach to Reality; an Easterner will have another approach to Reality. But the Goal is the same. The Western approach is the approach of prayer, mostly of prayer. The Eastern approach, or Indian approach, let us say, is the approach of meditation. In yoga we try to synthesise the two approaches: prayer and meditation. We feel that one <em>can</em> realise God only through meditation, but again, if we know how to synthesise prayer and meditation, then we can expedite our spiritual journey. When we pray with folded hands, we feel that we are speaking to our Almighty Father and that He is listening to us. And when we meditate, we feel that He is talking to us and we are listening to Him. It is like the conversation we are having right now. You are asking me something and I am listening. Then it goes the other way. When we pray, we reach high, higher, highest. And when we meditate, we bring down into our system Peace, Light and Bliss from above. Seekers in the young generation want to speak to God and also they want to hear God's Voice. Only if we pray can we go up, up, up and tell God what we have to say. And when we meditate we also hear what our Lord has to tell <em>us</em>. So the seekers feel the need of both approaches; that is why they are inclined to follow the path of yoga.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why at this period in history is the West, which has been developing materialistically, now beginning to develop spiritually?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why at this period in history is the West, which has been developing materialistically, now beginning to develop spiritually?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now that the West has reached the pinnacle of material prosperity, the West feels in the inner world that it is totally bankrupt. In this world everybody wants satisfaction. A poor man wants satisfaction, a multimillionaire wants satisfaction. But a multimillionaire may come to realise that no matter how much money he has, even if he wallows in the pleasures of wealth, he may not or, let us say, he cannot get even an iota of real satisfaction. That is because satisfaction is an inner awakening, an inner achievement, an inner realisation. The West has been blessed by material wealth, material gifts; but what the West has is not enough to make it happy. So now the West wants to be blessed by inner wealth, which is satisfaction. The West feels that if it dives deep within and listens to the dictates of its inner being, the Inner Pilot, then inner satisfaction is bound to loom large. The message of matter the West has always listened to and fulfilled. But now it wants to listen to and fulfil the message of spirit. Not only is material perfection needed, but the perfection of the spirit is also needed.</p>
<p>It is like having two friends. I have listened to one friend all the time and now I feel I have to pay some attention to the other friend. Matter is not to be neglected; it is also God's creation. But if we listen to the dictates of the spirit, then only can material wealth be used for the right cause, for a divine purpose. Let us say matter is the body and spirit is our inner existence. If there is no body, how can we manifest? The soul is within us, but in order to manifest its divinity, the soul needs the body. And again, the body needs the soul in order to realise the highest, the Absolute. If there is no deity inside the body, then the body is of no use. Again, how can a deity remain in the street? It has to have a home.</p>
<p>What the West is doing now is diving deep within in order to become the life of silence. Once it has become the life of silence, then it can become the life of sound, expression, revelation. At this stage, the West feels that realisation is of paramount importance. And once realisation has taken place, then this truth can easily be offered to mankind. So the West is entering into the inner world in order to bring to the fore the wealth of the inner world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you say something about your activities at the U.N.?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you say something about your activities at the U.N.?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the United Nations there are many nations united together. The United Nations is like a lotus that has many petals. Each petal is necessary in order to form the lotus. Each nation has something to offer to the world at large. Twice a week we offer our devoted and dedicated service to the soul and the body of the U.N. We go there to invoke the presence of the soul of the U.N. We try to elevate the consciousness of the delegates, representatives and members of the staff. The delegates and representatives are trying to bring to the fore the good qualities of each nation in a political way. They want to bring about Peace, Light and Bliss in infinite measure so that the world will not surrender to war, but to love. Through our prayer and meditation we are trying to do the same thing, so that the world will not surrender to war, but to love. Through our prayer and meditation we are trying to do the same thing, but our approach is the inner approach. We are not saying that our approach is better. Far from it. But we feel that if we sow the seed, then it will eventually become a tiny plant, and finally it will grow into a banyan tree and produce flowers and fruits. This is our way. We feel that the seed has just germinated. They feel that the tree is already there, that the flowers and fruits are there, and that it is up to the world to accept the fruits, to eat the fruits and become energetic and dynamic.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is growing like anything. Previously it was like a hard rock, but now we feel that it is like fertile soil. It is responding. It is not only because we are praying and meditating, but because the U.N. members also have an inner urge to do the right thing, to grow into the divine light. It works in two ways. We will never say that we are working very hard and that is why we are getting the benefit. No. I have taken one step ahead and you have also taken one step ahead. So we are coming to a meeting point. The inner world is coming forward with its inner wealth and the outer world is then entering into the inner world with its aspiration. So they are meeting together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The U.N. authorities were kind enough to give me the opportunity to be of service. That was in 1970. Since then, it has been extremely easy for us to be of real service. Also, the late Secretary-General, U Thant, was extremely nice and kind to us. He showered his goodwill, affection, love and admiration on us for our selfless service. I had the golden opportunity to meet with him on a few occasions. He came to one of our functions and he encouraged our activities right from the beginning. He observed our activities and he was extremely nice, sympathetic, kind and appreciative of our spiritual activities at the U.N. I have dedicated a copy of one of these magazines, <em>Meditation at the United Nations</em>, to the late Secretary-General. There are many dignitaries who offered their soulful tributes to him in this magazine. I will send you a copy. Pope Paul has also been very nice to us. He deeply appreciates our activities at the United Nations. I have had the occasion to have a private audience with him twice, so he knows all about our activities at the United Nations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Speaking from the spiritual point of view, I wish to say there will always be some problem, either a food problem or physical problems, mental problems, vital problems, psychic problems. There will be no end to our problems. What we have to do is go to the root of all these problems. The root is ignorance. If I am making a mistake, then I have to rectify it all at once. If you are making a mistake, then it is your bounden duty to rectify it. If I know that I have done something or I am doing something wrong, then my inner awakening will prevent me from doing that thing. So it is not a matter of too little meat or too little grain. The real problem is ignorance. There are many things we do wrong every day; we can't help ourselves. We have surrendered to ignorance. That is why problems are in our mind, problems are in our body, problems are in our vital. Problems are everywhere. These problems can be solved only when we can surrender to the light, the inner divinity within us.</p>
