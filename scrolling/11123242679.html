<p><em>(Woodrow Wilson in his White House Office.)</em></p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Alas, a world war has begun with all its atrocities. I want my country to stay out of the war. To me, war is undivine and inhuman; therefore, it is beneath my dignity to fight. I have urged my nation not to enter into the vortex of war. We have had enough of war. What we need and what we shall always need is peace. <em>(He glances at the morning news and is horrified.)</em> I can't believe my eyes! German submarines have sunk our ships! I wanted to remain out of the war. Now I see that this can never be. Fight we must to defend our country. But I shall tell my country and the world that, for America, this will be a war to end all war.</p>

<p><em>(Woodrow Wilson and his daughter Margaret, at home.)</em></p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, God gave you a very big heart. Your heart cried for world peace. You did not want America to enter into the war, but Germany and circumstances compelled America to become involved. You told the world that, on our part, this was a war to end all war, and you fulfilled your promise. Now, again, you want to manifest your lifelong resolve. You want to avert all future wars. You want peace all over the world; therefore, you are sacrificing your very life-blood to form the League of Nations. You are facing tremendous opposition. To my utter sorrow, you are encountering the worst opposition from your own countrymen. But I feel from deep within that soon you will definitely be able to form the League of Nations. Your divine vision will see the face of supreme reality.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Margaret, my daughter, you have always been my confidante. Today your heart of illumination has consoled me tremendously.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, it is a great pleasure, a great joy and a great honour to be of help to you.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> Daughter, ideas live; men die.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Men like you with lofty ideas, never die. Because of their divine ideas, they remain immortal on earth. They are treasured equally by both Heaven and earth. Father, the League of Nations must see the light of day before you leave this body.</p>
<p><em>Woodrow Wilson:</em> How I wish it could be possible! Margaret, right from your childhood you were God-oriented. Now you have decided to go to India and practise spirituality. It is only in the spiritual life, you realise, that God-realisation is possible. I admire your genuine longing for God and bless your devoted heart. But I have one request to make of you. Please tell me that you will fulfil my request, my heart's desire. You will go to India only after I have gone to the other world, not before.</p>
<p><em>Margaret Wilson:</em> Father, I promise that I shall stay beside you like your most faithful shadow until you join the other world. Only then shall I go to India, the land of my heart's dream, the land of my soul's real reality-existence.</p>

<p><em>(Franklin D. Roosevelt is sitting at his desk.)</em></p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Lord, I am grateful to You for granting me the capacity to serve my country as its President. True, I am paralysed by polio, but You have blessed me with ceaseless activity. You have spoken through me these celestial words: "This great nation will revive... The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." And the most important of all the blessings that You have showered upon me is my dear wife, Eleanor. Without her I could have done nothing. Without her I could have become nothing. <em>(Eleanor Roosevelt enters.)</em></p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Franklin, I overheard you. Now it is my turn to speak. Because of you, I am the wife of our President. Because of you, I am the First Lady of the country.</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> And because of you, one day when I am physically gone, I will be known as the husband of the First Lady of the world.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Why? Why such extravagant absurdities?</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> No extravagant absurdities. Because of your devoted, selfless service to the nation and the world community, you deserve that greatest honour. I clearly see it. When the world claims you as its First Lady, an unprecedented honour, I shall swim in the sea of light and delight in Heaven.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> You have always been a great patriot. Now you are a matchless President. But since when have you become a prophet?</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Right from today. My vision can never fail.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> I also have a vision. Your dream of the United Nations will, without fail, blossom. Wilson's dream-the League of Nations-will be blossoming powerfully and significantly with a wider, brighter and more fulfilling capacity in your dream of the United Nations. Wilson entered into a war to end war. You, too, did the same after America was attacked. Both you and Wilson are God's sons of all-loving and all-fulfilling peace. Your dream will one day be fulfilled, I assure you.</p>
<p><em>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</em> Let us thank God that He has blessed both of us with prophetic vision.</p>
<p><em>Eleanor Roosevelt:</em> Indeed, you are a great prophet, Franklin.</p>
<p><em>Frank</em>in D. Roosevelt:/ And you are a prophetess, Eleanor.</p>

<p><em>(The White House. Harry Truman is working in his office.)</em></p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Japan, I warned you. You paid no heed to my warning. You are planning to bother us more and more. We simply can't tolerate you any more. Your cruelties and atrocities will remain unparalleled in world-history. But tomorrow — not even one day more shall pass — I shall end this war. Your Hiroshima and Nagasaki will be totally destroyed by our world-shattering and world-destroying atom bomb, and you will then be compelled to surrender. We want peace. Once victory is won, we shall again work for peace. Be with us and work for world peace if you want to save your face from the infamy of a world war caused and declared by you.</p>

<p><em>(The White House. Truman and one of his advisors.)</em></p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> So, Mr. President, you have won the election. We all are extremely proud that you have become our President for a second term. We were afraid that you would not win the second election, but you did. All glory to you, Mr. President.</p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Not in vain did I travel thirty thousand miles. Not in vain did I give three hundred fifty speeches. I have won. That means my Fair Deal has won. Our country, which basically wants and needs the Fair Deal, has won.</p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> Mr. President, Theodore Roosevelt is immortal for offering his "Square Deal" gift to the nation. Franklin Roosevelt is immortal for offering his "New Deal" gift to the nation and you will be immortal for offering your "Fair Deal" gift to the nation.</p>
<p><em>Harry Truman:</em> Whether or not I am going to be immortal I leave in the Hands of God. That is His business. My business is to become honest. My business is to see that my countrymen lead an honest life. Many businessmen stood against me when I proclaimed the Fair Deal. They were afraid that they were going to lose their businesses. What could I do? I was helpless. My sole purpose is to see the truth and serve the truth. Talking about businesses and businessmen, once upon a time I, too, was a businessman. I ran a clothing store, and I sadly failed. But this time, not in the capacity of a businessman but in the capacity of a truth-lover, and for the purpose of promoting the supreme necessity of truth in the minds and hearts of my countrymen, I am sure I shall succeed.</p>
<p><em>Advisor:</em> Mr. President, you must and you shall.</p>

<p><em>(New Delhi, India. Dwight D. Eisenhower is on a goodwill tour all around Asia. At night he has a dream in which the soul of India appears.)</em></p>
<p><em>Soul of India:</em> President Eisenhower, you are great. You were a five-star general. You are great. You have won the world war. You are great, you are greater and you are greatest because you want peace. I am the soul of India. I want peace too, peace all over the world. India has many faults, but India's true love for peace nullifies all her shortcomings. My son Krishna wanted peace between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. But when he saw that peace was not going to take birth in a divine way, he agreed to settle the issue through war. He advised the Pandavas to fight for the right cause. On being attacked, your country had to fight in World War I and World War II to defend herself and thus establish and maintain the Kingdom of Truth and World Peace. Your country's vision and my country's vision run parallel. Although at times your America and my India are at odds, they basically love each other, for both have the self-same goal: a peaceful life. My son Gandhi cried and cried for peace. Almost all of your predecessors also cried for peace. The whole world is so proud of Washington, the Father of your nation. He wanted nothing but peace. From him, all of you have imbibed the message of peace. Eisenhower, you and your country want peace. My children and I want peace. Therefore, we are one. In your first inaugural address, your prayer to God was pure and sublime. You said, "Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race, or calling." In your second inaugural address, you said something divine and supreme. You said, "This is our home, yet this is not the whole of our world. For our world is where our full destiny lies — with men, of all peoples and all nations, who are or would be free. And so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers, to the wide world of our duty and our destiny. May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly — until at last the darkness is no more."</p>
<p><em>Dwight D. Eisenhower:</em> O Soul of Mother India, you have an astonishing memory. I fully agree with you about India and America. I feel that India has the God ordained vision and America has the God-ordained mission. Both vision and mission must be united to give birth to humanity's perfection in life. You are so right. You are so right. <em>(Eisenhower sings "O Sweet Liberty".)</em></p>

And if renunciation is God-ordained, then it is perfect happiness. It was God who wanted you to renounce your possession-authority. Look, now your daughter America is happy and you are happy. Needless to say, I am happy too.</p>
<p><em>Soul of England:</em> Mother, once I was temptation-possession, but now I am illumination-oneness. And I unmistakably and gratefully know that it was all your doing.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> My daughter, what we need to know is not so much whose doing it was, but whether the thing is done. I am glad beyond measure that the thing is done, the right thing is done.</p>
<p><em>Soul of America:</em> Grandmother, Mother has taught me many nice things, and two things I treasure most: her mind's lofty nobility and her life's non-sentimental, or non-emotional but measured and confident progress along the road of Eternity's perfection.</p>
<p><em>World-soul:</em> You are absolutely right, my granddaughter. Now I would like both you and your mother to do me a big favour. Please sing me the song that says, "My Captain says go on."</p>
<p><em>(The souls of England and America sing:</em></p>

<p>There was a time when I stumbled and stumbled,<br /> But now I only climb and climb beyond<br /> And far beyond my Goal's endless Beyond,<br /> And yet my Captain commands: "Go on, go on!"</p>
