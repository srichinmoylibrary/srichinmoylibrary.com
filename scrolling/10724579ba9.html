<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can remain on God’s Path without getting lost if our cry remains sincere and genuine. If a child cries on the first floor and the mother happens to be on the third floor, the mother comes down to the child because she knows that the cry of the child is intense, sincere and genuine. Similarly, when our inner cry is sincere and genuine, God feeds us with His Compassion-Light. Once we are fed by His Compassion-Light, without the least possible hesitation we can walk along God’s Sunlit Path.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>jnana</em> is knowledge and <em>Vijnana</em> is superknowledge. <em>jnana</em>, or earthly knowledge, is all information. <em>Vijnana</em> has two meanings: one is “science,” the other is “Supreme discovery.” <em>Vijnana</em> is infinitely superior to the so-called mental knowledge, or what we call book-learning or world-information. It is a superior type of knowledge, which is founded upon one’s inner discovery. The inferior type of knowledge is <em>jnana</em>, which is desire-bound and earth-bound. <em>Vijnana</em> is Heaven-free. It is not bound by time or space. Anything that inspires us to become universal, to grow into the transcendental reality, is <em>Vijnana</em>. Anything that instigates us to bind the world is <em>jnana</em>. The higher knowledge inspires us to swim across the sea of light and delight, to fly in the vast welkin of peace, light and delight. The lesser knowledge instigates us to bind anything that we see around us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. It depends entirely on what kind of belief the seeker is dealing with. If it is only a mental belief, not based on inner reality, then naturally it will obscure his inner vision. But if it is something from the heart, from the psychic vision or reality, then it will without fail accelerate his progress. If it is mere mental belief which comes from the earthbound mind, it is bound to be contradicted by another type of belief. But if our belief has grown into positive conviction, soulful conviction, then it will not be an obstacle. On the contrary, our soulful conviction expedites our life’s spiritual Journey.</p>
<p>The mind is constantly doubting its own convictions, its own realities. But beyond the mind, beyond the belief-reality, there is a reality which we can call conviction-reality. This conviction-reality is in the inmost recesses of our heart. Once we can become consciously one with our inner conviction, we will feel that at every moment we are given the golden opportunity to run fast, faster, fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The awakening of Kundalini is dangerous only when the seeker is not pure enough. If the seeker is impure on the physical, vital or mental planes, if he has not developed a sufficient amount of purity in his entire being, then it is dangerous. If the seeker is pure, and if it is God’s Will that the Kundalini power be awakened in him, then it will not be dangerous for him at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does it mean to misuse the Kundalini power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does it mean to misuse the Kundalini power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After the seeker awakens or develops the Kundalini power, if he immediately starts using it to satisfy his ego, not at the direction of God’s all-loving Will, then the Kundalini power will be misused. He will create danger in his life, and danger for those who are around him. But if the seeker listens to the dictates of his soul after he has brought the Kundalini power to the fore, then he cannot make the mistake of misusing the Kundalini power.</p>
<p>You misuse something when you are not directed by God’s Will. Suppose you have two dollars. Now, two individuals have approached you, and both of them tell you that they are in need of money. If you are a seeker, you should dive deep within to know what is God’s Will — whether He wants you to give your money-power to both of them, to one of them or to neither of them. If you do not dive deep within, you may decide to give a dollar to each one. Now, one may use the dollar for transportation to go to a spiritual place, to pray and meditate. But the other may take your dollar to go to a bar and drink. Now, if you had listened to the dictates of God, you would have heard the message to give the money-power only to the seeker who was going to use it for spiritual purpose, a divine purpose. But you gave your money-power to the wrong one, and his karma, the result of his action, will be worse because of your ignorance.</p>
<p>When we do something without listening to the Will of God, then we are misusing our capacities. We should try only to execute God’s Will. If we know what God’s Will is, then we do not care for the after-effect. By executing God’s Will we feel that we are fulfilled. But human nature has a peculiar way of deriving satisfaction. We feel that if somebody asks for something and we can give it to him, then naturally we are doing the right thing. But we have to know that we have come to earth not only to give, but to give to the right person, the person who is truly needful. If someone is not hungry and just because I have something I give it to him, I do not help that person, especially if I give it untimely.</p>
<p>Power should always be used at God’s choice Hour. At God’s choice Hour, God will inspire me to give you something or God will inspire you to give me something. But if it is not God’s choice Hour, and just because you have something you start giving it to others, then you are misusing your power, light-power, Kundalini power, money-power, any power. This way of using power is dangerous and in no way helps others. It only creates confusion and confusion is followed by destruction.</p>
