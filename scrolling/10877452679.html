  <h2 id="page-title">Part V: Negative forces</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V: Negative forces" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What are negative forces?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Negative forces are those forces that tell you that you are hopeless and useless, that you cannot realise God and that is useless to try. These are the forces that tell you not to pray and meditate because there is nothing in meditation. If you allow these negative forces to enter into you, if you become one with them, then you will feel that your life has no meaning.</p>
<p>Positive forces make you feel that you are God's chosen son and that you have the possibility and potentiality of doing something significant for God and for your own divinity at every moment. If you remain in the heart, you will encounter very few negative forces, practically none. But if you live in the mind, the negative forces will often threaten you. Today you may think that you have conquered the negative forces, but tomorrow they will attack you more powerfully and vehemently than you ever thought possible. It is almost impossible to conquer something with the mind. But with the heart, it is not only possible and practical, but inevitable that you will conquer all negative forces. As a matter of fact, in the pure, aspiring heart there is not even one single negative force. It is in the mind and in the vital, which is very near the heart, that the negative forces exist. In the mind they operate in a clever, roguish and stealthy manner. In the vital the negative forces use their power in a very aggressive way; there is no secrecy about them; they just come and attack.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We think that if we are nice to others, then everybody will be nice to us, but it is not true. You may be very nice, but I can be nasty. No matter how nice, pure or sincere you are, if there is a monkey beside you, the very nature of the monkey is to bite you. You think, "Oh, if I am a saint, the monkey is not going to bite me." You can be a saint but still the monkey will bite. So no matter how sincere you are, the very nature of the hostile forces is to attack.</p>
<p>I am a nice man, but two days ago while I was sitting on the playing field, a wasp came and stung me. I think I have more purity and spirituality than anyone else there, but of all the people it had to come to me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do wars result from the fact that we have not been able to reconcile our lives to our souls?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do wars result from the fact that we have not been able to reconcile our lives to our souls?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have not been able to enter into the soul's region, so we do not know what the soul wants from us. We do not have free access to the soul. Our soul may want us to do something, but the physical mind is constantly standing in its way. The physical mind does not cooperate at all with our inner existence.</p>
<p>What are we fighting against in the inner world? We are fighting against ignorance. This ignorance has to be nipped in the bud. As long as ignorance remains in our being, we will feel that the world is not ours. We will feel that it is something totally different from us which we have to possess. The moment we are freed from the grip of ignorance, we will feel the world deep within us. At that time, there is no need to possess it, since it is already ours.</p>
<p>Now we are fighting because we feel that a particular plot of land or country is not ours and we want to possess it. But when we are freed from ignorance, in our inner existence we will feel that the whole world is ours. It is not something to be fought for because deep within us it is already our possession.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful. Remain only in the heart, and not in the unaspiring mind or the unaspiring vital. When the mind and the vital really aspire, they will take their legitimate place alongside the heart. They will reveal and manifest the divine forces as their very own. They will learn the secret that the heart already knows: to claim everything and everyone as their very own and to see everything as an extension of their own consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Where are the hostile forces located?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Where are the hostile forces located?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don't have to go to hell or any particular place to see hostile, undivine forces. They are all around us, and also within us. It is only when we change our consciousness that wrong forces are really transformed. The world we are living in is full of ignorant forces, and they get malicious pleasure when they can disturb the poise of the divine forces. We have to try to avoid and ignore these malicious forces that intentionally try to disturb our poise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They may come to one person in a dream and try to attack him while in the case of another person they may attack in his waking hours when he is walking or driving a car. In the case of a third person they may attack during the time of meditation. Hostile forces are very clever. They attack when our own weaknesses are coming to the fore.</p>
