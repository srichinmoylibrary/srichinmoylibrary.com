<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As soon as I come in, I bring down Light, Peace and Bliss from above. I bring down a sea of Peace, Light and Bliss, and this moves around like waves of the ocean. It is not your mental hallucination: far from it. I bring down the sea and I represent the sea as well as the waves. In that wavy movement when I look around the room, I am actually entering into each disciple. This white light is the light of purity, inner purity, and also it is the Consciousness of God in the feminine form; that is to say, it is the Light of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Blue is the light of infinity, the light of spirituality. White light represents the Consciousness of the Divine Mother and also the soul's purity. Similarly, blue represents infinity and the essence of spirituality. My predominant colours are blue and gold. All the colours I embody, but the important colours in my life are blue and gold.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I bring down almost everything, but it is up to the disciples to achieve it or receive it. Suppose that today you need purity. Then you will receive purity more. The next time you may need light, so you will receive light. It depends on what you need. I am like a shopkeeper. I keep all things in my shop. It is up to you to buy whatever you want. If you want to buy this particular food, you buy it. If you want to buy something else, you can buy that. Here, when you buy, money-power is not necessary; you buy with aspiration. The more aspiration you can show, the more you are able to get the things that you need: Peace, Light, Bliss, Purity. Some days the shopkeeper sells one particular item more than other things. So, three or four or ten persons may see a white light today, because they need purity. There are many people who need peace. Most of the disciples need peace of mind. So I bring peace, and this peace you can take to your heart's content. Anything else you want you can also have.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, through the development of one's inner consciousness. If someone says that he has had a new birth, it means that he has achieved something in his inner life. A new world, a new consciousness, has dawned in him. Then you can say that it is a new birth.</p>
<p>In India, the brahmins at the age of twelve or thirteen are invested with the sacred thread. In the Jewish system also, at the age of thirteen, a boy gets a new life. It is a new consciousness that enters into the particular boy. In our case also, when we launch into the spiritual life and get higher experiences, deeper experiences, these experiences determine our new life.</p>
<p>So, in spiritual terms, we can have many lives in one human lifetime. So far as the question of evolution is concerned, inner evolution, we have many, many lives, countless lives.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes seekers want to get some tangible thing or some tangible reality from the Master. On the inner plane they have felt their soul or grown into some reality. Inner food they have got while meditating with me, but it is not enough. They also feel the need of outer food. They want something on the outer plane which will convince their physical minds. They feel that the outer offering also has conscious power. So I give them blessingful prasad, sanctified food, which has been blessed by my inner Pilot, who is everybody's Inner Pilot. Outer nourishment they get when they come into physical contact with me. So, when they get both inner and outer nourishment, their satisfaction is complete.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the soul's development. Mentally you will feel that you have not followed a prescribed course. You have not been going to school for two years or three years, whereas others have been studying in their schools. But you do not know when you actually started this journey. In your past incarnations, perhaps you meditated for years. If you have practised the spiritual life in your past incarnations, then even in your first attempt in this life you may get some spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Again, it can also happen through the Grace of the Supreme that you will get a firsthand experience after your first attempt. So there is no hard and fast rule. Many people get a spiritual experience when they meet their spiritual Master, even if they had not previously practised spirituality. Why? Because they enter into the soul of the Master with intense devotion: and when the devotion enters into the soul of the Master, his blessing or, you can say, his compassion or his light, immediately responds to the seeker's devotion. Then the seeker gets a firsthand experience.</p>
