<p><em>5th June 1923. Sri Aurobindo and C. R. Das. Sri Aurobindo's residence, Pondicherry.</em></p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> A serious problem, Aurobindo.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> What is it?</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> I wish to take to spirituality.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo (smiling):</em> How can it be a problem at all?</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> It is, Aurobindo.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> How?</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> Politics dogs me night and day.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> But you know the two cannot normally go together. The aims and ideals of the usual political activity are almost always opposed to those of spirituality, to say nothing of the forces at work in politics...</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> Ah, you have understood my problem. Aurobindo, help me into the spiritual life.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> I wish I could.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> What prevents you, dear friend? Aurobindo, you are to me something far more than even a dear friend. And you know that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> Chitta, you must be aware that you cannot make satisfactory progress in your inner life if you do not move away altogether from absorption in politics. It influences the consciousness in a very undesirable way.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> You are perfectly right. But...</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> I understand your difficulty. All right, then; you go on with your political activities, but at the same time do your best to live your inner life. Gradually you may find that your interest in politics is giving way to your interest in a higher life.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> What a burden you have taken off my shoulders! I see a ray of light and breathe in a little fresh air. But one thing more — I need your help also in another matter. Our "Swarajya Party" needs your unstinted support.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> I feel strongly for it. I give its stand my full inner support. You will always feel my presence in it.</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> I feel doubly relieved. With your presence in me, all will go well with me. Do you remember my prophecy about you at the trial — "His words will be echoed and re-echoed..."?</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> But what would Norton think of you if he were to overhear you?</p>
<p><em>C. R. Das:</em> Oh, he is now a different man. He works hand in hand with me. He now appears against the Government in political cases.</p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo:</em> Good that he is now on the side of the weak and the striving. His chivalry will pay.</p>

<h2>Six stories about <em>Chitta Ranjan Das: A larger than the largest heart</em></h2>

<p>There was once a great leader whose heart was larger than the largest. In law he was extremely successful and as a national leader he was also quite successful. His real name was kindness, affection and compassion. He was always for the poor and the miserable, and he used to help people far beyond their need. The tips he gave to the police, for example, were ten times the amount that they usually got from others.</p>
<p>"These policemen work so hard," he said. "Just because they wear Indian garments, we do not value them. But if the same work were done by Englishmen with trousers on, we would have to give them much more."</p>
<p>One day a man in the Congress who worked for the great leader came up to him crying. The great man said, "Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>He said, "I stay at your house, but just because I come from the lowest class, everyone goes away from me. I am given my food at the place where the dogs and the chickens stay. It is so dirty and filthy there. One of your servants brings my food and I eat there as if I were another dog or another chicken. Please do something for me."</p>
<p>Because of his low class, society did not permit him to sit with the members of the family. But still the great man felt very sad. He said to his wife, "Granted, he cannot sit and eat with us, but can you not at least give him a nice place to eat? Why does he have to eat with the dogs and chickens? Can he not be given a better place?"</p>
<p>His wife said, "Yes, he should be given a better place. I shall see to it."</p>
<p>Although the wife told the servant to take his food to a nice place, a few days later the servant was careless and took the food to the same place. So once more the Congress worker came to the great man, crying and crying: "They have given me the food there again, just because I come of a low class. I am staying with you because of your affection and love for me. Otherwise, I would not stay. This kind of treatment I hate. Whenever your Brahmin cooks see me, they run away. They show tremendous contempt for me and literally hate me. Am I not a human being?"</p>
<p>The great leader felt miserable, and he burst into tears. He called his wife and said, "From now on this young man will eat not only inside the house, but actually in the room where I eat. He has to eat in my room whenever I am eating. If I happen to be elsewhere and it is time for him to eat, he has to eat in my room. I make it a law."</p>
<p>This great man was Chitta Ranjan Das. He was known as the most beloved friend of Mother Bengal. It was he who saved Sri Aurobindo from jail. When he died, Tagore said, "You came into the world with an immortal heart and you left it here on your way back."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The kind-hearted barrister</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The kind-hearted barrister" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a middle-aged woman was found in the street most miserably and most pitifully weeping. A young barrister came out of a nearby house. He was on his way to court. When he saw the woman shedding bitter tears, he came up to her and asked why she was crying.</p>
<p>"I have walked here from a far-off place," the woman replied. "I have come only to see you. In my village I have heard so much about you. People say that you are extremely kind-hearted, extremely generous and extremely self-giving. Tomorrow is my only daughter's wedding. Alas, I do not have enough money to give her a proper marriage ceremony. I am so miserable. I know that tomorrow, if the wedding does not go well, some people will sympathise with me without helping me in any way. Others will laugh at me. Still others will just hate me. I have decided if tomorrow I cannot give my daughter a decent wedding, a proper wedding, I shall commit suicide. Now that you have heard my story, is there any way you can help me out of this sad plight?"</p>
<p>The young barrister said, "Right now I do not have any money with me. Please tell me how much money you actually need."</p>
<p>The woman mentioned a certain sum and the young barrister continued, "This evening try to be here at this same place. I shall without fail give you money and make you happy. Do not feel sad any more."</p>
<p>In the evening the young barrister returned home and as he neared his house he saw the woman waiting for him in exactly the same place. He presented her with ten times more money than she needed. The woman was speechless. She could only gaze at him with eyes full of gratitude. He smiled and said to her, "I am really happy that I could be of some help to you at this moment of your life."</p>
<p>This young barrister's name was Chitta Ranjan Das.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chitta Ranjan incognito</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chitta Ranjan incognito" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On another occasion an elderly man was waiting for the young barrister. He had heard all about Chitta Ranjan Das. He knew that in addition to being extremely kind-hearted and generous, Chitta Ranjan always tried to be of service to the poor and the needy. This elderly man had walked from a distant village. He had never seen Chitta Ranjan personally and he did not know what he looked like. By making enquiries along the way, he had discovered where the young barrister lived, and so he decided to wait in the street with the hope of meeting Chitta Ranjan.</p>
<p>As the elderly man sat on the footpath, recovering from his long journey, a young man came up to him and kindly asked if he could be of any assistance to him. The elderly man immediately began to give a full account of his woes. He explained that he was in terrible financial difficulty. He could not afford to send his children to school; he could not even continue to feed his family. They were depending entirely on him to save them, but all his efforts to find employment had come to nothing. He desperately needed 2,000 rupees. The elderly man concluded by saying, "I am waiting here with the hope of speaking to him as he passes by. Is there any way that you can give him my message?"</p>
<p>The young man was puzzled. "Who is it that you are waiting to see?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I want to see Chitta Ranjan Das, who is always so kind and compassionate to the poor."</p>
<p>"I happen to know him well," the young man said. "He is now in court. If you come with me I shall take you to him."</p>
<p>Then he took the elderly man by car to the high court and showed him to a small room. "Please be seated. I shall go and speak with Chitta Ranjan Das and I assure you that you will be given the necessary amount."</p>
<p>In ten minutes' time a junior clerk entered the room and gave the elderly man an envelope containing the necessary amount. The elderly man was so grateful. He begged the junior clerk, "Is there any way I can meet the man who has been so kind to me? He has saved my family from utter ruin. I wish to express my gratitude to him and to receive his blessings. Do you think he could spare a few moments?"</p>
<p>The junior clerk replied, "He has already spent a full hour with you! Now he is so busy with his other responsibilities."</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed the elderly man. "How is it possible?"</p>
<p>"Do you not recall that he brought you here in his own car?" said the junior clerk.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">To clear his father&#039;s name</h2><span property="dc:title" content="To clear his father&#039;s name" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The father of Chitta Ranjan Das, Bhuvan Mohan Das, was forced to declare insolvency. I do not know about America, but in India it brings great shame on the family to be reduced to this situation. His son was so sad and embarrassed that he took it upon himself to repay the entire sum of Rs. 75,000. He was not financially responsible for his father's debts under the British Law, but his high sense of duty and honour compelled him to clear his father's name. The British Justice who was presiding over the case said, "An act of this kind is not to be seen even in Europe." From that time, Chitta Ranjan Das started giving away money to help the needy.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-five years old I wrote about this incident in an essay devoted to Chitta Ranjan Das. It is published in my book <em>Mother India's Lighthouse</em>. In life sometimes we create something and we get the results after 40 or 50 years! I wrote the essay in 1957 and now in 1993 — so many years later — I will be meeting with his grandson Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who has become the Indian Ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>Once a very large meeting took place at Bhabananda Park in Calcutta. C. R. Das was presiding over the meeting and his wife, Basanti Devi, was beside him.</p>
<p>The eminent scientist, P.C. Ray, said to them, "Here I see a real king and a real queen. Although they are without crowns, we are all ready to listen to their commands most willingly and most gratefully."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God alone knows who is deserving</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God alone knows who is deserving" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a very poor Brahmin came to C. R. Das and begged him for a large sum of money so that he could take care of his children and also his children's studies and pay back his debts. C. R. Das's heart melted at the pitiful condition of the poor Brahmin and he gave him a cheque for 10,000 rupees. The Brahmin was overjoyed and extremely, extremely grateful to C. R. Das.</p>
<p>At the time, a friend of C. R. Das happened to be standing nearby. When the poor Brahmin left, the friend said to C. R. Das, "What have you done? It is good to give money to the poor, but such a large amount? How do you know he deserves such a large amount of money? Are you not giving money indiscriminately?"</p>
<p>C. R. Das said, "I do not know whether I am giving money away indiscriminately or discriminately, but I do feel that it is up to God to judge as to whether I am doing the right thing or not."</p>
<p>Just at that moment, one of his assistants came up to C. R. Das with a telegram. C. R. Das opened the telegram and saw that an offer of 20,000 rupees had come from a certain King if he would accept a forthcoming legal case. Twenty thousand rupees the King was prepared to give him just to accept the case! C. R. Das said to his friend, "You see, I gave ten. Now I get twenty. So, God knows what is best for you, best for him, best for me, best for everyone. God alone knows who is deserving or undeserving. My business is to be of service to mankind, specially to those who are very, very poor."</p>

<p>For eight months<br /> Subhas was with Deshabandhu<br /> In the same jail.<br /> The closer he became,<br /> The deeper grew his love and admiration<br /> For his mentor.<br /> The saying "Familiarity breeds contempt"<br /> Was, for him and also for others<br /> Who subscribed to his view,<br /> Nothing short of absurdity.</p>

<p>SRI CHINMOY (B. 1931) is the author of more than 1,340 books of poems, aphorisms, short stories, plays and essays on spiritual themes. His seven major plays portray the lives of the great Avatars — Sri Ramachandra, Sri Krishna, the Buddha, the Christ, Sri Chaitanya, Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo. He has also written about the American revolutionary leaders, the Moghul court of Akbar, and various other kings, saints and sages as well as the pastimes of the Indian cosmic gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>Writing from the unique inner perspective of a spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy fully identifies with the experiences of his subjects, and we gain new insights into the spiritual impulses that have guided mankind for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy was born in Chittagong, East Bengal. He grew up in a spiritual community in South India, where this present play — one of his earliest — was first written. In 1964, in response to a call from Above, Sri Chinmoy came to America, making his home in New York. He now serves as a Guru to several thousand students around the world and has established meditation centres in many countries. Sri Chinmoy has dedicated his life to the establishment of world peace. In addition to his prayers and meditations, he offers tremendous inspiration to all who come in contact with him by virtue of his abundant creativity, which he expresses through literature, music, art and sporting activities.</p>
