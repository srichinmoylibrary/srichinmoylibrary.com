 <p>
SLT 86-95. Sri Chinmoy made a short visit to Florida in November 1981.</p>
<h2>Do you want a cigar?</h2>

<p>The first day in Florida while I was running, I saw a young man smoking a cigar. He said to me, "Do you want to have a cigar?"</p>
<p>I waved my hand and said, "No, thank you."</p>
<p>The man ran after me and said, "You thank me and you are not taking one?"</p>
<p>This time I got mad at him, and he stopped bothering me.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes I saw a very nice old man running with his hands behind his head. He said to me, "Good morning."</p>
<p>I asked him, "Is there any reason why you are doing that?"</p>
<p>He answered, "To strengthen my chest."</p>
<p>In silence I said, "You don't need to, but I want to strengthen my chest."</p>

<p>Another time I was running on a very cold day. Florida also can be quite cold in the winter. A newspaper boy saw me around five o'clock in the morning. He said to me, "Don't keep running. Go home. You will get frozen."</p>
<p>He advised me not to run, but on that day I ran thirteen miles.</p>
<p>On that cold day I ran by a girl waiting for the bus. Half an hour later, when I was returning, she was still waiting in that cold weather.</p>

<p>One day I went to Sears because somebody told me that there was a section with a variety of birds. But there were no birds there; they had only bird food. It was quite cold, so I bought a long-sleeved T-shirt for nineteen dollars. Then, since it was cold, I put the shirt on in the store, and I was wearing it.</p>
<p>O God, one of the guards came up to me. He suspected that I had just taken the shirt, and he was about to ask me to show him the receipt. Usually, I never keep any receipts; that is not in my line. Luckily, this time I had put the receipt in my pocket, so I showed it to him. After I showed it to him, he said, "Oh no, I was not suspecting you." But he did take the receipt from me and look at it.</p>

<p>The people at Sears told me about another shop very nearby which sold flowers, plants and so forth. When I went there, I saw two toy elephants for six dollars. Sometimes I tell you people what you were in your previous animal incarnations. In X's case, in her last animal incarnation she was an elephant, so I wanted to buy her these elephants. By this time she has a very large collection of elephants.</p>
<p>I said, "Let me buy these two toy elephants." I went to give the lady behind the counter six dollars. She said, "Why six dollars?"</p>
<p>I said, "It is mentioned there, six dollars."</p>
<p>She said. "The price is three dollars."</p>
<p>I said "Three dollars?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Here this lady was telling me that I was giving too much money, and just two minutes before that I was about to be arrested.</p>

<p>While I was running, I saw a train going by, and I stopped to watch it. After it passed by, even then I didn't have the inclination to start running again. I was only enjoying the magic sound of the train.</p>
<p>I really like train journeys. In my childhood my only desire was to work for a railroad. I never lost my fascination for trains. Even after realising God, I still have that fascination. So every time I see a train I get a very special thrill.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Airport rogues</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Airport rogues" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I brought three birds to the airport with me to take back to New York. The last time I came back from Florida, some rogue airport workers charged me twenty-seven dollars for carrying a bird, but this time I didn't have to pay anything. Savyasachi put the birds in a box, and I kept the box with my hand luggage.</p>
<p>I was originally supposed to leave from Fort Lauderdale, but I was returning from Miami instead. The lady at the ticket counter asked her supervisor if there was any difference in the price of my ticket. The supervisor looked at my ticket and said, "Six dollars," very quickly. If I were supposed to pay extra, they would have told me. Since they did not ask me to stand in line and pay, that meant that they were supposed to give me back six dollars as a refund. But instead of giving me my refund, the lady said, "You don't have to stand here," and she told me to stand in another line at the boarding gate, beyond the place where they check your bags. I didn't have the heart to fight with them. They would have kept me for twenty minutes just for six dollars!</p>
<p>These two were not losing or gaining anything by not giving me the money. But who wanted to stand there and argue with them? The last time I flew back from Florida, the airline workers charged me twenty-seven dollars for the bird I was carrying, and then they put the money in their own pockets. The man from whom I bought the birds told me that he takes birds quite often on airplanes and never pays anything. He said that the men who charged me twenty-seven dollars last time at the airport had cheated me. But this time these people were not even gaining anything.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>The blue birds</h2>

<p>In Mexico City we went to a store where there were unbelievable birds. Had I been a millionaire, I would have bought them all, but instead I bought five. One bird I got was so beautiful. I couldn't have imagined that such a beautiful bird existed! It is called a golden pheasant. I have been to so many places and seen many, many beautiful birds. But all the birds we got that day were exceptionally beautiful, and I had never seen any of them before.</p>
<p>When I was about to pay for the birds, there were six persons standing near the cash register. One of the two blue birds flew out of the cage, but nobody noticed, including me. Then a young boy standing nearby grabbed the bird. It was only after he brought the bird back to us that we looked into the cage and saw that one bird was missing. After that we saw that the boy's thumb was bleeding. We thanked him, but the boy didn't speak English.</p>
<p>If he had not been kind enough to catch the bird, we would have had only one of the blue birds and not two.</p>

<p>One day in Mexico City I left my hotel room early in the morning, leaving one of my wallets on the dresser there. It had a large amount of money, both in American dollars and Mexican bills. I knew perfectly well that the wallet was in the hotel room. You can call it lethargy, or you can call it confidence and faith in the chambermaid, but I didn't take the trouble of going back during the day to get it.</p>
<p>I came back at night only to discover that my wallet was intact; not even a dollar was removed. I know how I keep my dollar bills, and the wallet had not even been opened. To have this kind of experience anywhere in the world is very, very, very rare.</p>
<p>So some people are very nice. I am Pranavananda's disciple. After he lost his wallet, he said, "Some people are space cadets." I still can't believe that I left my wallet on my dresser, and at night it was in perfect order.</p>
<p>Later I asked who the lady was who cleaned my room. Then I gave her some money because nothing had been stolen.</p>

<p>It is very rare for hotel managers to be so nice. Usually they are very suspicious.</p>
