<p>Let me try. First of all, faith is not credulity or blind belief. It does not mean that you must constantly believe in the impossible. No, that is not faith. Faith is a spontaneous feeling. It does not care for human justification. It is the eye that visions the future and is always in tune with a higher truth. The door of faith is always open to the Truth-Beyond and, by virtue of faith, we transcend ourselves.</p>

<p>Please try to feel from now on that there is Somebody around you who does not want anything from you except joy. There is Somebody who wants you always to swim in the Sea of Joy and Delight. If you can remain in joy — I don't mean the outer joy of going here and there, mixing with people, buying material things — but if you can have real joy and inner fulfilment, then you will automatically have faith in God.</p>
<p>When we are worried, or are afraid of something, we immediately try to create a kind of self-imposed faith in God. This is not true faith. When we are in danger, we say, "God, save me, save me!" But we say this only to avert danger. This is an escape. This kind of faith does not last. Everything is inside a person, both joy and fulfilment. But who is the possessor of this inner fulfilment? It is God. We are just His devoted instruments. When we feel spontaneous inner joy as part and parcel of our life, and we feel its source, we can then have faith in God, the possessor of infinite Joy. From now on, please try to feel your own inner joy, and faith will come to you spontaneously. In regard to your outer frustrations, please do not try to unite them with your inner joy. Please separate your inner joy from the outer happenings. Only then will you be able to strengthen your faith in God,</p>

<p>I fully sympathies with you. You are not alone. There are a good many human souls sailing in the same boat. The study of books and scriptures can give us information to quote and a certain understanding. It can give us, at most, inspiration, but nothing more. By borrowing others' ideas, we can never be truly enlightened in our inner life. It is by studying the eternal book of Truth within us, by listening constantly to the Voice of the inner Self, that we can become spiritually illumined. It is then that we will find joy in our outer life. We must see God first, and then we can become Godlike. If we want to be truly Godlike, our talking must give way to becoming. Let me tell you a true story.</p>
<p>In a certain village in Bengal, India, a rich man's servant went to his master's house every day by crossing a river in a ferry boat. One day there was a violent storm. The ferry could not cross the raging river and the servant, who was forced to go many miles out of his way to a foot bridge, was late in arriving. His master was furious. "You fool," he shouted, "if you utter Krishna's name three times, you will see that you don't need a boat. You will be able to walk across the river!"</p>
<p>That afternoon, as the storm showed no signs of abating, the poor servant was threatened with the same situation. But, in his simple faith, he obeyed his master's instructions. From the very depths of his heart he uttered the name of Krishna. Lo, the miracle of miracles! He felt a power propelling him towards the water, and he was able to walk upon the very waves. Thus he crossed the river. When he heard the story, the master's joy knew no bounds. A swelling pride rose in his heart. Was it not his advice that had brought about the success? "I never knew that my advice had such great power," he thought. "Let me enjoy this miracle myself."</p>
<p>So he went to the river, which was now calm and serene, and uttered Krishna's name three times. Then he began to cross. But fear and doubt tortured his whole being, and although he shouted the sacred name hundreds of times, his attempt was fruitless. He drowned.</p>
<p>Now what do we learn from this story? The servant had sincere faith in his master. He also had an implicit faith in Lord Krishna. It was this absolute faith in a divine power that saved him and proved the power of Krishna's grace.</p>
<p>Similarly, a speaker, in spite of his own lame faith, can inspire a genuine faith in his listeners. But it is by being truly spiritual himself that he can help others most significantly. If we want to convince others of the Truth, our highest authority comes only from direct knowledge of Truth and not from any scripture. In the divine Play unillumined authority plays the role of the lamp, while Truth-in-realisation plays the role of the Light.</p>

<p>In your case, I feel that you should remain with your wife and child. Today you want to leave them; tomorrow you may want to leave God. It is not by leaving aside humanity that you will be able to realise God. If you remain with your family, your realisation will be deeper and more fulfilling. True, at a certain stage of the spiritual journey, the renunciation of the gross material life is necessary, but at a higher stage it is no longer necessary. At the highest stage, we neither seek nor renounce anything.</p>

<p>No. There can be many roads leading to the same goal. One road may have many beautiful flowers on either side; another road may have only a few blossoms; a third road may have none at all. If three seekers each follow a different road. according to their souls' needs and preferences, each of them will reach the Ultimate Goal.</p>
<p>Of course, experiences do give you additional confidence in yourself. They encourage you and energise you to march farther and farther. They also give enormous delight. And while you are having the experiences you may feel the presence of an invisible Guide within your being, pushing you towards the light of Truth so that you may be blessed with full Realisation.</p>
<p>But you can also have full and complete Realisation without so-called "experiences." Your expanding consciousness, as you grow into God, is itself a solid "experience."</p>

<p>My friend, as you will go to God when you leave the body, so will I. Let us be wise. Our business is to go to God; it is God's business if He wants to keep us in Heaven or send us back to earth. The best thing is to surrender to God and let Him fulfil us in His own way. Having thrown aside all our preconceived ideas regarding the existence or non-existence of rebirth, let us do the only thing of importance: be one with His Will and Consciousness.</p>

<p>I am happy to answer this question of questions. The answer is quite simple. To pray to God or to work as God wants us to work — both ways are of supreme importance. Both are certain means to an inevitable end. And that end is God-realisation.</p>

<p>Certainly it helps. The attitude of service, the attitude of devotion and the quest for knowledge, taken all together, will help us make a balanced progress. But at some point in our life we will have to find the one that inspires us most and give it most importance. Each soul has its own way of moving. Here on earth, we are inspired to progress according to our soul's propensity. If we accept all these paths, it is a great help; at the same time, we have to pay most attention to our own soul's way, the way that gives us the greatest fulfilment according to our deepest aspiration.</p>

<p>First you have to read a few spiritual books which explain the various ways to start meditation. Then you start. Soon you will see that reading books is not enough. You will feel that you need a teacher, who will know which kind of meditation will best suit your nature and soul. If you do not have a teacher, pray to God to reveal within you the kind of meditation you should adopt. Then, during a dream or in your silent mood, God will make you feel what you should do. Now you can begin your journey.</p>
<p>When your meditation is correct, you will feel a kind of joy all over your body. But if you do not feel that joy, if, on the contrary, you feel a mental tension or disturbance, then you should know that the kind of meditation you are doing is not meant for you and is not advisable. When you get a feeling of spontaneous inner joy, then the meditation you have adopted is correct.</p>

<p>Each person has his own way of meditating. What actually happens is that sometimes an individual gets from within himself a kind of meditation. In other words, the inner being comes forward and tells the individual to pray or meditate in this or that way, that this or that will help. Sometimes the seeker meets a spiritual figure who can easily enter into him and know everything about his inner and outer life, seeing his growth and development and aspiration. Then this spiritual teacher can tell him how and when to meditate.</p>
<p>When you have a teacher you are extremely lucky, especially if the teacher is a genuine one. If you don't have a teacher, but if you have genuine aspiration, God within you will tell you the correct meditation. It is not possible for everyone in the world to have a spiritual teacher. If you do not get one, what will happen? We are all God's children. God wants all of us to realise Him. So, if you get a teacher, well and good. If not, go deep within to discover your own meditation.</p>

<p>I fully understand. But if you get a teacher who is a realised soul, you can go to him for help and find out if what you are doing is correct. Or if you do not get a spiritual teacher, please go deep, deep within and see if you get a voice or a thought or an idea. Then go deep into the voice or thought or idea, and see if it gives you a feeling of inner joy or peace, where there are no questions or problems or doubts. When you get this kind of peace and inner joy, you can feel that the voice that you have heard is correct, that it is the real inner voice which will help you in your spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What is the difference between the voice of Silence and the voice of Yoga? Or isn&#039;t there any difference?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="What is the difference between the voice of Silence and the voice of Yoga? Or isn&#039;t there any difference?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is a difference. The voice of Silence will give you a particular piece of knowledge, a particular truth. When you enter into your inner being, into the inner realm where Silence really exists, if you need a particular message you will get it.</p>
<p>But Yoga encompasses everything; it is the whole field. In Yoga you will get Silence; you will also get Peace, Light and Power. You will get everything. The voice of Yoga is for all seekers and especially for those who have seriously entered into the spiritual life. The voice of Silence is meant for a particular seeker at a particular time. During your meditation, for example, you can go deep within and you will hear the voice of Silence. But the voice of Yoga you can have all the time. During your outer as well as your inner movements, you can hear the voice of Yoga. Since you have entered into the spiritual life, you will get spiritual vibrations, thoughts, ideas and messages. All these divine things will be coming to you from the voice of Yoga.</p>
