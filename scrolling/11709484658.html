<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are inspired to dedicate yourself completely and unconditionally, then you get a kind of thrill. When you get a thrill, not simply from inspiration, but from action, then you can rest assured that it is the satisfaction of your soul. When you have started acting divinely, then you feel the soul’s satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While on earth, the soul remains in the body. When the soul finally leaves, the body dies. During the course of our lifetime, the soul usually leaves the body only for a few minutes at a time. Definitely the soul leaves many, many times to visit other souls or other human beings. Each person’s soul goes to visit other persons, but more than eleven hours if the soul remains outside the body, there is a serious danger that the soul may not be able to come back into that body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not use our imagination to see our soul. By imagining and imagining our high, higher, highest meditation of the past, we can enter into that high meditation once again and give new life to our present meditation. In that case, imagination becomes a solid reality. But we do not use imagination to see our soul. True, we may imagine something, but the soul can take any form it wants to take. We may imagine the soul in one way, but the reality may be totally different. To see the soul, one has to aspire sincerely, aspire devotedly, aspire self-givingly. Not by imagination but by aspiration one can see the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the soul ever make a mistake in choosing a particular physical body, mind or vital in order to fulfil its mission?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the soul ever make a mistake in choosing a particular physical body, mind or vital in order to fulfil its mission?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people say that it does, but I am of the opinion that the soul does not make a mistake. On the highest plane the soul makes a decision according to its capacity, but it may have the same experience as a human mother. A human mother wants to have a very good son, but if the son becomes delinquent, the mother says, “I made a mistake by bringing this particular person into the world.” In the case of the soul, it is not a mistake. The soul sees the potentiality and possibility. It may expect the body, vital and mind to accomplish something by a certain date, but if the body, vital and mind are not aspiring at all, they delay. The soul is very beautiful, but the body, vital and mind may be very undivine. At that time we human beings say the soul made a mistake, but the difficulty is that the body, vital and mind are not as spiritual as the soul.</p>
<p>If the members of a particular family are very undivine, we may feel that the poor soul came into a bad family. Again, we have to remember that the soul itself chose to take incarnation in that family. If I make a choice, I have to be fully responsible for that choice. The soul expects someone to be very good, spiritual and divine. It is not a mistake; it is only that the soul starts its journey with a kind of hope. It is we human beings who make mistakes with our constant insecurity, jealousy and impurity. The soul does not suffer in that way. The soul says, “I brought this body, vital and mind into the world to do something great and good,” but owing to ignorance and many wrong forces, the body, vital and mind are not able to comply with the request of the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: At what point do seekers who do not have the guidance of a living Master become responsible for knowing the will of their soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: At what point do seekers who do not have the guidance of a living Master become responsible for knowing the will of their soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If an individual does not have a spiritual Master and does not practise spirituality, then the soul will never expect him to know the soul’s will. But if the individual is a sincere seeker, then his sincerity will make him responsible for knowing the will of his soul. If he does not have a Master, no harm. If one has accepted the spiritual life, one does not need a Master to know the will of the soul. His utmost sincerity will get the answer. But if one has a Master, it expedites his progress. The Master can tell the disciple, “This is what your soul wants.” The other way is a very long process. If you have no teacher, self-doubt can come in. You may say, “I am only a human being; I do not have higher guidance.” That is self-doubt. Even when you are doing the right thing, you may feel you are doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Once we accept the spiritual life very seriously and sincerely, we are responsible for knowing the will of our soul. If we do not listen to our soul, we will always make mistakes. If we do not know the will of the soul, our progress will be extremely, extremely slow. We must try — through our prayer, meditation, aspiration and self-giving — to know the will of the soul. This is the only way we can know the will of the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have heard that people can receive guidance from the soul, not only during meditation and other times of listening to the “still, small voice within,” but even by writing out a question and then listening inwardly and writing down the response they hear.

Can you comment on this process?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can listen to the dictates of the soul, or feel the presence of the inner voice, without being guided by a very deep meditation. Even in the hustle and bustle of life we can hear the inner voice, but if we meditate, then it becomes extremely easy to listen to the voice within. Without practising spirituality we may hear the inner voice, we may even see the soul, but we will doubt our experience. We will say, “This cannot be the soul; this voice is not coming from the soul.” But if we have a very good, deep meditation, we can hear the voice, we can see the soul with inner certainty.</p>
<p>Meditation is the best way. The other way, we may hear the voice, but we will not know for sure that it is the voice of the soul. It is by meditating that we are convinced that we are hearing the voice of the soul or seeing the soul. If we do not meditate, there will be self-doubt. Even if we see the soul, we will say, “This cannot be my soul.”</p>

For example, why would a soul be an ordinary cat instead of a majestic lion? Or a beggar instead of a doctor who helps people?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the Supreme never limits the choice — not at all. The Supreme creates the soul. As He creates a soul for a cat, even so He can create a soul for a human being. Everything is in the process of evolution, and evolution is a slow process. The Supreme does not limit the soul. Whatever form the soul wants to take, the Supreme allows. But if the Supreme wants a particular soul to be inside the body of a cat, it has to take that form, because it is a divine game. In a game all the participants do not play the same role. In football, somebody will be a goalkeeper, somebody will be a halfback and somebody will be a fullback. So many different positions they take! Like that, each soul also has to play a special role. In the process of evolution it has to go through many experiences.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can, but if you pray to the Supreme, that is more advisable. The Supreme is infinitely more compassionate than your own soul. If the Supreme forgives you, then the soul cannot say anything. If the soul sees that the body, vital, mind and heart are committing the same mistake again and again, then the soul feels sad if the Supreme does not punish them for being so undivine. But if you pray to the Supreme for forgiveness and the Supreme forgives you, then the soul is also bound to forgive you. It is like a high school teacher and a high school principal. The high school teacher may be displeased with you; he may even want to throw you out. But the principal has the right to keep you.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, if you have betrayed the soul or if you have not paid any attention to the soul, then you can pray to the soul for forgiveness if you want to. But instead of praying to the soul, the best thing is to pray to the Supreme for forgiveness. That is the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ghosts are dissatisfied vital beings. The soul is not a vital being. A dissatisfied vital being takes the form of a ghost. The soul is all-loving, all-knowing. It will never play the role of a ghost. The soul comes for illumination and perfection. It is absurd to say that the soul would take the form of a ghost.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, when something very special happens, it has something special to do with the heart of the place or the place itself. If something very spiritual is happening, the soul is bound to be there and the place is bound to be significant. This is not the case for silly, ordinary, mundane events, but if something very special is going on at a particular place, the soul’s divinity has to visit that place and stay there for some time to watch what is happening. If necessary, it will illumine or transform what is happening. Again, if something positive is happening, the soul of the place tries to expedite the journey of the seekers.</p>
