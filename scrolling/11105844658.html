  <h2 id="page-title">Humility</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Humility" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God is great because He alone embodies perfect humility. God is greater because He reveals humility on earthly soil through our climbing aspiration. God is the greatest of all because He has not separated His Transcendental Glory from His most humble creation, the blade of grass!</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, there can be nothing greater than humility. True inner wisdom lies in humility. One has to be humble to whom? One has to be humble to the one whom he has accepted as a Guide or Pilot in his inner life.</p>
<p>Now some people are humble only in the inner life; in the outer life they are very rude; they know everything. When it is a matter of aspiration, they are humble to their Master; when it is a matter of worldly wisdom, they think that they know infinitely more than the Master. The Master is then helpless. I wish to say that a spiritual Master, even in the outer world, is more capable of seeing the Truth than a worldly trained person because the Master is in constant touch with the Highest, the Supreme.</p>
<p>Very often someone's doctor tells him something, and I tell him something else. Now I am not an M.D. I do not have a doctor's qualifications. But I wish to tell you that I enter into the patient's body infinitely faster than the X-ray machine. Then if the Supreme wants me to tell the disciple what he should do, I tell him. Naturally, at that time, the disciple should listen to me and not to the doctor. Again, I am humble to doctors because they are also doing God's work and are fulfilling God in their own way. But when there is a conflict between the doctor and a spiritual person, between the medical doctor and the spiritual doctor, I wish my disciples to understand that I go to the ultimate Source and then I tell them the absolute Truth.</p>
<p>It is not only in the case of your illnesses but in all aspects of your lives. When I tell you something about your outer life, your family life, your business life, your office life, I wish you to feel that I am telling you this from the Highest Source. But if you feel, "No, you don't understand, because you haven't met such-and-such a person, or learned such-and-such a skill," then I am not ready to help you. Even where you have had forty or fifty years of experience in practising some profession or dealing with some situation, if I say, "Do this!" then you should be wise and humble and listen to me. The outer results may be temporarily painful or hurtful or even apparently harmful, but inside the process is being worked out and fulfilled in accordance with God's Plan, and almost immediately the problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Beyond the physical is the spiritual and it is in the spiritual that the real Truth lies. It is from the spiritual, from the subtle physical, that one can most effectively change the physical. So when it is a matter of action in the physical world, I wish to tell those of you who have really accepted me that if you take a true humble attitude, then I can act. At that time I can run and I can make you run speedily. If you have the inner conviction that what the Master is saying is absolutely correct, if you feel this with full sincerity and with the spontaneous joy of acceptance, then you are my true disciple and your life can be a song of freedom and oneness with me.</p>
<p>Very often my disciples listen to me either when it suits their purpose or when I tell them to do what they themselves want to do and they are delighted. Or after they have tried everything on their own without asking my advice and find that there is no way out and they are blocked, this becomes the time to offer their deep humility or surrender and they call me up. I must not feel sad, but I feel that I am not given the proper chance, not given the full opportunity to act with or through these disciples.</p>
<p>If there is no constant humility on the disciple's part, then the Master is really digging in a barren field. I am a farmer, a sincere farmer; I cultivate and cultivate, but from some disciples I do not get any crop, not to speak of a bumper crop. Why? Because what I want to give is very rarely accepted with humility.</p>
<p>Humility is the real secret of the spiritual life. If you want to make immediate progress, you have to be humble, not only in the inner life, but also in the outer life. Then only will you realise God sooner than you expect. Otherwise I am working, concentrating and meditating in vain. Something else is necessary along with my action and that is a real, spiritual attitude on your part. And what is the real spiritual attitude? It is humility.</p>
<p>If we knock at God's door without humility, God's door will never open. So let us go and knock as humbly as possible at the door of the Supreme, Him to realise, Him to fulfil.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Joy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Joy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The world is crying for only one thing and that thing is Joy. God Himself is trying to establish only one thing on earth and that thing is Joy. What you call Joy, we call in the deeper philosophy, Bliss. This Bliss comes only when we want to know the Truth, feel the Truth, realise the Truth and become the Truth. Until we become the Truth, there can be no abiding Joy. And there can be no greater or deeper Joy than to be constantly and unreservedly one with the Will of the Inner Pilot, the Supreme.</p>
<p>Very often people are confused by the words "Joy" and "pleasure," and mistake pleasure for Joy. Pleasure is something that binds, something that is fleeting. Pleasure immediately is followed by frustration, anxiety, worry, depression and so forth. But Joy, real Joy, is something that constantly grows and flows, something that gives us the feeling that we can walk farther, dive deeper, fly higher.</p>
<p>When we truly embody Joy, inner Joy, we become the perfect expression of God's Vision, Promise and Reality. What is God's Vision? God's Vision is that each human being can be as perfect, compassionate, powerful and merciful as God is. That is His Vision. What is His Promise? God's Promise is that He will make each individual feel that he can eventually become God Himself. And what is God's Reality? God's Reality is that each individual is already God, unmanifested. So when we really possess inner Joy, we are endowed with God's Vision, God's Promise and God's Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Light</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Light" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Light and darkness. Darkness makes us feel that we are nothing and can do nothing, that we are useless. Light makes us feel that we are everything, that we can do everything, that we can become everything. Now where is Light, real Light? Real Light is not in the physical; it is not in the mind. It is deep in the soul. Wherever there is Light, there is expansion. Expansion of what? Expansion of Truth. Light is the constant expression of Truth. Light and Truth go together. Darkness and conflict go together.</p>
<p>The light that we say we get from friends, relatives and worldly people is no real light. It is only a chain of thoughts and ideas, which we give value to. We always feel that others have more understanding and more knowledge than we. But I wish to say that you will have more light than anybody when you stay in the soul. Your soul has infinitely more light than anybody who is giving you intellectual information or outer knowledge.</p>
<p>Now how can you enter into the soul in order to see, feel and utilise the Light? You can reach the light by throwing off fear, the fear that is around you, in front of you, behind you and ahead of you. You are the victim of fear both in your own life and in the life of your loved ones: fear about your children, your friends, your country, your earth. If you have fear, you cannot enter into the soul and get the soul's Light. So please try to discard fear from your outer and your inner life. Then you will see that you are constantly being nourished by your soul's Light. A sincere aspirant also receives light when he enters into the Master's consciousness. The Master's consciousness is always inundated with spiritual Light, the Light of the Beyond.</p>
<p>Light and aspiration go together. Light reveals and manifests life only when aspiration ceaselessly feeds our inner hunger.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Love</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Love" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>First of all, let us try to know what love is. If love means to possess someone or something, then that is not real love, not pure love. If loves means to give oneself, to become one with everything and everyone, then that is real love. Real love is total oneness with the object loved and with the Possessor of love. And who is the Possessor of love? God. Without love, we cannot become one with God. Love is the inner bond, the inner connection, the inner link between man and God, between the finite and the infinite.</p>
<p>Love is the secret key to open God's Door. We must always approach God through love. The first step is love; the second step is devotion; the third step is surrender. First we have to love God; then we have to devote ourselves to Him alone; and finally we have to be at His Feet and fulfil ourselves. So if we go through our life's journey with absolute love, we can never fail to reach God or fulfil Him in our own lives or in humanity. Where there is pure love, divine love, there is fulfilment. Where there is no divine love, it is all misery, frustration and, ultimately, spiritual death.</p>
<p>Your children need your love. Your wife needs your love. But you need God's Love. God is ready to give you His Love. But you are not ready. You are ready to give your love to your daughter and your wife. But they are not ready. When you are ready to receive Love from God, to your amazement you will see that your wife and children will also be ready to receive love from you. Not one second before!</p>
<p>As we cannot exist on earth without life, so also God does not and cannot exist without His all-embracing, all-nourishing and all-fulfilling Love.</p>

<p>Luminosity is one of the divine qualities of the soul. But each soul need not and does not express itself through luminosity. It can use other divine qualities such as Peace, Bliss and Power. One does not have to cry for luminosity. Luminosity is bound to come if one is absolutely pure in the physical, genuinely sincere in the mind and soulfully aspiring in the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Nirvana</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Nirvana" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 

<p><em>No mind, no form, I only exist . . .</em></p>
<p><em>The final end of Nature's dance,</em></p>
<p><em>I am it whom I have sought . . .</em></p>
<p><em>I barter nothing with time and deeds;</em></p>
<p><em>My cosmic play is done.</em></p>
<p>[From "The Absolute"]</p>

<p>When one's cosmic play is done, one enters into Nirvana, the Nirvanic state. If one is a tired soul and wants to go beyond the conflict, beyond the capacities of the cosmic forces, then Nirvana is to be welcomed. Nirvana is the cessation of all earthly activities. This world is the playground of the dance of the cosmic forces, but when one enters into Nirvana, the cosmic forces yield to the ultimate highest Truth and there the Knower, the Known and the Knowledge or Wisdom are like three angels blended into one. At that time one becomes both the Knower and the Known.</p>
<p>If one does not have the experience of Nirvana, one usually cannot know what illusion is. According to some spiritual teachers, the world is Maya, an illusion. Then one enters into Nirvana one realises what illusion is. Nirvana is the static oneness with God. There, everything comes to an end in the static Bliss. This Bliss is unimaginable, unfathomable, indescribable. Beyond Nirvana is the state of Absolute Oneness. This oneness is the dynamic oneness with God.</p>
<p>Nirvana is a very, very, very, very high state. However it is not the highest state for the divine worker. If one wants to serve God here on earth, then he has to come back into the world again and again to serve the Supreme in humanity. If one wants to manifest the Supreme in the field of creation, then one has to work in the absolute dynamism of the Supreme and not rest in Nirvana. This does not mean that the divine worker cannot have the experience of Nirvana. The experience of Nirvana is at the command of all God-realised souls. But Nirvana is for those who want to be satisfied with the static aspect of the Brahman Supreme. If one wants to embody both the static and dynamic aspects of the Supreme, then I wish to say that one should go beyond Nirvana and enter into the field of manifestation.</p>

<p>Patience is not an unconditional surrender to universal suffering. No. Patience is the realisation of one's own unlimited Consciousness. Patience is the fruit of Eternity. God most effectively looks and sees through your Patience-Light. You try to see most soulfully through God's Compassion-Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Prana</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Prana" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Prana is a Sanskrit word meaning life-breath, life-force, life-energy. Prana is a cosmic Force or a cosmic Energy which operates in the physical body. Human life has a short span in which the prana lasts for forty, sixty or eighty years. But the cosmic Energy in its own sphere lasts for eternity. There is a connecting link between the cosmic Energy, which is infinite, and the prana, as this energy is called when it enters into our physical body. This link is the soul. The soul and the prana work together. It is the soul which calls the prana into the physical body for a short span of years. Then when it is God's Will, the connection breaks between the cosmic Energy and the prana enclosed in the physical frame. At that time we lose the body and die.</p>
<p>When we meditate, if we can become conscious of our breathing, it will help us to become conscious of the great divine Breath, of which we are the instruments. When we start to meditate, if the flow of prana is spontaneous, steady and unobstructed, then the inner being is in a position to bring forward the inner wealth and make the outer personality feel, fulfil and realise the Highest.Now how can we make the best use of this life-breath, this prana? It is through purity. The purer we can be in our inner and outer life, the easier it will be for the life-force to act in accordance with the Will of God. When prana becomes one with the cosmic will, immediately we see a great achievement, a grand achievement in our inner life. That achievement may come to us in the form of peace, in the form of joy or in the form of fulfilment. When prana, the life-force, is used in the service of the Supreme, we become the greatest pride of the Supreme.</p>
