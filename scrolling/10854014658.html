<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have not come here to bring about any social change. I have come to the West only to bring light, to be of service to you people, only to bring to the fore what is real in you so that you can become perfect instruments of God.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you are claiming unreality as your very own because you do not know the real from the unreal. When the real in you comes forward, then you become a perfect instrument of God. If the real comes to the fore in you, in him, in her, in everybody, then you will see some significant changes in society.</p>
<p>Society is like a house. If all the members of the house become perfect, then the house will flow with peace, light and harmony. It is from individual progress that the collective progress comes. If I become perfect, if you become perfect, if everybody becomes perfect, then you will see that the social changes will be unnecessary. But if we try to make society perfect when it is still full of imperfect human beings, we will sadly fail.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we do well in our studies and also be involved in meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we do well in our studies and also be involved in meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, I wish to tell you that I have quite a few university students who are doing extremely well in the spiritual life and, at the same time, they are doing very well in their studies.</p>
<p>If you want to do well in your studies, what you need at this stage is concentration. If you cannot concentrate well, you will not do well in your studies either. So spirituality is the answer. You have to know that what you get from your spiritual life is natural, normal, spontaneous and fulfilling. Early in the morning, if you can concentrate for ten minutes or even five minutes, then you will accomplish two things. You will feel boundless energy within you and you will simplify your life. These qualities will be a great help to you in your studies.</p>
<p>Spirituality you have to take as your private tutor. The private tutor teaches you at home and helps you to pass the examination. When you pray to God, when you concentrate and meditate on God, when you go deep within, at that time you are getting help and energy from your Source. Then it becomes infinitely easier to achieve success in your outer life. Spirituality will never stand in your way. Spirituality is not the negation of life; true spirituality is acceptance of the real life in us.</p>
<p>You spend eight or ten hours daily in order to get your degree, but this degree will only help you in making money or improving your social status. It won't help you to get inner peace or inner joy. You may be at the top of the class, but the strength of this achievement will last only for a fleeting hour and then you will feel a barren desert within you; there will be no satisfaction. The things that will give you permanent satisfaction are peace of mind and inner joy. And these things you can only get from meditation.</p>
<p>The outer knowledge and the inner knowledge must run abreast. But eventually the outer knowledge has to surrender its existence to the inner knowledge. When the inner knowledge takes full charge of the outer knowledge, then outer knowledge finds its real purpose and true fulfilment. Spirituality is the light-seed within you and this light you have to bring to the fore. Around you is tenebrous darkness, but if you can bring your inner light to the fore, then true knowledge can dawn in You.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your opinion about reading newspapers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your opinion about reading newspapers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters went to the length of saying that newspapers were nothing short of falsehood. I do not wish to go to that extreme. But if you are carried away by the news, then it becomes like a novel; there are so many things in the news that create sensation in you. After sensation will come irritation and many, many bad things will happen.</p>
<p>But again, you have to remain in the world. If you do not know that the President has died or if something very important takes place and you do not know about it, then you are not conscious of the world. You are not conscious of what is happening around you, and that is not good. But if you read the newspapers from the first page to the last page only for the sake of information, then you will remain in the world of information and illumination will not take place. So you have to be very careful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one way to deal with it. We have to feel that the world is not around us or in front of us, but deep within. It is not outside us; it is within us.</p>
<p>Then we have to try for our own nature's purification and transformation. The more we are purified and fulfilled inwardly, the sooner will world transformation take place. By telling someone, "Come here, you are imperfect. You have to become perfect," you will never make him perfect. But if you can purify your own emotion, if you can illumine your own inner life, then it will be infinitely easier for you to convince him to illumine his life. So we always say that aspirants have to go deep within to have their own inner illumination first. Then, when they have their own inner illumination, it becomes easier for them to give inspiration or dynamic energy or mounting aspiration to others and to illumine the rest of the world. We can illumine the world only through our own awakening and our own inner illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual here, unfortunately, is subject right now to suffering, sorrow and painful experiences. When an individual achieves liberation by virtue of his aspiration, Peace, Light and Bliss enter into him. At that time he is free from the world of suffering and excruciating pangs. Today he has become liberated; tomorrow he will inspire somebody else to come out of the net of suffering. Then the following day, he and the second person will inspire a third person. So someone has to start the game. You come out of the ignorance-sea, which is full of pain and suffering. Then your own illumination will inspire others to come out of the ignorance-sea.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In the spiritual life, are we supposed to feel responsible for other people or not?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In the spiritual life, are we supposed to feel responsible for other people or not?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on which plane you feel responsibility. When you breathe in, God alone knows how many tiny insects you destroy. If you have to think, "Oh God, I am destroying so many insects, so let me close my nose," then I tell you, this kind of responsibility will take you to the other world.</p>
<p>Clever people will say that there is no responsibility at all on earth. They say, "I didn't create the world. God created the world. So let God suffer; it is His business." Again, others will say, "God has created the world, that is true. But since God is an Old Man and we are young people, it is our bounden duty to help God."</p>
<p>But God says, "No. I am eternally young. I know what is best for Me and what is best for you. If you really care for Me, if you have such love for Me, then try to please Me in My own Way. I have created the world. You feel that although I have created the world, it has now gone out of My control, so you have come to help Me. But even if it has gone out of My control, which it hasn't — be kind to Me. Since I have created the world, don't try to become the manager or proprietor. Please just feel that since I have started this whole business, I am the employer and you are the employee. Don't reverse the game."</p>
<p>So God tells us to listen to Him and feel that we are employed by Him. If we are employed, then naturally our duty is to please the Boss in His own Way. This is our only responsibility. Once we accept the spiritual life, we have to feel at that time that God is our only responsibility. Even if we have wives and husbands, still we have to feel that God is our only responsibility. That does not mean that we will not love our husbands and wives, far from it. But we have to know why we are loving our husbands, why we are loving our wives, why we are loving our children. We are loving our dear ones just be cause inside them God is there. God may say to us, "Since you are here on earth, I am giving you a specific mission. You take care of your daughter. You take care of your son. You take care of your husband. That is your responsibility." Once we enter into the spiritual life, our only responsibility is obedience. There is no other responsibility. Obedience is our conscious oneness with our own highest part.</p>
<p>If God or your spiritual Master tells you that your only responsibility is to take care of your daughter, then you have to obey your Master. But if you say, "No! There was a special reason why I came into that family; my responsibility is also to my father, my mother, my sister," then this may be wrong. True, there was a special reason why you came into that family, but how do you know that reason has not already been fulfilled? Once you accept the spiritual life, at that time you have to feel that you have no mother, no father, no brother, no sister. When you come to the spiritual life, at that time your family has already played its role. In most of the cases, the parents have already played their role and the children have also played their role in such a way that the parents have actually got what they wanted from their children. Unconsciously the parents want their children to become good, kind and spiritual. The parents tried and the parents failed; they could not make the children good, kind and spiritual. But the children have done that themselves because they have entered into the spiritual life. So what the parents even unconsciously felt was their responsibility for their children, the children have done on their own. They have done the job infinitely better than the parents ever imagined was possible.</p>
<p>Once children accept the spiritual life, at that time their parents' responsibility is over. Then they become the Master's responsibility. Once you accept the spiritual life, at that time your responsibility is obedience to the Master or obedience to God, if you get the inner command. You may say, "Oh, my parents have taken care of me, paid for my university degree, done everything for me." That is true. But if you follow the spiritual life, you will realise God. At that time your soul, out of its infinite compassion, will give an iota of light to your parents. And even if you do not give consciously, unconsciously it will flow. This iota of light that you will give to your parents, who are not spiritual, is worth infinitely more than the thousands of dollars they have given you to study in the university. Thousands of students are coming out of Harvard and Yale every year with the highest degree. But out of the millions and billions of souls entering into the world each year, if even one realises God, then what happens? In India they say that when one person in a family realises God, then twelve generations from both sides-predecessors and successors- will all be liberated. When one realises God, compassion flows immediately: "He was the instrument, she was the instrument for my entrance into earth, so let me do something for them."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do you recommend vegetarianism? Is it related to purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do you recommend vegetarianism? Is it related to purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to lead a better life, a disciplined life, a pure life, I feel that a vegetarian diet is necessary. Those who eat meat, unconsciously are taking in the consciousness of an animal. In addition to their hostile and other undivine qualities, animals have tremendous restlessness. When we take in mild foods, our consciousness automatically becomes mild, soft and sweet. But when we eat meat, we take in the restless, destructive consciousness of animals.</p>
<p>All the time we are taking in the consciousness of other persons and objects. When we stand in front of a spiritual Master, immediately we take in his consciousness, his vibration. He is offering us what he has to give. Similarly, the animal offers us what it has to give; and what it has to give are its animal qualities. It is up to us to accept or reject these qualities. So for the beginner, or for anyone who is following the spiritual path, it is advisable to have a pure vegetarian diet. This helps considerably.</p>
<p>Purity is also necessary. One has to feel that purity does not come from merely washing the body ten times a day. Some people feel that if they take a shower six times a day they will be pure. Far from il! A fish is in the water twenty-four hours a day, yet the consciousness of a fish is not purer than that of any human. Cleanliness is next to godliness, true. We can take two or three showers a day, but to go on taking showers six or seven times in order to be pure is absolutely wrong. We can easily make the gross physical body pure if we install a living shrine inside our heart for the object of our adoration, who is God. We know that God exists, but where? Where can we see Him first? Inside our heart. God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, but that does not satisfy us. What satisfies us is that God is all love. And where is this love? It is inside our heart. We can establish purity within ourselves by feeling God's Presence inside our heart.</p>
<p>Then, if we really want to lead a better life, a disciplined life, and to have a pure character, we have to mix with those who have already established some purity in their outer lives. Every day a sincere seeker must associate with someone who is fairly advanced in the spiritual life. If the seeker has the opportunity to see his Master regularly, then the living presence of the Master will inundate his outer being with purity. It is not possible for the Master to be physically present everywhere, but if the seeker is sincere, if the seeker can have free access to the Master's heart on the strength of his own inner need, then the Master's divine consciousness can enter into the seeker's life every day and flood his life with purity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are trying to conquer ego or jealousy, immediately your inner will comes to the fore. Then you will have your best performance. When you practise sports, try to compete only with yourself. Do not think that you will come in first or you will come last. Your goal is progress; your goal is not to defeat someone else. If yesterday you threw the shotput seven metres, then today you will try to do a little better. But if you see that you are not making progress, then you have to surrender to God's Will. When you make constant surrender to God's Will, there cannot be any ego. So, in three successive ways you can make your surrender to God's Will complete.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important is outer knowledge on our path?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important is outer knowledge on our path?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your goal is God-realisation. The goal is like the top of a tree. When you get there, you will see around you millions of leaves, but nobody is going to ask if you see the leaves. The God-realisation that you have achieved is more than enough.</p>
<p>Whoever is studying world-information should ask himself, "Does it help me in God-realisation?" Absolutely not. Sri Ramakrishna did not have world information. He wrote his name with the greatest difficulty. His wife did not even go that far. His wife could not even write "God-realisation." She used to challenge Vivekananda because he could write.</p>
<p>But was Ramakrishna's manifestation inferior to others' manifestation? No. When it is a matter of manifestation, his identification with the Universal Consciousness was such that he got Vivekananda, Brahmananda and others to work as his instruments. If you realise the Highest, even if you are not a mental giant, no harm. If it is God's Will to manifest your light, He will bring you instruments who will be able to manifest your light. As an individual you have two arms and one mind. But when you attain God-realisation, at that time your mission can be inundated with thousands of arms and fertile brains. You need God; God needs you, so He is bound to give you what you need.</p>
<p>In India there is a famous saying about a particular sweetmeat. They say that he who has tasted it feels miserable, and he who has not tasted it also feels miserable. They say it about marriage. You are miserable if you have got it and if you have not tasted it you also feel miserable. In the spiritual life some who are still unripe and who are not ready to go to the Highest, hesitate on the way. While they are constantly moving in the spiritual life, they don't have time to think of what their previous life could have given them. But the moment they stop moving ahead and making progress, their time becomes occupied by past experiences. They begin to feel that they were not given the full opportunity in their former life to make all the progress that they could have made. They say, "We have lost everything that we had in the worldly life. We could have been well-established in the material life, but we gave it all up."</p>
<p>But when we enter the spiritual life we are in no way the loser. We have a goal and this goal gives us everything. Although the highest outer reality is lacking, we have to know that it is spirituality alone that holds the true highest Reality. There is nothing on earth that can give us the highest Reality. Earth-realities are based on information, but spiritual realities are based on inner awakening and revelation. Knowledge or information we can easily challenge, but we will not dare to challenge the reality founded on inner experience and realisation, because light is there right in front of us. How will we deny it?</p>
<p>When we live in the outer life, we possess something; in the inner life, we become something. The inner life always makes us feel what we are. The outer life, on rare occasions, makes us feel that we have something. But most of the time it does not even dare to say that we have something. When we remain in the inner world, the thing that we are seeking for, we eternally are. How will you deny it? But in the outer world we will deny our own life. We will say it is not meant for us; it is for somebody else.</p>
<p>So let us feel that we are actually the inner life. What we wanted to be in the outer life is all outer show and pretence. We are just trying to put things on ourselves and it becomes so difficult to get rid of them. Outer life is like an onion peel; the peel never ends. The inner life is like an orange; it is all orange. We just eat.</p>
