<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If some individuals get peace of mind by living in the countryside and leading a relaxed life, it is good for them. Others want to go through a more disciplined life. They feel that meditation is something very sacred; it is not something casual. For them it is advisable to meditate with utmost concentration in a meditation hall. Whether it is in the city or in the country is not important. Undoubtedly these people will make faster progress than those who just go into the countryside to enjoy the beauty and think good thoughts. But ultimately both the roads lead to the same destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly I give them only very general guidelines, because each individual's way of meditation is personal and unique. But out of God's infinite Bounty I have the capacity to teach their souls inwardly how to meditate. Each disciple of mine learns his own best way of meditation from his own soul. Also, I have written considerably on meditation and different inner techniques, so they can read my writings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. They can read some spiritual books for instruction and then start meditating at home. The best possible thing is to have a peaceful mind — not to allow any thoughts whatsoever to enter into the mind. But they will see that some thoughts are entering in spite of their best efforts, so they will have to make a selection and only allow the good thoughts to remain in the mind. The bad thoughts they will discard as soon as possible. By allowing only the good thoughts to remain, they will be able to get some peace of mind. Meditation means peace in the mind and bliss in the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Morning shows the day in most cases. In the morning, before we enter into the hustle and bustle of life, before we go out of our house and enter into the day's activities, if we meditate soulfully for a few minutes, then definitely we will get some inner peace. This peace we shall carry inside our hearts when we go to the office or enter into the multifarious activities and confusion of our daily life. Then we can bring to the fore this inner peace when we need it. In this way we will definitely be able to control the situation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is not so much difference as people think between Western and Eastern religion. We are all God's children. We speak in different languages, but when it is a matter of the heart — your heart, my heart, his heart, her heart — we are all in tune. It is only the mind that creates problems. The aspiring heart is constantly in communication with the soul, and the soul is the representative of God. There is always an abiding truth inside all of us. When it is a matter of real spirituality, there is no geographical barrier — no East, no West, no North, no South. There is only the heart's oneness. It is through our heart's oneness that we fulfil ourselves and fulfil God in and through us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have not necessarily turned away from God, only they understand God according to their limited capacities. But a true seeker will not condemn them. On the contrary, he will try to see and feel that the mistakes committed by them are his own mistakes because he has accepted God totally. This acceptance of God includes the acceptance of God's entire creation, and these people who are making mistakes are also God's children. So the sincere aspirant feels that it is obligatory on his part to consider the weaknesses, the failures and the shortcomings of others as his own. Because he loves God, he feels that he has to be identified with God's creation. He cannot negate God's creation; he cannot speak ill of God's creation. He can only accept God's creation as such and pray and meditate on God to illumine His creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He will get more understanding, more illumination. He will be able to accept the world rather than negate the world, for the world is God's creation, and Creator and creation always go together. If we accept them together, then we will be able to fulfil the Supreme Reality within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oh, no. In my case I am fortunate enough to be able to tell you that my students have taken spirituality and meditation very seriously. Of course, some people do leave. But in comparison to the number that have come, very few people have left. Meditation is not something that becomes boring after a few years. But because people have their set ways of thinking or because they have personal problems or vital problems, they may leave. They come to feel that this way of meditation is not suitable for them anymore, but not because meditation was just a fad for them. They took meditation seriously. But many thoughts, many desires, many fantasies, many idiosyncrasies may come in, and they feel that the path is not suitable anymore. So they leave.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sri Chinmoy, you've had a number of musicians as your students. People in our audience would be interested in knowing why you think musicians who were so involved in what might be considered the material life — drugs and things like that — may seek a Guru.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The answer is very simple. The things that they did before did not help them find the true divinity within themselves. They did not find what they were looking for, so they wanted to find a spiritual Master to help them.</p>

<p><em>Caller:</em> I am particularly interested in astral Projection. I had an experience three years ago, where I left my body. I had just read about this some time before that, but I didn't do it consciously. It just happened to me. Since then I have been trying to do it consciously. I would like to ask Sri Chinmoy if this is safe. Is it a safe thing to go into by myself?</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Interesting question. Astral projection, leaving the body. Can people actually do this?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People can do this, but it is advisable to have a teacher who is well qualified in this adventure. Otherwise, it can be a very dangerous thing. It is like learning to drive a car. One needs a teacher in the beginning. If someone tries to learn driving by himself, he is very likely to have an accident.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> What can a teacher teach one about leaving the body?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything can be taught by a qualified teacher. If one can learn a language from a teacher, if one can learn music, if one can learn to dance, one can learn this also.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is something called mental music, something called vital music and something called physical music. But again, there is something called psychic music. If one wants to get true delight from the heart and from the aspiring life, then he must dedicate his music to God. He must play soulful, psychic music — music that will inspire his own life of aspiration and inspire others who hear his music — not music that will excite the vital and arouse the physical consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say, more about satisfaction, light and delight. There may be great musicians who do not believe in God, but they do believe in satisfaction, joy, delight. If you play divine music, spiritual music, then you are bound to give and get satisfaction.</p>
<p>Caller: I'd like to know how much discipline is required to master meditation.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All the discipline that one can muster in one's own life. Discipline is a continuous process. In this process we make progress. It depends on how sincerely the individual has accepted the spiritual life. If he wants to become perfect, then he has to discipline not only his body, vital and mind but also his entire life, totally. But if he wants to derive only a little satisfaction from life, a little bit of peace from life, then he does not have to go through this total self discipline. It entirely depends on how much the seeker needs from his inner life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He has to be very careful in every way, beginning with the mind. He has to feel that his mind is a room that has a few doors and windows which will let the whole world inside. The seeker has to close the doors and windows and stand at a particular door. Then he must allow inside only the thoughts and ideas that are going to help him in his spiritual life. Purity, peace, harmony, and so on — these are his friends. So he will allow them to enter into his mind-room and he will converse only with them. This is how the individual can practise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Donna Halper: Does a person have to go away somewhere? Does he have to go to an ashram or a synagogue in order to be successful at meditating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Donna Halper:&lt;/em&gt; Does a person have to go away somewhere? Does he have to go to an ashram or a synagogue in order to be successful at meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary to go anywhere. Meditation entirely depends on one's inner sincerity. There are many people who have been to ashrams and monasteries, and there they could not conquer their mind's wrong thoughts. If you remain in a closed room, that does not mean you will have no thoughts about the outside world. It is advisable for a seeker to meditate at a certain place at a specific time, but meditation does not require a life of seclusion.</p>
