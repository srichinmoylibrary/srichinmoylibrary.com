  <h2 id="page-title">Inner blessings</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Inner blessings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was an Indian girl, Vijaya, who worked in the same section with me. She came from South India, from Kerala, our divine Shivaram’s place. She was very nice and kind to me, very fond of me. Some time after I left the Consulate, she left her position and got married. When she had a child, she wanted me to bless it because, according to her, I was a real swami, a real saint. A few years ago, she brought her child to my house for blessings. She said, “Look, we were in the same section and now you have become a saint, a swami.” She was very proud that I was an Indian. She was very nice, and I blessed the child.</p>
<p>In 1981, when I was giving some lectures and concerts in Canada, Vijaya happened to be in Toronto. She wanted to come and see me, but she could not come because of family problems. Her husband also likes me very much.</p>
<p>In India, whenever you see a swami, a spiritual man, you give him something. So she put fifty dollars in an envelope and wrote, “For the Swami.” She gave the money to Shivaram to give to me so that she could get inner blessings for her family and for herself.</p>
<p>Even in those days, when I was a junior clerk and she was a junior clerk, she saw something in me.</p>

<p>I had another friend at the Consulate whose name was Kapoor. He was a friend and also a great admirer of mine. He left the Consulate and worked at an airline. Then he went to Oakland, California. Every Saturday, in the evening, he used to call me from Oakland to chat with me and get a little bit of advice about how to have more peace with his wife and children.</p>

<p>A few years ago, when I went to Marine Midland Bank, a little black boy, three or four years old, came up to me and grabbed me. He said, “Kaku, kaku!” Now ‘Kaku’ means ‘uncle’ in Indian language. So I said to myself, “What is this? How can I be his uncle?”</p>
<p>O my God, then he ran to his father who was standing ten metres away and I saw that this man was one of my colleagues at the Indian Consulate, Mr. Macwan. He is a Gujarati. I asked him, “When did you get married?” Then he told me all about his wife. “She is so good, who cares for colour?” he said.</p>
<p>He sent his little boy to call me, “Uncle, uncle!”</p>

<p>Another colleague was so kind to me. His name was Vincent Jovial. He wanted to become a priest. Once he took me to see his uncle who was a priest and his uncle tried to convert me. Unfortunately, this priest was a rogue. A few weeks later, he issued many, many false checks. Then jail invited him! He had wanted to publish my book on Tagore. Luckily, I got it back.</p>
<p>So that priest was no good. Then Jovial took me to another priest. Priests are not allowed to marry, but this priest was married. I told my friend that we should call him a minister, but my friend replied that Indian priests can get married.</p>
<p>One Sunday I was invited to give a talk in this priest’s apartment. Around thirty people were there. I spoke for about an hour and a half. Afterwards, one Indian lady came and fell flat at my feet. She had been planning to go back to India because nobody was nice to her. She told me that during my talk she had received so much joy, love and affection from Mother India. She saw India inside me. Then she said, “Now I do not need to go back to India anymore.” I saved her the trip.</p>
<p>That was my first private talk.</p>

<p>In Shivaram’s section, Accounts, there was a Gujarati named Ashok Choksi. He was the one who prepared our paychecks. His sister used to be Mr. Mehrotra’s first secretary, but she left before I joined. Then she opened up a restaurant in San Francisco. It is called “Malvi.”</p>
<p>I went there to see her once. The restaurant was supposed to open at five-thirty. But I was there one hour earlier. She was so nice. She opened the restaurant for me and she herself served me. Then, when I wanted to pay her, she said, “No money, no money!”</p>

<p>“But I have no followers,” I said.</p>

<p>In 1964, when I was working at the Indian Consulate, one of my friends came to our section and said that Jacqueline Kennedy was at a small gallery nearby. Hardly 30 or 40 people were there to see her. From the Consulate many workers went running to see her, but I did not go. Why? I had the highest admiration for her, but I disliked those drawings. I had seen them before and I thought they were silly, so I did not go. If she had been somewhere else, I would have gone.</p>
<p>Now I laugh. How easily I could have seen her at that gallery the way my colleagues did. I lost my opportunity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A special friend</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A special friend" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In 1977 I had to go to the Indian Consulate to take care of my passport. I went to the counter. All of a sudden, someone came out of the elevator and started screaming, “O God!” It was difficult for me to recognise him at first, but then I remembered that he was one of my former colleagues. He was so delighted to see me. He placed his hand on my shoulder and then he measured my waistline. “You have gone high in height, and here also you have grown!”</p>
<p>I said, “I have to go both ways. I have to be integral!”</p>
<p>Like this, we were cutting jokes with each other. He was so moved to see me and talk to me. He had read some of my books and he had heard so much about me. A few years earlier, he had gone to Hunter College to attend one of our functions. When he saw so many people and guards, he was frightened to death. He told me, “I wanted to go and embrace you. You were in front of the public, and then I saw that you had kept strong people there to be your guards. I was frightened. I am your friend who used to chat with you for hours, but now that you have become a big shot, how am I going to approach you?”</p>
<p>Then he asked me why I was there. I told him that I had come for a new passport. He immediately went and started questioning the clerk. The clerk said that it would take three days. Then my friend had to say to him, “Do you know who he is? He used to work in our section. You cannot do him a favour?”</p>
<p>Then my friend started shouting and screaming. He has now become Assistant Director in their Commercial Section. The clerk said, “I do not dare to go to the Consul for his signature. Tomorrow we can go.”</p>
<p>When he heard this, my friend just took the passport and the papers and went to the Consul’s office. He did not even knock. He opened the door to the office and immediately went inside. In a minute, he got the papers signed. This is what friendship can do. Then, as I was leaving, he said to me, “I am so happy, Ghose, that I saw you.”</p>
<p>This friend is very fond of me. He really values me. If he had not recognised me, God knows how many hours I would have had to wait there on that day!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">You carry two worlds</h2><span property="dc:title" content="You carry two worlds" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In 1984 I gave a Peace Concert in Toronto. There I met with Krishan Chandra, who succeeded Mr. Mukherjee as our Section Officer at the Consulate. Before that he was the assistant boss in our section. As I came off the stage, somebody came from behind me and fell at my feet, saying, “I recognise you!”</p>
<p>I said, “I, too, recognise you! What are you doing? You are my boss!”</p>
<p>Then Chandra said, “Inwardly I am not your boss. Ghose, we knew it, we knew it while you were working with us. We knew you were not just a clerk. Your very name is a phenomenon. You carry two worlds inside you — Eastern and Western. It is such a rare thing. Your music has transported my wife and me almost into a trance. Please let us know when you are coming again so we can be with you and be blessed by you.”</p>
<p>I thanked him and said, “I am so grateful to you. Your very presence is a blessing to me and to us all.”</p>
<p>This particular man was much older than me and he used to be my boss. Even then, he had to touch my feet in front of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>When the British girls performed my play about Lord Krishna in Toronto in 1995, he came to see it.</p>
<p>How people can be so nice to me! At the Indian Consulate, the people who worked with me were so kind to me.</p>

<p>In August 1996 a lady happened to see a poster about me in Manhattan. She came to the function and asked one of the disciples, “Is that the same Chinmoy who used to work at the Indian Consulate?” Then she said that she had been a secretary at the Consulate at the same time. At first I could not recognise her, but as soon as she said her name I remembered her. I always used to see her carrying tea and coffee for her bosses. Her name is Marjorie Johnson and she is from Jamaica, West Indies. She was the secretary of Nirmaljit Singh in the Information Section. She told my disciple, “Chinmoy was always inwardly what he is today.”</p>
<p><em>Marjorie Johnson: Chinmoy was always so peaceful. You felt such peace emanating from him and he often used to sing while he worked. To me, he personified goodness. I saw that he was beyond the ordinary and I knew then that he was going to make an impact on people’s lives. Gurus are born, not made. He is a real Guru in India’s highest tradition.</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My letter of resignation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My letter of resignation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>June 13th, 1967<br /><br /> My Dear Mr. Mukherjee,</p>
<p>I beg to offer my resignation with all my heart’s deepest gratitude to each member of the Passport and Visa section and my Consul, Mr. Nazareth, and the Adm. Consul, Mr. Bhalla, and finally to the Consul General, Dr. Gupta, who have all been most kind and affectionate to me during my humble service at the Indian Consulate.</p>
<p>My deepest sense of gratitude also flies to Moscow to my ex-Consul, Mr. Mehrotra, who had so kindly appointed me. He was of abundant help and inspiration to me. His constant and genuine concern for me makes me shed tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, I shall never forget our Consul General Dr. Gupta’s indulgent ear. I shall always treasure his sweet, encouraging and inspiring words.</p>
<p>Consul Bhalla has been most sympathetic and most actively interested in my future plans, and for that I am deeply indebted to him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to serve my Consul Mr. Nazareth for a long period of time. Nevertheless, during this short span of time, his dynamic inspiration and profound understanding have touched my heart deeply.</p>
<p>Mr. Chandra’s penetrating mind and true concern have greatly helped me, and to him I sincerely owe a great deal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Coutinhoe, Mr. Jovial, Mr. Takore, Miss Ramaswamy, Mr. Jesia, Mrs. Chipper and Mrs. Chopra—to each of them please tender my deep affection, joy and gratitude.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Mukherjee, in all sincerity, I would like to tell you how I wished and still wish to be worthy of your unfathomable affection.</p>
<p>Most sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Chinmoy Kumar Ghose</p>
<p><em>“Mr. Chinmoy Kumar Ghose has performed his responsibilities with an unflinching sense of duty, an unquestionable integrity and thorough sincerity. We wish him every success in his endeavours to spread India’s message of Truth and Love and spiritual disciplines such as Yoga.”</em></p>

<p><em>“How is Ghose? He was a little unwell during the days preceding my departure. I am very much concerned and would expect him to take greater care of his physical well-being; for I know he has already taken care of his spiritual well-being better than any one of us.”</em></p>
<p><em>-– L. L. Mehrotra, First Secretary, Indian Embassy in Moscow</em><br /><em>(formerly Consul, Indian Consulate, New York)</em><br /><em>taken from one of his letters,</em><br /><em>28 January 1967</em></p>
<p><em>“I have rarely seen such an industrious and honest person. Moreover, he is a gentleman in its true sense. He is an unassuming and humble person with great strength of character. I shall greatly miss him, both officially and personally.”</em></p>
<p><em>–- A. K. Mukherjee, Assistant to Consul, Indian Consulate</em><br /><em>New York, 9 June 1967 </em></p>

<h2>Dire poverty</h2>

<p>After getting a job at the Indian Consulate, I took a small room on 108th Street, near Columbia University. I think I paid $45 a month for my room. Two other workers from the Consulate shared the apartment. The others had big rooms, but mine was so small that if I had been one foot taller, or even less than one foot, then I would have touched from wall to wall when I was lying down! There was a long corridor and my room was at the end. There were cockroaches everywhere. It was so bad, so bad!</p>
<p>At night my meal was two cupcakes and water. Then, in the morning, I used to take cereal without milk. Sometimes at night, around eleven o’clock, I used to go out and sit in a small park nearby. It is called Morningside Park. My friends used to say, “Do not go there. It is so dangerous. At night all kinds of drug addicts and bad characters come out.” I went there only to meditate. I was in my own world.</p>
<p>One night an old lady was making such a noise. I did not know if she was laughing or crying. I did not dare to go near her.</p>
<p>It was in this park that I wrote my famous poems “I am a Thief,” “I am a Fool” and “I am an Idiot.”</p>
<p><em>Harshad Acharya: During the four months that I shared an apartment with Sri Chinmoy, I do not remember ever seeing him in the kitchen. I do not know what he lived on. I think it was mostly fruit. I used to see his light on very late at night. He used to stay up writing poems.</em></p>

<p>After the apartment on 108th Street I went to another place and, a few months later, I moved to an apartment on West 76th Street. It was near the American Museum of Natural History. From there it was only a short walk across Central Park to the Consulate. While going to work in the morning, I used to walk fast, jog or run. It used to take me only five minutes. It was in this apartment that I wrote many poems.</p>
<p>My landlady was German. She used to tell me, “You will not like America. I can see that your lifestyle is very simple. You are not modern. Here, everybody is modern.”</p>
<p>One day I was about to go to the Museum of Natural History to look at the exhibits. Five minutes before I arrived, a man was shot and killed. I heard the sound even!</p>
<p><em>Bholanath: One morning I got a telephone call from Guru to come and help him move. At that time I had a job delivering carpets, so I drove my truck to his place. He did not have many things — just a mattress, a few boxes of books and some bricks and pieces of wood that he used to make a bookcase. I had some rope in the truck, so I tied it around each box and lowered them out the window. Guru waited on the street below to untie the boxes and put them in the truck. He thought this was very ingenious.</em></p>

<p>In 1965 I moved to New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. This apartment was quite good. I made progress; this time I think I paid $70 a month rent. Downstairs there was a flower shop and across the street was the printing shop where I used to go and scream at the printer, who was my very dear friend.</p>
<p>The train used to pass only two or three metres away from this apartment. Not across the street! It went right by the side of the building. Such a noise it made!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Saved by my Mother Kali</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Saved by my Mother Kali" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One evening at our Brooklyn apartment, somebody left the candles burning on the shrine by mistake after the Centre meditation was over. I was in my own room and suddenly I saw smoke entering. I ran into the meditation room. By that time the fire was very serious. The whole place was ablaze. The curtains were completely burnt and the flames had reached the top of the shrine.</p>
<p>I went outside the room and stood on the roof. The distance between the place where I stood and Mother Kali’s picture was only thirty feet or so. From there I uttered the name of the Supreme three times very loudly from my inmost consciousness.</p>
<p>Then a miraculous thing happened. When I chanted “Supreme” three times, the fire calmed down like an obedient child. Although the fire had reached my Mother Kali’s picture, the picture itself was not burnt. But the glass was shattered and the picture frame and the cardboard behind the picture were reduced to ashes. X was searching for water, but she could not find the kitchen because there was so much smoke.</p>
<p>Then the fire brigade arrived and covered everything with water. They also began throwing things out of the window. So many things were destroyed. They caused so much damage.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the morning, when it was all over, I saw my Mother Kali vividly with my naked eyes. She was dancing. She said, “Let the house be burned to ashes, but I have saved my children!”</p>
<p>My Mother Kali is my dearest, she is my everything. She is the protector. Thousands and millions of times she has saved me. It is her Feet that can give us our liberation and our salvation sooner than at once. Immediately she can give us everything that God possesses.</p>
<p>Many years later, Mahavishnu made the throne in my meditation room and he put that picture of Mother Kali on top of the throne. If you look closely, you can see that it is singed around the edges.</p>
