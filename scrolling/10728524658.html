<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, do I have any liberated souls among my disciples? I want my disciples to meditate here and then to go and work divinely. Aspire and manifest. They both go together. While you are manifesting, you are aspiring; manifestation itself is a form of aspiration. You cannot separate manifestation from aspiration. While you are manifesting anything, you are aspiring for further knowledge, for further light, for further wisdom.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sri Ramakrishna did not stay on earth for a long time. He was given limited time. Had he stayed on earth for eight more years, he could have developed somebody else into Vivekananda’s calibre, if he wanted to. But he knew his time limit. Even those who came to him, came only toward the end of his life. They got hardly six or seven years to meditate with him before he left. Even his closest disciples, those who were among that small group, were with him for a very short time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But when he himself came, he still had to realise God. He still had to turn a few pages. I was realised in a previous incarnation. Yet I had to work so many years to revise the book, especially during the first three or four years. Twenty years it took me to completely revise that particular book of God-realisation. It takes many years. Ramakrishna was a liberated soul in his previous incarnation. But for him to realise Mother Kali took many years. He did not realise Kali all of a sudden. But once he realised God, then in the two other forms — the Muslim form and the Christian form — he again realised God very easily.</p>
<p>But when it is a matter of getting someone for manifestation on earth, it is really difficult. To get someone like Vivekananda is most difficult. If Vivekananda had not come to the West, who would have manifested Ramakrishna? Nobody! Realisation itself is so difficult, but Ramakrishna did it. He was the body; but for manifestation we also need arms and legs. It is like a tree; just a trunk is not enough. The branches are also necessary. If there are no branches, then nobody will call it a tree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He had confidence that he would find them. Ramakrishna was so strict in accepting disciples. First he used to see occultly, then he used to read the palm and the forehead, and then he used to look into their eyes. He used to accept disciples only after examining them in so many ways. He was not satisfied with seeing only their souls. I scold my disciples when they enjoy ignorance, but I don’t insult them in public. Ramakrishna used to insult people in front of everyone.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Divine Grace can do everything. But at the same time ignorance is also powerful. Divine Grace is omnipotent, but if one consciously likes ignorance, then the Grace does not force anyone. Smoking is very bad. Suppose someone consciously wants to smoke for a few days. He says that after such and such a date he will give up smoking. But he does not know what may happen during that period. That date may be tomorrow or it may be twenty years later. Then, during those twenty years all his divine possibilities may be lost. In India there are many people who say that spirituality is not meant for them right now. They say: “First let us enjoy the world. After we have lived a long life, then we will meditate.” But long before they are ready to meditate, perhaps they will pass away. In this way ignorance captures us. Then the divine Grace just says, “All right. If he cares so much for ignorance, let him enjoy it.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You see in the resurrection of the Christ that death is not the end. In India also, many spiritual Masters have proved to their dear ones that death is not the end. They have appeared to them in a vivid subtle body. Just one example I will give you. There was a great spiritual Master in India named Sri Ramakrishna. When he left his body, his wife became a widow. In India, when the husband dies, the wife has to take off her bangles and jewels. While Sri Ramakrishna’s wife was doing that, her husband appeared before her so vividly and said to her, “What are you doing? You should not take off these bangles and jewellery. On the contrary, from now on you should wear all golden bracelets and jewellery. Now I have become immortal. Therefore, you should use something more beautiful, more meaningful and fruitful.” There are many, many instances like that, only perhaps they are not recorded.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You once told us that there was a man who failed to realise God at the last moment because his Guru did not help him overcome his doubt.

If the man’s Guru had been powerful enough, could the Guru have helped the man at that point?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Guru was powerful enough. He was alive at that time, but unfortunately the man had had a quarrel with his Guru. The Guru was angry with him; so the Guru did not help him. But he could have done it. If that seeker had not quarrelled with his Guru, he would definitely have realised God.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna gave everything to Vivekananda, but after the Master had left the body, Vivekananda wanted to go to Pahari Baba so many times for further initiation. Ramakrishna, the great Avatar, had initiated him and given everything to him, and then Vivekananda wanted to go to Pahari Baba to get further initiation. So this is how doubt can assail even a great seeker like Vivekananda. After Sri Ramakrishna’s death, Vivekananda went fifteen or sixteen times to Pahari Baba while making up his mind about getting initiation from him. Then finally Ramakrishna appeared to him with a sorrowful face and said, “Don’t go, don’t go.”</p>
<p>Vivekananda’s disciples will say that he had a big heart and he wanted to work for humanity, but he needed better health. That is why he wanted to go to an occultist like Pahari Baba. But real seekers will simply say that if Ramakrishna had wanted him to work on earth for the earth-consciousness, would not Ramakrishna have cured him of his illness? This kind of sickness is nothing for a spiritual figure like Ramakrishna to cure, if he wants to. Vivekananda’s time had come; he had played his role.</p>
<p>Krishna was a great Avatar. But a hunter’s arrow struck him and killed him. But in the Kurukshetra battle, how many weapons the Kauravas used to try to kill Krishna. He was killing everybody with his Sudarshana, his golden disc. He had the power to avoid death if he wanted to. But Krishna knew that he was just playing a game. When his role was over, he allowed the hunter’s arrow to kill him.</p>
<p>Vivekananda was also a spiritual hero. He had finished his role, but his vital wanted to stay on earth, so he went to Pahari Baba even while Sarada Devi was still alive. Even Vivekananda suffered from tremendous doubt. At the last moment, while Ramakrishna was leaving the body, Vivekananda was still doubting him. Then Ramakrishna had to say, “He who is Rama, he who is Krishna, in one form is Ramakrishna.” At that moment and many previous times also, Ramakrishna gave Vivekananda so many higher experiences. He got everything from Ramakrishna. When Vivekananda’s devotion came to the fore, he said that from a grain of sand Sri Ramakrishna could make thousands of Vivekanandas. If he had maintained that kind of faith he would never have gone to Pahari Baba, who was infinitely inferior to Sri Ramakrishna. But this is what doubt can do. Doubt can capture even a hero like Vivekananda. Doubt has the power to turn a lion into a house cat.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The great souls, liberated souls, realised souls, the earth-saviours, come into this world for world-transformation, but it is practically in vain. They come here, but they can hardly achieve anything. It was Vivekananda who brought Indian spirituality to the West. It lasted, but it would have lasted longer if so many Hatha Yoga teachers had not come to the West. On the one hand, you can say that Westerners, since they were not very spiritual to begin with, did the right thing by starting with Hatha Yoga, which is like kindergarten. There is a great difference between Hatha Yoga exercises and ordinary physical exercises, and there is a great advantage in doing Hatha Yoga. But on the other hand, if they had started with the yoga of concentration and meditation right from the beginning, as the Indians do, they would have made much faster progress. There are many ashrams in India where they do not practise Hatha Yoga at all. They do not give any importance to Hatha Yoga there. In the same way, they could have started with real meditation in America.</p>
<p>But a great number of swamis came here after Vivekananda and started teaching Hatha Yoga. They ignored meditation and the inner life, so Westerners associated Yoga with only physical exercises. Vivekananda’s Vedanta movement was thwarted by Hatha Yoga here. Again, there were some in America who cared for deeper spirituality. Then the Hatha Yoga teachers, who perhaps never meditated in India, became clever. They attached meditation to their own teachings so that they could keep at least some disciples.</p>
<p>But when it is a matter of meditation, I wish to say that many of my own disciples have meditated for a longer period and more sincerely than some of these swamis did in India. They may have stayed there for thirty, forty or even fifty years, but out of those forty or fifty years perhaps they did not meditate seriously for even one month. Some of these teachers did not have a spiritual Master at all, while others went to a spiritual figure for a very short time. Then they came to the West and banked on their Master’s name. They said, “I had so-and-so as my Master.” But some of these so-called disciples did not even stay at the Master’s ashram. Or they may have stayed at the ashram for a day or a month. When the Masters were alive, perhaps these swamis were their worst disciples. The Masters may never even have known that these disciples were with them. But then these so-called disciples became the self-styled “chosen instruments” of their Master in the West.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are your views on reincarnation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are your views on reincarnation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Reincarnation is necessary for ordinary human beings, but not for God-realised souls. But if it is the Supreme’s Will that I take another incarnation, then I will have to come down. Otherwise, a God-realised soul can stay always in the highest Bliss. But the highest kind of Bliss is also this: to serve the Supreme and humanity. The Buddha did not care for this kind of service. He advised his followers to stay in Nirvana. There are already hundreds of souls who have entered into Nirvana and who are not coming down again. They Feel that the world has given them enough bad experiences. They are more than satisfied with these and they do not want to come back. So those who follow the strict path of the Lord Buddha and achieve their highest Goal are not for reincarnation. They will not come back into the world and will not accept any more suffering from the world.</p>
<p>The Buddha wanted to remain always in perfect Bliss. He did not care for the transformation of the physical nature. He felt that once you can escape from the cycle of human suffering, you should stay in Bliss. But the Hindu philosophy says that you should work to transform the suffering of humanity. The Buddha had a heart larger than the universe. He cried for the end of human suffering, but his wisdom took him to another road. If you follow that road, you do not come back into the world once you have attained liberation.</p>
<p>There is another Nirvana which is higher than the Nirvana that the Buddha realised. In his later years the Buddha once said that he did not want to have the highest Nirvana until all human beings were liberated. But then he entered into his own Nirvana and he did not come back to earth.</p>
<p>According to the great Indian spiritual Masters, the Buddha was the most perfect man that Mother Earth possessed. Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and many others said that the Buddha was the most perfect man on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Buddha did not use the term “soul,” but he did say that there is an inner being, an inner existence. He said that it is our inner existence which is eventually freed from the fetters of ignorance. We are all in ignorance, but there is an inner subtle existence which he never called “the soul.” He used the term “inner being,” or “inner existence,” which cannot be affected by disease, decay or death. This was his term.</p>

<h2>Question: Was Lord Krishna’s <em>Rasalila</em>, or nectar-love play, with the gopis sheer imagination?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The surrendered seeker’s realisation of the Love infinite is called <em>Rasalila</em>. This play is humanity’s salvation and Divinity’s Compassion.</p>

Did they realise God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you tell us about the souls of Ramanuja, Shankara and Madhava? Did they realise God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They were all intellectual giants. At the same time, they had great aspiration. Some people are of the opinion that Shankara was an incarnation of the Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is a great spiritual Being; he is one of the gods in our Hindu Trinity. But in terms of realisation, Shankara cannot be placed on the same footing as a real spiritual Master or a Yogi. According to some spiritual giants, he was not a God-realised soul. And Ramanuja and Madhava were far below him. But all of them spoke on Vedanta philosophy, and they actually established three different paths. Ultimately, these three paths have only one aim. When we enter into each path, we feel that at the end of the journey, they reach the same goal.</p>
<p>Shankara lived in the eighth century A.D. Today in India, Shankhara is considered as a saint, a spiritual giant, but it is not absolutely correct. Realised souls are in a different category. And Madhava and Ramanuja were far from God-realisation in the strict sense of the term.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you tell us something about Sri Aurobindo?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you tell us something about Sri Aurobindo?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to know about Sri Aurobindo, I would advise you to read his books, especially <em>The Life Divine</em>. <em>The Life Divine</em> is about his own life, his own realisation, his own manifestation. His disciples have also written many books on him but the books that he has written himself are infinitely better than all the books written by his disciples put together. If you read <em>The Life Divine</em>, you will know the message, the unique message, which Sri Aurobindo brought down into the earth-consciousness. <em>The Life Divine</em> is his highest realisation and his divine manifestation. This book says everything.</p>
<p>There are many genuine spiritual Masters who have not written anything. In his case, the world is extremely fortunate that he offered his infinite inner wisdom-light through his writings. One may not want to read all his books, but one book is enough. If you read <em>Thee Divine</em>, you will feel what he is and what he has to offer. But again, what he is, is infinitely superior to his book, to any book or to all the books put together. But whatever the world could receive from his writings he offered through that book. So if you want to know more about Sri Aurobindo, I advise you to read this supremely unparalleled book.</p>
