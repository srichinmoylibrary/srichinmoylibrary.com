  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak on Grace?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak on Grace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has various kinds of power, but His most powerful adamantine power is His Grace. The moment He uses His Grace for a seeker, He offers His very Life-Breath to the seeker.</p>
<p>God and God's Grace can never be separated. The divine Grace is constantly descending upon us. He who is aspiring sincerely is consciously aware of this divine Grace, whereas he who is not aspiring is keeping his heart's door permanently closed to the divine Grace.</p>
<p>If we approach God through His Grace, then we are more successful. When we think of God, if we immediately feel that God is Grace within and without, then we will find it easier to approach God. The moment we think of God's Grace, we feel that His infinite Peace, Light and Bliss are already in the process of entering into us. But if we think of God as omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent, then His divine qualities we do not see flowing through us. When we think of God as Grace, then all His divine, infinite qualities we feel entering into us. At that time, they become part and parcel of our inner and outer life.</p>
<p>From now on, let us feel that it is through the Grace of God that we can go to God, not that by going to God we are going to have His Grace. Here is a subtle difference. Let us think of God's Grace, which is constantly flowing, and let the flow carry us into the Source.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know what patience is, then it is very easy for you to have more of it. If you feel that a particular thing requires a certain length of time, then you will become impatient when the time is up. You have set a time limit: in two days or in two weeks or in four months you have to realise God. After that time, if God is still hiding from you, if God-realisation still remains a far cry, then you become impatient.</p>
<p>You have to feel that you don't have to set a time for your self-mastery. You should say, "I shall realise God at his choice hour." Your part is to pray and meditate and not to fix a date. God has not asked you to set a time for Him to come and visit you. Let the time be taken care of by God Himself. You be responsible only for your prayer and meditation; let God be responsible for the Hour. Each one can take care of his own business. Prayer belongs to you, but the time belongs to the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, patience is always necessary. But we have to know the difference between patience and tolerance. Sometimes we think that surrendered tolerance is patience, but this is wrong. We have tolerance only because we feel that there is no other way for us, but this tolerance is not patience at all. No, real patience has to be utilised in the form of wisdom. Real patience is oneness. Real patience will wait for Eternity while the individual progresses. But if it is only tolerance that is trying to take the role of patience, then there will be no real satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the spiritual significance of balance?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the spiritual significance of balance?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life balance is of paramount importance. When the result of an action elevates our consciousness, we feel that we are running towards our destined Goal. When our inner mounting cry takes us to the loftiest heights, our whole being becomes a sea of delight. But when we don't have outer success, it doesn't mean that we are not running toward the Highest. Sometimes defeat is a blessing in disguise. Defeat can be a reality which is secretly preparing us to run the fastest. When undivine thoughts fill our mind, we have to know that they are like passing clouds which will soon disappear. Then our soul will again come to the fore. If we have perfect balance and do not become sad or depressed, at that time we make the fastest progress. We need equanimity of mind in order to make the heart receptive. We need perfect balance in order to achieve real satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does &quot;destruction&quot; mean in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does &amp;quot;destruction&amp;quot; mean in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life, nothing is totally destroyed for good. If you feel destruction means that something is gone forever and that never again will you see its face, then you are mistaken. From the spiritual point of view, you have to know that destruction is the transformation of the limited consciousness. It is like this. When you move from one year into the next year, you do not see the old year anymore. The old year you do not see either in your outer life or in your inner life. What you see is the outer and inner transformation of the year that has just passed.</p>
<p>Take a particular desire that you may have had as a child. Now that desire is no longer in you or around you. At the age of seven, let us say, you wanted to be the greatest poet on earth. Now you are fifty years old and you are not a celebrated poet; far from it. You have not become even an ordinary poet. But this does not disturb you in the least, because you have entered into the spiritual life and that old desire has been "destroyed." That desire operated in you before, but now you want only to enter into the life of infinite Truth. Your desire-bubble has burst; it is totally gone. What has actually happened is that it has been transformed into aspiration. This aspiration wants to achieve the Highest and grow into the infinite Light, Peace, Bliss and Power of God. If you look for your old desire with your physical eyes, then you will see that it is nowhere to be found. The desire which you cherished at the age of seven has been totally destroyed by the illumining light inside you. The illumining light has given you the flame of aspiration. Or you can say that God's Grace has entered into your present-day consciousness and transformed your desire into aspiration.</p>
<p>So your limited desire to be only a poet has been transformed into a much vaster desire. Now you want only to be God's chosen instrument and to deal with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. You want to change the face of the vast world, and it is only as an instrument of God that you can do this: not as a poet, not as a philosopher, not as an artist, not as anybody but a true instrument of God.</p>
<p>You started with desire and your desire could have made you a poet. But now your aspiration is making you a true lover of mankind and a true saviour of mankind. So where is destruction? It is only the transformation of your limited consciousness into the unlimited consciousness, where not only possibility and practicability but also inevitability are constantly shaking hands with your inner life of aspiration and your outer life of revelation and manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What good does it do if a Yogi stays in a Himalayan cave and meditates?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What good does it do if a Yogi stays in a Himalayan cave and meditates?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An ordinary person will naturally say that this Yogi is of no use, that he is lost to the world. Humanity does not need him and, at the same time, he does not care for humanity. But this reasoning is faulty. The Yogi may be in a Himalayan cave, but what is he doing? He is meditating. He may not come into the world and talk sweetly or help humanity the way humanity wants to be helped. But when he identifies with the Supreme, his prayers and good will for humanity in the inner world are infinitely more effective and more powerful than any so-called philanthropy or service he could offer in the outer world.</p>
<p>When a Yogi sends forth his soul's will-power and light, it immediately covers the length and breadth of the world. If one enters into the inner world, one will immediately discover the power of a Yogi's goodwill. The Yogi is certainly helping humanity, but in his own way. So if people say that the spiritual Masters who are in the Himalayan caves are not doing anything for the world, they are mistaken. These spiritual Masters are doing something in the inner world which is very important and significant. Only those who have inner vision can see, feel and realise it.</p>
<p>There have been many spiritual figures who have stayed in caves in the mountain-tops and offered their soul's light and soul's concern to humanity. They are doing the right thing because their inner beings are telling them to help humanity in this way. Again, some Yogis operate in this way because they are afraid to mix with the world. They think that the moment they come into the world they will lose their aspiration or realisation; they will be caught again in the meshes of ignorance. So they say, "I have come out of bondage; now let me help the world from a distance." They see that the world is suffering, but they want to offer their help only from a distance. But the dynamic and heroic souls are not afraid of the world. They feel that they can identify with the world and, at the same time, maintain their inner power and inner oneness with God. They say: "Let us give what we have. To help even one individual we are ready to come into the world and mix with the world."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I trust my discrimination and know what is the right thing to do in my life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I trust my discrimination and know what is the right thing to do in my life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How do you know whether you are making the right decision? There is an inner being that will tell you what to do. God has given you something called conscience. Conscience will tell you how to discriminate. Perhaps a friend of yours is going to steal something and he wants you to help him. In this case, your conscience will simply say, "No, no, I don't want to be a thief." You don't want to be a thief. Why? Not because you will be caught red-handed and put into jail, but because your inner being, your conscience, tells you that stealing is something wrong, bad and undivine.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also your conscience will tell you what to do and what not to do. But in order to use your conscience as a guide, you have to be very careful. You have to remain calm and quiet; otherwise, your vital being will imitate the voice of your conscience and confuse you. It will make you feel that what you are doing is right, even though it is wrong. You don't have to learn how to meditate in order to be calm and quiet for a few minutes. Many times when you are tired and exhausted, you just sit quietly. So you <em>can</em> sit quietly, and when you do, you will hear the voice of your conscience. It will say either "yes" or "no." Only two words it has: "yes" and "no." You want to do something and if it says "yes," then you can do it. If it says "no", then never do it. You should not argue with your conscience; only you should listen to its voice.</p>
<p>Again, you have to know that there is a great difference between knowing what is right and wrong and achieving the right thing. Someone may know in a mental kind of way that God-realisation is good, but he may not cry for realisation. His mind may know that God-realisation is good, but he may not work for it. In your case, you not only know that God-realisation is good, but you go one step further: you pray and meditate. So you are bound to have realisation one day.</p>
<p>You started with conscience. Your conscience or your inner being told you that it was good to meditate. It told you that if you meditated, you would attain peace, light and bliss. You believed the inner message when you got it, and you launched into the spiritual life. When you enter the spiritual life, you not only know what is right but you also get the inner strength to do that very thing. Even a child knows the difference between what is right and what is wrong. But in spite of knowing, he may not have the capacity to do the right thing. But when one follows the spiritual life, one gets the inner strength to do what is right. A thief knows very well that it is not good to steal, but a thief will not have the strength to stop stealing, while someone who follows the spiritual life will definitely have the strength to realise God. So now that you have launched into the spiritual life, you can rest assured that you will not only be able to know what is right, but also to do what is right.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best approach is to see and feel that you are that very thing which you are seeking. You eternally are this reality but, unfortunately, right now you are not aware of it. Therefore, you have to cry for that which you already are. But it has to be a psychic cry. If you really want God's Beauty, then just cry and cry. But first you have to ask yourself if you <em>really</em> want God's Beauty. Is it just mental curiosity that is driving you to this reality, or do you desperately need it? If you feel that you desperately need this reality, if you feel that you want God's Beauty not because it will give you everything but because without God's Beauty you cannot exist, then it becomes the only reality in your life. There can be nothing else for you. At that time, naturally you will be living in God's Beauty.</p>

This moment you feel that God is very kind to you, but the next moment you get some blow or pain and you lose faith. Some unconscious part of you says, "O God, why are You so cruel to me? This morning I meditated well, so how is it that my body is suffering?" This will be your question to God. At that time if you can say "Although I am suffering such pain, perhaps something infinitely more serious was going to happen to me and God saved me. God is so kind to me." Like this, if you can change your attitude towards God, immediately the road becomes easier. You have some kind of pain, but if you feel that it could have been infinitely worse, then immediately you will see that you are making inner progress. The road is long only for those who do not feel gratitude to God. If you feel that something is bad and deplorable, then immediately think, "Oh, it could have been infinitely worse. It is out of God's infinite Compassion that He has not allowed a worse attack to come." If you have that kind of attitude, then the road becomes very, very easy.</p>
<p>Who actually causes you suffering and pain? It is not God. It is the hostile forces. They come and attack you in the form of disease and suffering. You have to tell them all the time, "I don't need you, I don't want you. I only want God." But when hostile forces attack you, unconsciously you cherish them; you, and most other human beings as well, cherish your suffering. Otherwise, it would not last for long.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One day we shall realise everything which is natural. God is natural and so naturally we shall realise Him. That is true, but it means that we shall have to wait for Eternity. God has given us a conscious mind and conscious aspiration. If we don't want to use our conscious aspiration, then we can wait. God is not compelling us or forcing us. We can sleep if we want to. But if we consciously pray and meditate, then we will go faster. Everybody will reach the Goal, but he who sleeps will not reach the Goal as fast as he who is running. One day everybody will realise God because in God's Cosmic Vision, He will never allow anyone to remain unrealised. But it will take a very long time. Again, if we want to wait, no harm; we can wait.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How did we ever lose God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How did we ever lose God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is within and without. We have not lost God; it is only that we do not care for Him. It is up to us to decide what to eat. If we don't want to eat a particular food, if we feel that it is not meant for us, then how can we go and blame others when we don't eat it? Food in this case, is God-realisation. It is there for us, but we don't want it. Right in front of us are both ignorance and knowledge. Unfortunately, we make friends with ignorance; that is why we live in constant doubt. If we remain in the soul, then we see and feel our constant oneness with God. But instead, we stay in the physical mind, which is totally unlit. It does not know anything. What we say one minute the mind will doubt or forget the next minute, because the mind is all ignorance. But if we remain in the soul, then even what we did hundreds of years ago in past incarnations, we will know.</p>
<p>He who lives in the soul, he who cares for God and cries for God, will never say that he has lost God. The moment a child cries for something, he gets it from his father. If we cry for Peace, Light and Bliss from our Eternal Father, then He will give it to us. If we cry for God, then He will come before us. So nothing is denied us; only we do not care for it. If we don't feel a sincere need for God, then we say that there is no God. But if we cry for God and feel our need for God, then we will see that we never lost God at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We say that someone is an atheist because he says that there is no God. I say that there is a God, but he says, "No God, no God, no God." When he goes to that extreme, he will see that his negative feeling itself is a form of positive feeling. At the extreme he says that there is nothing. But what he calls nothing is, for us, something; and that very thing we call God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sky is overcast with clouds and there are no stars or moon visible. But we know that when these clouds are dispersed, we will immediately be able to see the moon and the stars. When the clouds disappear we see that there is a moon, there are stars. But an atheist cannot see beyond the clouds; and he stays with the clouds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it important for a spiritual aspirant to have satisfaction?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it important for a spiritual aspirant to have satisfaction?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that you have worked hard at something, and now you are going to get the result in the form of an experience. If the experience comes in the form of failure, if you can take it as cheerfully as success, then your satisfaction is perfect. After working if you can gladly accept the result in the form of success or failure, then satisfaction is bound to dawn.</p>
<p>But if you don't work at all just because you are afraid that you will fail, then you will get zero; you will not pass the inner examination. True, there are people who do not work, yet they appear to be satisfied. But they are not actually satisfied. A lazy person, an idle person, can never, never be satisfied for even one minute. On the physical plane, a lazy person's satisfaction means that he does not have to work; he does not even have to climb down the staircase. But although he is satisfied on the physical plane, on the mental plane evil thoughts are making a big hole in his mind. He has stayed five hours in bed after the sun has dawned, so he has got satisfaction by stretching his legs. He is so satisfied because he did not have to budge an inch from his bed. But hostile, undivine forces, unlit emotional forces have all come and entered into him. So what kind of real satisfaction can he have?</p>
<p>If wrong forces enter into you, and you enjoy vital thoughts, then after an hour or two you will get up and cry. When the soul comes forward you will say, "What have I done? My first mistake was not to get up early in the morning. Then my second mistake was to indulge in these vital thoughts." This is what is happening in the spiritual life of many seekers. So I always say, do the right thing. Early in the morning, mediate. After meditation, if you are not very happy or peaceful, if you feel that peace has not descended, just offer your experience up to God. This very act of offering will be your satisfaction.</p>
