  <h2 id="page-title">Part I — What is meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part I — What is meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>What is meditation?</h2>

<p>What is meditation? Meditation is man's self-awakening and God's Self-offering. When man's self-awakening and God's Self-offering meet together, man becomes immortal in his inner consciousness and God becomes fulfilled in the world of manifestation. 'Meditation' is a most complicated and most fulfilling word. When we meditate without knowing how to meditate, when we meditate with our mind, it is most complicated. But when we meditate with our inner conviction, with the feeling of divinity within us, it becomes most fulfilling.</p>
<p>Meditation means conscious self-expansion. Meditation means one's conscious awareness of the transcendental Reality. Meditation means the recognition or the discovery of one's own true self. It is through meditation that we transcend limitation, bondage and imperfection. First we face limitations, imperfections and bondage, then we transform them, and afterwards we transcend them.</p>
<p>Meditation is the language of God. Now I am speaking English and you are able to understand me. If we want to communicate with God, then meditation is the language. It is the common language of man and God. God uses it and we use it. When we go deep within, into the deepest recesses of our hearts, we commune with God through meditation. It is through meditation that we can know that God is both with form and without form, with attributes and without attributes.</p>
<p>Meditation is dynamism on the inner planes of consciousness. If we want to achieve anything, either in our inner life or our outer life, then the help of meditation is of paramount importance. When we meditate, what we actually do is enter into the deeper part of our being. At that time, we are able to bring to the fore the wealth that we have deep within us. Meditation shows us how we can aspire for something and, at the same time, how we can achieve it. It is through meditation that we can enter into an object, a subject, a person, or into Infinity and Eternity. If we practice meditation daily, then we can rest assured that the problems of our life, inner and outer, are solved.</p>
<p>Why do we meditate? We meditate precisely because this world of ours has disappointed us and because failure looms large in our day-to-day life. We want fulfilment. We want joy, peace, bliss and perfection within and without. Meditation is the answer, the only answer.</p>
<p>True meditation can never be done with the mind. Very often we make a mistake when we say that we are meditating in the mind and utilising the mind. Real meditation is done in the psychic being and in the soul. It goes hand in hand with flaming aspiration, the burning flame that wants to climb up to the Highest.</p>
<p>Each soul is running consciously or unconsciously toward the Goal, but those who are running consciously will reach the Goal sooner than those who are still asleep. All human beings without exception will reach God, but through meditation we reach our Goal sooner. We have to know how fast we want to reach our goal. If I want to come to Puerto Rico from New York, I can come by boat, I can take a direct flight, or I can take a plane that stops at various places on the way. It is entirely up to me whether I take a direct route or an indirect route. There are many roads that lead to the Goal, but one road is sure to be shorter than the others. In the spiritual life, it is when we meditate on the heart that we make the fastest progress. Naturally, if we are wise we will take the shortest route. Each second counts.</p>
<p>Real meditation we get from within or from a spiritual Master. We can never get it from books. From books we can get inspiration or an inner approach to the fulfilment of our outer life. But in order to have true meditation we have to go deep within or follow the guidance of a spiritual Master. Each individual must have a meditation of his own. Each one has to follow a particular path. There is collective meditation and, at the same time, there is a specific meditation for each individual. If you are sitting in a group meditating collectively, that is wonderful, but if you want to realise God, then you have to have your own specific method. This specific way of meditating either your soul will tell you or you will get it from someone who can enter into your soul and see its possibilities, someone who can see how your particular soul wants to manifest the divine Truth here on earth. Some souls want to manifest the Divine on earth through Beauty, while other souls want to manifest the Divine through Power, Light or Bliss. You have to know what your soul wants and how your soul wants to take part in the cosmic Play. Only then will your meditation fulfil the Divine within you and the Divine in the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>There are many seekers whose meditation is not fruitful because they are not doing the meditation that is necessary for them. They are not meditating in the right way. When we meditate properly and soulfully, we can eventually expect a bumper crop of realisation. But if we are constantly knocking at the wrong door and meditating in a wrong way, then we are wasting our time.</p>
<p>Again, I wish to say that in the process evolution no human being will remain unrealised. It may take millennia, but each individual soul will realise God. Meditation tells us that yesterday's message is to be rejected, today's message is to be accepted and tomorrow's message is to be embraced. What is yesterday's message? Yesterday's message is frustration, imperfection and limitation. If we look backward we can immediately feel and realise that we were unfulfilled, we were imperfect, we were swimming in the sea of bondage. Today's message tells us to go deep within and see the face of reality. It makes us feel that the outer life can easily be transcended and that we can see God face to face. And tomorrow's message is that we can easily claim Divinity as our very own on the strength of our soulful aspiration and meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — Question and answers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — Question and answers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the aim of meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The ultimate aim of meditation is to establish our conscious union with God. We are all God's children, but right now we do not have conscious oneness with God. Even an atheist, who denies the existence of God, can use the word 'God'. His mouth can pronounce it, but he is not going to feel God's qualities. He is not going to feel anything for God. Again, someone may believe in God, but his belief is not a reality in his life. He just believes God exists because a saint or a Yogi or a spiritual Master has said that there is a God. But if we practise meditation, a day comes when we have established our conscious oneness with God. At that time, God gives us His infinite Peace, infinite Light and infinite Bliss, and we grow into this infinite Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>In the Upanishads it says that when someone is consciously one with God, he sees that from Delight he came into existence, in Delight he is growing, and at the end of his journey he will enter into Delight again:</p>

<p>Anandadd hy eva khalv<br /> Imani bhutani jayante<br /> Anandena jatani jivanti<br /> Anandam prayantyabhisam visanti</p>

<p>Ananda means Delight. God is Delight. When an aspirant realises God, he realises Delight and drinks Delight. When he becomes perfect in his meditation, or when he is on the verge of liberation, he sees that the ultimate aim of meditation is to achieve Light and Delight within himself in infinite measure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do we learn from meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do we learn from meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first thing that we learn from meditation is vastness. Meditation is the only way to expand our outer existence, our limited being. Without meditation, we would never expand ourselves; but if we meditate even for one minute, we have expansion.</p>
<p>What does expansion mean? In our expansion, we cross beyond the finite, and the finite enters into the infinite. We have come from the infinite, but we are playing the game of the finite. Instead, we should play the game of the infinite in the finite body. God is deep inside us. He wants to manifest Himself and we want to be His conscious instruments. The sense of being a conscious instrument we get only in our meditation. Otherwise, we feel, "I am the doer." When the ego comes forward, we immediately feel "I can say this, I can do this; I, I, I," whereas in meditation, when we go deep within, we feel that we have become just an instrument, a channel. If a divine thought comes, we immediately express it in a divine way and become more divine. But we can only become channels when the mind is calm and quiet.</p>
<p>In our meditation, we always have to know what we are aspiring after. Some people, in the name of meditation, permit all the worst kinds of thoughts and desires to enter them. When distracting thoughts enter into our mind during meditation, we have to ask ourselves what we are going to gain. Nothing, nothing! The best thing in meditation is to have no thoughts, emotions or ideas. No thought, not an iota of thought, should penetrate our mind. The mind is fertile soil. Only the divine seed should grow there, and not any outer, human thought or idea. Then, if we start meditating, and the mind is calm and quiet, say for five minutes, we will see or feel our inner being or psychic being. This being starts speaking in a different language, and through meditation we will be able to learn its language and be able to hear its message. At that time, the psychic being can mould our outer life.</p>
<p>This opportunity is given to everyone, but unfortunately, most of us do not try to meditate. God is inside us, but we have compelled Him to keep His eyes closed. Like a child playing, He is just trying to open His eyes, but we say, "No, no You must not open your eyes." But a day comes when we will, with our meditation and aspiration, bring the divine Child who is within us to the fore and look at Him. And we will see that the divine Child is no one other than ourselves. With our meditation, we consciously are trying to bring forward that Self of ours. Only meditation can accomplish this, nothing else.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What benefit can we get from meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What benefit can we get from meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has to fulfil himself either today or tomorrow. Why? If we are not fulfilled, we are not satisfied. Everybody wants to be fulfilled, everybody wants happiness. Without happiness we cannot stay on earth. In spite of being a multimillionaire, a rich man is unhappy because his money is not giving him satisfaction or happiness. Without happiness he remains miserable. Why do we want to be happy? Because we want fulfilment.</p>
<p>How can one be eternally happy? By making thousands of dollars a person may become happy for five minutes or for a day or for a few months. Then he becomes an ordinary beggar because his inner life is a barren desert. Eternal happiness is what he wants and needs. This eternal happiness he can get only from meditation. Meditation is the real soul of God and, at the same time, the real heart of man. The heart here is not the physical organ. It is that part of us which identifies itself with others. The heart means identification, identification with Truth and Light. During meditation, an aspiring heart can identify itself with Truth, Light and Beauty, with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. But this identification is not complete; our inseparable oneness with Divinity is not complete. Identification is one thing and fulfilment is something else. This identification has to be manifested here on earth and that is the purpose of the soul. Meditation is the soul of God, meditation is the heart of man. Aspiring man becomes the heart; realised man is the soul.</p>
<p>When we meditate, what do we actually do? First we enter into our highest Self. Then the highest Self meets the lowest self for transformation. The highest Self has to be realised; the lowest self has to be transformed. When we meditate we enter into the Highest for the realisation of the Brahman. We then enter into the lowest for the transformation of our nature.</p>
<p>Meditation has two things to offer us: self-mastery and self-transformation. These two go together. When we meditate, immediately we have the beginnings of self-mastery, and when we have self-mastery, we see that we cannot cherish ugly or undivine thoughts; we cannot remain inside ignorance anymore. At that time we see that our transformation is taking place. Meditation is constantly giving us the message of self-transformation. Many years ago we were in plant life, then we were in animal life. Now we are in human life and we are bound to be in divine life. This self-transformation has to be done through inner meditation. When we meditate unconsciously, it takes a long, long time to reach the Goal. Only when we are at the human stage do we begin meditating consciously. When we meditate consciously, we make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>Without meditation no human being can have inseparable oneness with God. If we want any real peace, real joy, real love, then we have to meditate. The so-called peace we feel in our day-to-day lives is five minutes of peace after ten hours of anxiety, worry and frustration. But that is no peace at all. We are at the mercy of the monkeys around us — jealousy, fear, doubt, worries, anxiety and despair. The monkeys take rest for a few minutes, and then we say that we are enjoying peace. But no, it is only that monkeys are tired of biting us. The next moment all the negative monkey-forces will attack us again.</p>
<p>We get divine peace through meditation. Even if we meditate for fifteen minutes and get peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace, if it is solid peace, will be able to permeate our whole day. If in the morning we have meditated at six o'clock, in the evening we will still feel inner peace, inner joy, inner light. It is all solid power from our meditation that we are getting, and these things last for some time. When we have a meditation of the highest order, then we get really abiding peace, light and delight. We need meditation because we want to grow in light and we want to fulfil ourselves in light and through light. If this is our choice, if this is our aspiration, if this is our thirst, then meditation is the only way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, one can enter the spiritual world through constant meditation. It is inevitable. In fact, that is the very reason why we aspire. We aspire only to enter into the spiritual world, the inner world. You have already entered it thousands of times with your aspiration and meditation. But right now you do not have the capacity to distinguish the inner world from the outer world.</p>
<p>In the physical world, one person is on the animal level, another is on the human level and a third is on the divine level. In the spiritual world also there are grades; there is a ladder of consciousness. When you enter into the spiritual world with your sincere aspiration, a day will dawn when you will be able to recognise these planes of consciousness. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. When you are about to have your Self-realisation, or when your psychic being comes and tells you, you will know which world you are in. You can enter into these inner worlds and recognise them on the strength of your meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does spiritual awareness come only through meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does spiritual awareness come only through meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It comes either through meditation or aspiration. Also, if a great, advanced soul, a spiritual Master, wants to make you aware of the inner, spiritual life, he can do so. If a person does not aspire and meditate, but a spiritual Master wants to inspire that person because he sees that he has spiritual capacity, he can do so. If somebody is fast asleep in the spiritual world, but he has potentiality, then the Master awakens the flame of aspiration within him.</p>
<p>But generally it is through meditation that one can become aware of one's inner life. Prayer is very good, but it does not help as much. With your prayer, you are making contact with an object or a person; but with your meditation you are entering into the vast universe. The universe becomes yours when you enter into your deepest meditation; the whole world is at your disposal. When we know how to meditate, then the entire world becomes ours; whereas in prayer it is only me and God. Humanity as a whole is not entering into the picture.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God-realisation means our constant, conscious feeling of inseparable oneness with the Highest. It is not a matter of feeling or thinking; it is our actual experience. When we realise God, we discover our own reality, our own Self-form. God-realisation and Self-discovery are the same thing. In our discovery, we see all that we truly are. We see that the entire universe is of us and for us. God-realisation means that we are part and parcel of God. At the same time it makes us feel that everything that is within and without belongs to us.</p>
<p>When the seeker becomes one with God, God uses him to fulfil the need of humanity. On the strength of his own oneness with humanity, he brings down a most delicious meal from above, to feed its hunger. And at the same time, he carries humanity to the highest Height. A God-realised person is a messenger. He carries humanity's aspiration to the highest plane and he brings down from above God's Compassion and Blessings. This moment he represents earth-consciousness; the next moment, Heaven-consciousness. What earth-consciousness is, he will bring to Heaven; what Heaven-consciousness offers, he carries to earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the highest meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the highest meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The highest meditation is when you do not have any thoughts at all. Right now when we are meditating, we are victims to many thoughts undivine thoughts, ugly thoughts, evil thoughts. At other times we do a kind of meditation where we get fairly good thoughts, divine thoughts, fulfilling thoughts and illumining thoughts. This is a higher state. But when we are in the Highest, there will be no thoughts, either good or bad. There it is only Light.</p>
<p>In Light, vision and reality go together. Now you are sitting there and I am standing here. You are the reality, I am the vision. I have to look at you and see that you are the reality. Then I have to enter into you in order to know that you are the reality. But when we do the highest meditation, at that time it is not like that. Reality and vision are together. Where you are, I have to be. Where I am, you have to be, because we are one. That is why we do not need thoughts or ideas in the highest meditation. Now when a thought enters into us, we give it form. Then we come to understand what is going on, or what we are talking about. But when you see the Truth, when you see that the knower and the thing that is to be known are together, then there is no thought. This is the highest type of meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the stages of meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the stages of meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three stages: concentration, meditation and contemplation. These are like three rungs of a ladder, the ladder of aspiration.</p>
<p>We start with concentration. When we concentrate, we focus all our attention on a particular object and become totally one with that object. When our concentration is very deep, there can be no thought, not an iota of thought inside us or around us. We and the object of our concentration are one.</p>
<p>Concentration is the mind's dynamic will that operates in us for our immediate acceptance of light and rejection of darkness. It also awakens within us the planes of consciousness that are fast asleep. What concentration can do in our life of aspiration is unimaginable. It can easily separate Heaven from hell, so that we can live in the constant delight of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and tortures of hell while we are here on earth. If we can concentrate well, we will be able to make fast progress. If we can focus all our attention on a particular object, if we can enter into it with our mind, we will be able to discover and reveal the hidden, ultimate Truth inside it. Now we are victims to unlit, obscure, destructive and malignant thoughts, but a day will come when, on the strength of our concentration, we will feel that disturbing thoughts are afraid of us. In concentration we work for an immediate result; but meditation does not care for success in this sense. Meditation only wants to enter into the Vast and swim in the vast sea of Peace, Light and Bliss. When we meditate, we have to feel that we are entering into something vast and infinite: the vast ocean or the infinite blue sky. We are trying to plunge into something boundless and measureless. All around us is the infinite blue sky where Peace is reigning supreme. First we have to feel this, and then we have to become fully one with the Vastness itself. When we are concentrating, we can use our mental willpower to some extent. But in meditation we use our psychic willpower, the soul's willpower. In meditation we have to go far beyond the domain of the mind, because the mental faculty is very limited. When we are in our highest, deepest meditation, we have to stop the functioning of the mind.</p>
<p>Concentration is like an arrow that hits the target. When we concentrate, we aim at something with a dynamic attitude. But meditation is calm, divine, soulful and elevating. When we meditate, we make the mind calm, quiet and still — without thoughts. At that time, we have to be fully aware of the arrival of thoughts and allow no idle thoughts to enter into the mind. The mind is vacant and tranquil, with neither good nor bad thoughts; nothing at all. Our whole existence becomes an empty vessel. When this vessel is absolutely empty, with our whole inner being we invoke infinite Peace, Light and Bliss so it will enter into the vessel and fill it. This is meditation.</p>
<p>Then comes contemplation, which is the last stage before we realise God. With contemplation we enter into samadhi and the transcendental Consciousness. Contemplation is something extremely difficult for beginners in the spiritual life, but eventually the beginner becomes advanced and he, too, learns how to contemplate, for without contemplation one can never realise the Highest. In contemplation we are at once in our deepest concentration and our highest meditation. We lose our so-called outer existence, the existence that binds. At that time there is no mind; it is as though the physical mind did not exist. In contemplation we become totally one with God's universal Will, the transcendental Will, which plays the part of both the doer and the action. The doer and the action become totally one when we are in contemplation. The knower, the knowing and the known become one.</p>
<p>During contemplation we become merged into the inner stream; it is all one stream of consciousness. From the soles of our feet to the crown of our head, consciousness is flowing. We feel the flow of consciousness all over our body, and feel that we are nothing but the consciousness itself. We become part and parcel of the infinite Consciousness, the eternal Consciousness, the immortal Consciousness. We become totally one with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality in the highest state of contemplation.</p>
<p>There are two types of consciousness. One is earth-bound consciousness, the other is boundless Consciousness, infinite Consciousness. When we are limited, we become one with the earth-bound consciousness. Here we see 'me' and 'mine'. But the unlimited Consciousness that is flowing inside our being is one with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. When we are contemplating, we feel that we are dealing with Infinity, not around us but inside us.</p>
<p>You may say, "My body is only five feet, eight inches tall, so how can I house Infinity inside me? How can I house Eternity and Immortality? It is all absurd." But no, you have to feel that you are not the body; you are the soul. Our Indian scriptures say that the soul has neither birth nor death, neither beginning nor end. It is something which is constantly moving — moving, flowing, manifesting the infinite Truth. In contemplation we become totally identified with our soul and go to the highest and spread our wings. From the finite we enter into the infinite; we enter into the world of Peace, Light and Bliss, where there is direct oneness with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>
<p><em>Infinity</em>. The word will seem to come from your imagination. What is Infinity? Try to feel it is something that is going to make you free from ignorance. Now we are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, but Infinity is something that is freeing us from the meshes of ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Eternity</em>. What is it? We have two lives — an ordinary human life, where we stay on earth for fifty, sixty or seventy years, and eternal Life. The eternal Life existed before our birth; it exists during this short span of our life; it passes through the dark tunnel of death. Then again it enters into its own Source. When you think of Eternity, feel that it is something which precedes everything and, at the same time, will succeed everything.</p>
<p><em>Immortality</em>. Nothing remains permanent on earth. Today somebody is a great beauty; tomorrow her beauty pales into insignificance. Today somebody is very prominent in the world; tomorrow his prominence is forgotten. No matter how great or how sublime we are, the jaws of death devour us sooner or later. What can we do? We have to feel the Immortality of Consciousness. The finite consciousness, when it becomes one with the infinite, becomes immortal. When the finite consciousness becomes immortal, then God's divine Play can take place here on earth and God can be really fulfilled.</p>
<p>When you are contemplating, you will feel that you are dealing with three sublime, significant truths: Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. In contemplation your body, vital, mind and heart do not act separately. They become totally one. They are completely united and, like obedient children, they listen to the dictates of the soul. Once they listen to the soul, you become the soul itself, and this is the truest contemplation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Contemplation shows us God in both His personal and impersonal aspects. If we want to see the personal God, then we will see Him face to face. He will stand in front of us in a most luminous Form. If we want to see God's impersonal aspect, we will enter into the impersonal God as an infinite expanse of Peace, Light and Bliss. Again, we can know God in both aspects. Just as one may want to have milk today and tomorrow ice cream, the same person may like to see the personal God with form today, and tomorrow the formless, impersonal God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you please discuss how contemplation differs from meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you please discuss how contemplation differs from meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you meditate on a specific divine quality, such as Light, Beauty, Peace, or Bliss in an unshaped form, or if you meditate in an abstract way on Infinity, Eternity or Immortality, then constantly you will feel an express train going forward inside you. You are meditating on Peace, Light or Bliss while the express train is constantly moving. Although your whole mind is calm, vacant and quiet, without thoughts, you will see there a movement towards your goal. Your mind is calm and quiet in the vastness of Infinity, but there is movement: a train is going endlessly toward your goal. In meditation there is a goal. You are envisioning a goal and meditation takes you there.</p>
<p>In contemplation it is not like that. The entire universe, the Goal, the farthest Goal, is deep inside you. When you have contemplated, your whole existence has become a perfect receptacle to hold all of Divinity deep inside you. When you are contemplating, you are holding within yourself the entire universe with all its infinite Light, Peace, Bliss and Truth. There is no thought, no form, no idea, nothing. Everything is merged in contemplation; all is one. In your highest contemplation, you are one with the Absolute. But in your highest meditation there is a dynamic movement. That movement is not aggressive; you are not beating or striking anyone, far from it. But a dynamic movement is going on in your alert consciousness. You are fully aware of what is happening in the inner world and in the outer world, and, at the same time, you are not affected. In contemplation you are also not affected, but there you and your whole existence have become part and parcel of the universe, which you are holding deep inside you. This is the main difference between contemplation and meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: After we have finished meditating, how do we go about contemplating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: After we have finished meditating, how do we go about contemplating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this stage of your inner life, you need not do contemplation. Contemplation comes after quite a few years of spiritual practice. When one is very advanced in the spiritual life, at that time contemplation starts. Here among my disciples only very, very, very few have even a limited capacity for contemplation; otherwise, all are up to the meditation stage. Contemplation is a very high state, and even those few who have the capacity cannot contemplate at their sweet will. So please think only of meditation right now. Please don't be offended, but the time has not yet come for you. But one day, in the near or distant future, it is bound to come.</p>
<p>Contemplation is required before God-realisation. It cannot be ignored or avoided. But the necessity for contemplation has not yet come because your concentration and meditation are not yet perfect. When concentration is perfect and meditation is perfect, then the necessity of contemplation is imminent. Contemplation also has to be perfect. Then, after we have climbed up these three rungs on the ladder of Self-realisation, we really enter into the Highest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you explain the difference between meditation and thinking?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you explain the difference between meditation and thinking?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a tremendous difference. Meditation and thinking are like the North Pole and the South Pole. Of course it depends on who is meditating. My meditation will be different from yours, and yours will be different from your neighbour's. A rich man eats delicate food and a poor man eats coarse, simple food. But in either case, there is still no comparison between meditation and thinking. In meditation we try to go beyond the mind. The mind is restless and agitated. This thought, that thought, worries, plans: this is what fills the mind. The mind usually leads nowhere. Even a disciplined mind gets no truth or knowledge from itself. The mind is like a cage. But in meditation we try to get to a plane beyond the mind where Knowledge, Light, Peace and Bliss abound.</p>
<p>Even reflection, which is a quiet kind of introspective thinking, is far from the disciplined vastness of meditation. Only in meditation is the divine Bliss to be found. Meditation is liberation from the mind. The mind is limitation. The mind is bondage because it can never get away from the forces which make it work. The mind has its purpose, but in the spiritual life, we have to go far above the mind where there is eternal Peace, eternal Knowledge and eternal Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Light is Delight. Again, Delight is God, God the Light. In one of our Upanishads it is said that all human beings come into the world from Delight. We grow in Delight, but we do not feel the Delight because we live on the surface of life. We live in ignorance; that is why we do not see and feel the inner Delight. We came from Delight. We grow in Delight. And at the end of our journey we enter into the effulgence of Delight, we retire into Delight.</p>
<p>This experience we get only when we meditate. When we meditate, we get inner peace, peace of mind. Delight is visible, palpable, tangible only when we have peace of mind. Unfortunately the modern, intellectual mind, the doubting mind, the sophisticated mind, does not care for this kind of Delight, which is nothing other than Light. The mind cries for outer information or it cries to achieve some partial truth. Again, while achieving the Truth, it negates the Truth. It doubts the Truth. The mind sees the Truth for five seconds, but just when it is about to achieve the Truth, it doubts the possibility, the reality of Truth. Then who is the loser? The Truth or the mind? Undoubtedly the mind.</p>
<p>If we live in the heart, then the heart gives us the message of identification. If we identify ourselves with Light, immediately we become Light. Inside the heart is the soul. So, if we can live even for a minute each day in our inner existence, then we can see Light in abundant measure. We can see it and we can feel it. When we feel this Light, we feel the possibility of growing into the effulgence of Light. The moment we see Light within us, the moment we see our inner Sun, which is infinitely brighter than the physical sun, we feel that the ignorance-night of millennia is gone. So let us try to go deep within and enter into the inner Sun, the cosmic Sun, that we all have. There we shall see that this Light, the infinite Light, is waiting for us and crying for us. It only needs our conscious acceptance and cooperation.</p>
