  <h2 id="page-title">The Master&#039;s sandals</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Master&#039;s sandals" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>King Shivaji was so happy to be serving his Master in the temple. After some time, his Master asked him, "Do you want to stay here permanently?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is what I want," replied the King. "I am not going back to my kingdom."</p>
<p>"But I want you to go back to your kingdom," said Ramdas.</p>
<p>King Shivaji was puzzled. "You do not want me to have this kind of happiness? Please believe me, I do not want my kingdom. I want to be here at your feet. Let somebody else take care of my kingdom. I want to remain here. I want to be your servant forever."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "No, you have to go back."</p>
<p>Finally, Shivaji was forced to accept his Master's command. As he was leaving, he pleaded with Ramdas, "Can you not give me your sandals at least? I shall place them on the throne."</p>
<p>Ramdas willingly gave the King his sandals. Then he said "I will come occasionally to visit you. But, remember: you are not the King. You are a mere instrument. I am the King."</p>
<p>Shivaji bowed and replied, "If you are the King, then I am fully prepared to go back. As I have been your slave here, I am ready to go back to my kingdom and be your slave there. Inwardly you will guide me, and I will do everything in the way that you want me to."</p>
<p>This is how Shivaji went back to rule his kingdom. He took his Master's sandals and placed them on the throne with the absolute faith that they would guide and protect him at every moment. The same thing also happened in the life of our first Avatar, Sri Ramachandra. When Sri Ramachandra was compelled to go into exile for fourteen years, his brother Bharat took his sandals and placed them on the throne as a symbol that he was only taking care of the kingdom until Rama returned.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The renunciate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The renunciate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On another occasion, King Shivaji entered into a temple and started shedding bitter tears. He was crying piteously and saying that he did not want to return to his palace. One of his attendants said to him, "O King, what are you doing? You have to come back to us. Who will rule the country in your place?"</p>
<p>For more than ten days Shivaji stayed inside the temple. He kept saying, "I am not going back. I want to live here." Many people tried to persuade him to give up this idea. They said, "How can a king live inside a temple? It is absurd! You have to come back and rule your kingdom."</p>
<p>But Shivaji was adamant. He refused to go back. Finally, he said, "Since I am not allowed to live here, I want to be allowed to die here."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked his frightened attendants.</p>
<p>Shivaji immediately pulled out his sword and was about to kill himself. His attendants rushed to his side and grabbed the sword from his hands.</p>
<p>Shivaji told them, "You will not allow me to live; you will not allow me to die. Either allow me to live here or allow me to die here, but I will not go back. I do not need the material life; I want only the spiritual life. I have had enough of being King. Is there anything this world has not given me? I have name and fame, everything, but I do not have peace, I do not have inner joy. When I enter into a temple, I am filled with peace and joy. This is what I need. Being a king, I have everything and I have done everything. But now I do not want to remain King for even one moment longer. I want to stay here inside this temple and only pray and meditate, pray and meditate, pray and meditate. I know this is the only way I can get true satisfaction in my life."</p>
<p>But Shivaji's attendants would not listen to their King's soulful request. They continued begging him and begging him to return to the palace. Eventually, he was compelled to surrender to their demands.</p>
<p>Shivaji was extremely devoted to the goddess Bhavani, who was his family deity. He later built a very beautiful temple dedicated to this aspect of the Divine Mother. Bhavani is the Goddess of Power, the Goddess that was awakening the slumbering India.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">“Mother, take me!&quot;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="“Mother, take me!&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Shivaji always said that he loved only one woman in the world, and that was his mother, Jija Bai. She lived to see her son crowned Chhatrapati Shivaji, the King of the entire Maratha State, in 1674. Less than two weeks later, she passed away, leaving Shivaji completely heartbroken. He used to cry out, "Mother, take me! I do not want to remain here on earth without you." Pining for his mother, Shivaji lived only a few years more. He passed away in 1680 at the age of 52.</p>
<p>When Shivaji's funeral pyre was lit, his faithful dog, Vaghya, jumped into the flames to be with his master. A statue of the little dog now faces Shivaji's shrine at Fort Raigad.</p>
<p>Shivaji's Guru, Ramdas, left the body in 1681, soon after the death of his dear disciple.</p>

<p>Shivaji was succeeded by his eldest son, Shambhuji. The Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb was determined to subdue the son of his old adversary and regain control of Maharashtra. In 1689, Moghul troops captured Shambhuji and tortured him mercilessly. When he refused to become a Muslim or to reveal where the Maratha treasure was hidden, they blinded him and cut out his tongue. A few days later, Shambhuji was executed. The brutal death of Shambhuji caused all the Marathas to unite under the leadership of Rajaram, Shivaji's second son, and to renew their heroic efforts to resist the Moghul domination of India.</p>

<p>In most of his poems and songs, Rabindranath Tagore extols Bengal to the skies and says that the rest of India should follow in the footsteps of Bengal. But when it came to Shivaji, Tagore urged Bengalis to follow Shivaji's example. Shivaji's motto, his sacrifice, his courage and self-giving all received the utmost praise from Tagore. He said, "O Bengalis, follow him, follow him. Follow Shivaji and say: 'Victory to Shivaji! Victory to Shivaji!'" This was Tagore's immortal poem.</p>

<p>The main point of the Shivaji stories is this: earthly happiness, earthly riches and earthly name and fame are no match for inner peace and happiness. Shivaji's name and fame spread far beyond the boundaries of Maharashtra. They covered the length and breadth of the entire sub-continent. Even the British Government had tremendous admiration for him. And the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb was extremely jealous of Shivaji because he was so powerful and indomitable.</p>
<p>Shivaji's outer capacities were all due to his moral courage, plus the virtue of his prayer-life and meditation-life. To him, prayer and meditation were infinitely more important than being a king or remaining a king. He wanted to be God's slave and not man's king.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Everything can be fruitful</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Everything can be fruitful" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In these stories about King Shivaji, we see that spirituality is infinitely higher than anything we can achieve here on earth. Everything is meaningless and useless, save and except spirituality. Again, everything can be meaningful and fruitful if spirituality is inside that very thing. This is what Shivaji's Guru, Ramdas, taught him. Ramdas said, "You go back to your palace and carry me inside you. I will rule the country through you. I will guide all your people."</p>
<p>Spirituality was Shivaji's life-breath. Not as a king was he happy, but as the servant of his Master. When Shivaji brought spirituality into his outer activities, he discovered peace, peace, peace.</p>

<p>I have always been a great admirer of Shivaji. At the Sri Aurobindo Ashram where I grew up, our teachers used to give us marks out of four. If you got four out of four, it was excellent; if you got three, it was very good; two was good; one was fair and zero was "tolerable."</p>
<p>One time my Bengali teacher asked us all to write an essay on Shivaji. We had to write it in the classroom, not as homework.</p>
<p>I was at that time around thirteen or fourteen years old. The teacher was so pleased with my essay that he gave me eight out of four! The principal came to know of it and he said to this particular teacher, "Are you crazy? How can you give eight out of four?" Then they had a serious altercation.</p>
<p>By giving me eight out of four for my essay on Shivaji, my Bengali teacher — who was so fond of me — got into trouble with the principal!</p>
