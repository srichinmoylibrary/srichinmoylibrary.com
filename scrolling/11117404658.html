<p>Later, on my way to the tennis court, I was walking quickly in the street and four or five black children were walking lifelessly towards me. They looked right at me and said, "Oh, he thinks he is a big shot!"</p>
<p>I was in an absolutely soulful consciousness. What could I do or say?</p>

<p>Now when I run races, I see many people who start out ahead of me fall behind me after one mile. Of course, the really excellent runners have gone far, far ahead â€” God knows where. I can't even see their backs.</p>
<p>In today's five-mile race, towards the end I passed ten or twelve people. Then one girl went ahead of me. She looked at me to see if I was going to try to catch her, and in silence I said, "Go ahead." Later I caught her.</p>
<p>Another girl went ahead of me after four miles. She was taller than I am and so strong and muscular. Again in silence I said, "All right, go ahead."</p>

<p>At one point in the race I passed Gayatri. She was wearing white. Then later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone in white coming along my side to pass me. I said, "How can Gayatri be running so fast?" Then I turned a little and saw that the person who was passing me had short hair. I said, "This can't be Gayatri." Finally I turned all the way around and saw that it was a man. Gayatri could not keep pace with me.</p>

<p>During one of the times that I went to London secretly, without telling the disciples that I was going, I went out running. Suddenly I heard someone call, "Guru!"</p>
<p>I said, "Who could that be?" Then I saw Shankara. I said, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>She said, "I am going to school."</p>
<p>Another time when I went there secretly, a car started following me while I was running. I started to get annoyed because the car was following me. I didn't know there were disciples inside. Finally, the driver came out and said, "Are you Guru?" It was Devashishu's parents, Kaivalya and Bhavani, who live in London. At that time they had just joined our path.</p>

<p>In North Carolina the "Fifty Oneness-State-Songs" course was very hilly, and it was on a major highway. At one point I had to make a left turn from the right side of the road. If the disciples had told me ahead of time, I would have crossed the highway long before the actual turn. But they did not tell me. They just suddenly said, "Go left!" Chetana and Begabati were supposed to stop the traffic at the turn. But Chetana was only telling me a car was coming. She was not stopping the cars at all. She was only informing me that they were coming. There I lost so much time. I had to come to a total standstill and wait. Then Begabati was standing with her back to the cars and her arms spread, just looking at me. I lost so much time because of these two.</p>

<p>At one point in the sixth mile of the North Carolina course, there was a 300-metre hill. What could I do? Perhaps when the boys were measuring the course, they were half asleep, so they did not even notice the hill.</p>
<p>The San Francisco course was absolutely the best, so far, of all the "Fifty Oneness-State-Songs" courses. It was totally flat.</p>

<p>While I was watching the videotape of my run in North Carolina, I couldn't believe my eyes. I know that I am not a strong runner, but the videotape showed that I looked very strong â€” like another Bholanath. In the chest, back and thighs, there appeared to be so much strength!</p>
<p>At the same time, I was seeing the speed of a dead elephant and I was feeling and identifying with the dead elephant-runner in myself. I said, "If I really have that much strength, why am I going so slowly?"</p>

<p>Sunanda is a first-class blind disciple. Today I was running behind her for 200 metres down the 150th Street hill, with only a 50-metre gap between us. I saw her, but she didn't see me.</p>
<p>Later I saw her again near Jamaica High School. Databir was screaming her name from the car, but still she didn't see me.</p>
<p>I have so many blind disciples. I saw Saroja running, but she was so discouraged that she didn't see me. Sunanda had been running quite fast, but Saroja was running slowly. Perhaps she was disappointed in her running.</p>
<p>Then I saw Pratibha. She was looking at my car, but she didn't recognise it.</p>

<p>Then while people were receiving prizes, they announced my name and said that I had run. When Dipali got a prize, they said that she was from the Sri Chinmoy team. Then they said, "Sri Chinmoy also ran."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Why does Sri Chinmoy have to run?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Why does Sri Chinmoy have to run?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I ran a four-mile race in Central Park. At the start I saw a middle-aged man talking to his wife and a friend. I was only ten metres away from them, by the side of the road. The man pointed to me and said, "I don't know why he has to run. Of all people he has to run."</p>
<p>His wife asked him, "Why are you saying that?"</p>
<p>The man said, "He is Sri Chinmoy, and his disciples run all over the world." Then he mentioned Tarak's name â€” no surname, just Tarak. "His disciple Tarak is going all over the country, running thousands and thousands of miles. Now why does Sri Chinmoy have to run?" he said.</p>
<p>His wife asked, "What is wrong with it?"</p>
<p>I was filled with pride and gratitude for what Tarak was doing. Then the man said, "He and his disciples are doing a very good job."</p>
<p>At that time I wanted to change my shoes, so Bipin ran and got another pair of running shoes from Dhanu's car. The man was looking at me with such appreciation, and I smiled at him. I was so embarrassed that everyone was helping me with my shoes while I was sitting there like a king. I tried to take one shoe and put it on myself, but unconsciously Nirvik pulled it away from me. I didn't want these people to see Nirvik put on my shoes. If it had been after the race, they could have thought that I was dying, but the race had not even started yet.</p>

<p>At the four-mile race there was a dog that was very bad. What was he doing in the race? The owner was there, taking the dog to this side and that side. Sometimes the dog wouldn't listen to him.</p>
<p>Children should be forbidden in these kinds of races. They should have their own races. It is so hard to run with them! They never, never stay in a straight line. While I take one step, they take three steps. And during these three steps they move like snakes â€” all serpentine winding!</p>
