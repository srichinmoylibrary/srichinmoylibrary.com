<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At times the wrong forces, hostile forces, take the form of spiritual persons or a spiritual Master and they appear in a dream. At times they are successful and they do many bad things. How can you recognise them and how can you distinguish the real Master from the hostile forces? When a wrong force, a hostile force, stands in front of you in your dream in the form of your spiritual Master or a great saint, the first thing you will notice is its impurity. If you see there is no purity, then immediately you will know that it is not the Master, but a wrong force in the form of the Master. Many times it has happened that the wrong forces came and stood in front of a seeker, and the seeker bowed down to these wrong forces. You must never, never bow down in a dream unless and until you are sure that that particular person is really your Master or Krishna, Christ, the Buddha or some other great spiritual Master. Otherwise, the moment you bow down and touch the person's feet, occultly that wrong force will take away some of your divine qualities. I know of many, many cases in India in which sincere aspirants have been mercilessly attacked by wrong forces. They thought that it was their Master, and they lost their divine qualities. So when you see your Master in a dream, first see if he brings with him a flood of purity and the fragrance of a flower or the radiance of light. This purity can never be brought by the wrong forces. The moment you feel absolute purity and the fragrance of flowers, you can rest assured that it is a divine person who has come. But if he feels impure or if you are alarmed or frightened, then you can be sure that it is an impersonation by a wrong force.</p>
<p>Some people have good dreams about their Master while others have silly, absurd dreams and then they are confused. It is not the fault of the Master. The disciple must distinguish one from the other.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a dream of me, all your beings are fed with joy. The outer being will get the result in a day or two or three. But if you don't have any dreams about me for two, four, six months, that doesn't mean that you have made no progress. If you meditate well you will get the same result. But if you see me in a dream, it is a sign. It is not that I shall only flatter you. Sometimes I may scold. As I scold outwardly, I can also scold inwardly. It is for your good that I am doing it. It is another opportunity for you when you have a dream of me. Those who live near me see me so many times in the physical world. But the dream world is also a world where people can approach me.</p>
<p>If you see me in a dream in the morning, it often means that your heart or soul has made a special effort to commune with me. Or it may happen that you have not made any effort, but that I want to see you, because I feel that your heart needs special treatment. That is why you see me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One's environmental circumstances <em>can</em> increase one's aspiration and spirituality and also they can destroy these things. But, often we give too much importance to our environmental circumstances. Many people on earth have come into the world in an ordinary, unaspiring family, but they have gone very far and very deep in their inner life. Again, there are many people who have come into the world in a high, spiritual family and yet led a most ordinary life.</p>
<p>All spiritual Masters have brothers, sisters, friends, relatives and so forth who live in the same environment as they do. But you don't hear anything about their friends or their relatives. When you hear about the spiritual Master, you also hear about his dearest disciples, who become immortal. The Master's spiritual children become his real children, whereas his own physical children are nowhere. The spiritual people around a Master, who also pray and meditate with him, become his real children.</p>
<p>If, from our forefathers, we get something that is good, we can increase it. But again, even if we don't get any spiritual help from our origins, we can still realise and manifest the Highest if the soul comes to the fore. But those who are meant to be spiritual and divine do not depend either on the members of the family from which they came or on the circumstances of their environment. Their inner power pushes them toward the highest height and manifests their divine qualities.</p>
<p>Question: But was it the Supreme in you that visited my husband?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My soul visits everyone. Not my physical consciousness, but my soul visits everyone. So my soul visited him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should we do if we have a frightening dream that foretells the death of somebody?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should we do if we have a frightening dream that foretells the death of somebody?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a frightening dream, please pay no attention to it. Suppose you dream that something bad is going to happen in your life. If you are frightened, you are already dead. But if you are not frightened, then during the few hours or the few days that lie between your dream and the actual occurrence you can fight against it. And the divine Grace is bound to come and help you at that time. Suppose you have a dream that a friend or relative of yours will pass away, and your dream is absolutely correct. Tomorrow he will surely die; but if you are frightened now, then today he is already dead for you. If you surrender to the dream, you will suffer unnecessarily before the actual hour. Also, your fear will immediately enter into the future victim and create an additional burden for him.</p>
<p>What you should do at that time is try to fight against the possibility of his death through prayer and meditation. Pray to God, "I have seen it. O God, save him, save him." Instead of being frightened, try to offer your prayer to God. Perhaps you think that prayer is something feminine or delicate. No! Your prayer is your greatest strength. God's strength is His Compassion and man's strength is his prayer. Or you can meditate. That will be an even mightier strength. If you fight and God's Grace descends, I assure you that you can delay the actuality of the person's death. Many times it has happened that spiritual seekers have dreamed that their relatives were going to die and immediately they started meditating and praying to God. Then, God's Grace descended. But God does not nullify the possibility. He may just delay the actual event.</p>
<p>Why does God help the aspirant in cases like this? God helps because God is not bound by cosmic law. Cosmic law is created by God and at any time He can break His own law. If He cannot break His own law, then He is not omnipotent. And you can make God break His law through your soulful prayer. God says, "This is to be done." He has recorded it. But when human prayer enters into His Heart, He may cancel His own decree.</p>
<p>When you have hopeful dreams, illumining dreams, encouraging dreams, when you see that something significant is going to take place in a friend's life, what you should do is consciously try to identify your soul with his soul. How will you do this? Through your meditation. He will eventually get joy from the event because it belongs to him. But this joy, by God's Grace, you have received before he actually has. If you are wise, you will go deep within and assimilate the joy that you have received and then try to offer it to him inwardly before he gets it directly from God. Otherwise, if you tell him, "You know, I had a wonderful dream about you," he will be happy for a second, and then he will doubt you. He will say, "Oh, it is all mental hallucination." Despite your best intention, his doubtful mind will throw cold water on your encouraging message. So instead of telling the person verbally, try consciously to offer him the joy of the dream through your meditation. At that time, he will get additional strength. Before he gets the experience of your dream, which will come to him in the form of reality, he will start getting inner peace, inner joy, which he cannot account for, because you have started injecting him, preparing him to receive something very high, very meaningful and fulfilling. And when you have good dreams about yourself, go deep within and prepare yourself to be ready, to be a fit instrument for the reality, to receive the reality as it should be received.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. When we have dreams coming from the lower worlds, the subconscious worlds — or you can say, inconscient worlds — we have to feel that these dreams have no value. They cannot change our nature. They cannot inspire us. They cannot give us any hope for our future fulfilment. When we get a dream from the vital plane, we will see that the dream will be constant movement. It will be like a battlefield where everything is breaking and smashing and people are being killed. These dreams cannot help us at all in our spiritual life. The best thing we can do is forget them. If the dream comes from the mental plane, there will be some poise-not full poise, but a little poise, a little calm and quiet there. If it comes from the psychic plane, we will feel affection, sweetness, compassion and concern for the things or persons we are seeing. And if it comes from the soul's plane, it will be all Light, Delight and Peace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are some people who say they do not have any dreams at all, but they are mistaken. They do dream, but when they come out of the dreamland, they totally forget. Some people have the capacity to retain their dream-consciousness while they are fully awake early in the morning. If you feel that you had a dream at night but cannot remember it, then early in the morning try to concentrate on this particular point, at the back of the head, just at the top of the neck, When you have dreams, either they will manifest through your physical mind, or for some time, for a few hours or even for a day or two, they will be registered there. So if you want to recollect any dream, try to concentrate there. If you can concentrate there for ten or fifteen minutes, you will be able to feel that you are knocking at a particular door. And when the door opens, you will be able to remember your dreams completely. Everything will come back to you.</p>

Does it do any good to read books?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you read books for the interpretation of dreams, each book will give a different answer. Perhaps each book is right in its own way. But you have to get your own interpretation from your dreams. When you have a dream, try to feel your own existence in the dream; try to feel that you are inside the dream itself. Those who meditate daily will not find it difficult to do this, because when we meditate for ten or fifteen minutes in the morning or in the evening, we widen our consciousness.</p>
<p>Right now our consciousness is separated into three parts. At this moment we are in the waking consciousness. But when we sleep we will have another consciousness: sound sleep, deep sleep. Then we have a third consciousness: the dream state. But one who meditates widens his consciousness to embrace all three planes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it bad to pray to God for spiritual dreams?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it bad to pray to God for spiritual dreams?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not bad for an ordinary seeker to pray to God for spiritual dreams. Dreams are necessary, as experiences are necessary. But if you do not have dreams, if you do not have experiences, that does not mean that you are not fit for the spiritual life or that you are not fit for God-realisation. There are people who do not have any experiences. They curse themselves and think that God is displeased them. Far from it! God is most pleased with them. Suppose I want to reach a door. There are two ways of going. One way is to go there consciously. My calculating mind says that I have to take four or five steps to get there: one, two, three, four, five. Each step is a experience for me. If my physical mind wants to be convinced at every moment while I am walking toward my goal, then I can say that step one is an experience, step two is an experience, and so on. But again if I know that my destination is awaiting me, it may not be necessary for me to count each step or to have constant experiences each step of the way. What is necessary, in my case, is only my destination. I just go there and God is ready for me.</p>
<p>If you want to have dreams o experiences, they can serve as preparatory steps. But they are not necessary at all. The human mind always wants to be convinced and wants to get joy at every step when it does something. But if we live in the soul, in the heart, then we need not give that kind of importance to experiences and dreams. They are not necessary because God is preparing us in His own way. If He does not want to give us convincing experiences, no harm. But if we pray to God for convincing experiences or sweet dreams, there is no harm in our prayer. Eventually a day will come when we shall offer God the highest prayer: "O God, if You want, give me dreams. If You want, give me experiences. If You don't want to give me dreams or experiences, it is all up to You. Only make me worthy of Your Compassion. And if You don't want to make me worthy of Your Compassion, it is also up to You. Only do with me as You will. Let Thy Will be done in and through me. I care for nothing except for Your own fulfilment in and through me." When we have that kind of prayer within us, then God comes to us and says, "Do not be a beggar. Do not cry for dreams; do not cry for experiences. Take Me, the Reality itself."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have sweet dreams, inspiring dreams, then you should meditate most soulfully early in the morning — at 3:30 or 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. — and then go to sleep for about half an hour or forty minutes. If your meditation is sound and genuine, if it comes from the very depth of your heart, any dreams you have afterwards will be divine, significant dreams. They will be about angels and gods, or about your dear ones; or you will see some encouraging, inspiring things. If you want to have good dreams before 3:00 a.m., please try to meditate on your navel for about ten minutes at night before you go to bed. The navel is where emotion starts. Emotion itself is not bad; it is a question of how we use it. When we have human emotion, we only bind and bind. But when we have divine emotion we extend, we extend our consciousness. If you concentrate on your navel centre for ten minutes, you can bring the human emotion under control and allow the divine emotion to go up from the heart, upward to the highest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Last year when you were in India, I had a dream in which I heard distant music and I woke up and thought I was either dead or in Heaven.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Last year when you were in India, I had a dream in which I heard distant music and I woke up and thought I was either dead or in Heaven." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This was a most powerful experience that you received from the depth of your soul. The music that you heard is from the soul: This music cannot be appreciated by the outer ear; it has to be appreciated through our inner organ. In the ordinary life, when the lower vital or emotional vital does not appreciate or identify with something, immediately we feel that we are dead. When the body and vital do not appreciate the soul's music, they are dead to that kind of music that inspires and elevates our consciousness. So when the physical is separated from the soul — the soul's music, the soul's light — the physical is dead. It is not that you are dead, but when the unaspiring body does not accept the soul as its Source, then we feel that it is like a dead soldier, as good as dead, just as we say that whoever does not practice spiritual life is a dead soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In what plane of consciousness are our dreams?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In what plane of consciousness are our dreams?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dreams are on many different planes; it depends on the dream. There are various kinds of dreams. Some dreams take place in the vital plane. These dreams are very often confusing, because there is not much light in the vital, which is the world of enjoyment. In dreams from the vital world there are many sensations and great excitement. When we have dreams in the vital world, very often they soon take form in the physical world because it is the closest to the vital world. We may also have dreams in the world of the mind, the heart or the soul. In the higher worlds the dreams are luminous, but they have no sensations in them. When we have dreams in the higher regions, in the soul's world, they usually take a long time to manifest here in the gross physical.</p>
<p>If you tell me what kind of dreams you have, I will be able to tell you what plane of consciousness these dreams are from. Sometimes you will dream that you are flying like a bird or an airplane at your sweet will. You are dropping from rooftops and touching the earth, then rising up again. You may think that this dream is coming from the highest world, for if you are able to fly and others are not, this must mean that you are on a very high level. But these dreams are taking place only in the vital world. If you have dreams of peace and light, if your whole consciousness is inundated with Peace or Light or Beauty and you do not know where it is coming from — it just exists and you are existing inside it — then you have to know that this dream is taking place in the soul's region and not in the vital. Like this all dreams have their own plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What determines what we dream?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What determines what we dream?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner beings, your aspiration and the entire universe inside your spiritual heart determine what you dream. But if your aspiring heart is not big enough for you to identify with the universal Consciousness, then you will feel that things are coming from the outside. Your aspiring heart can be made bigger only through aspiration. There comes a time when the aspiring heart becomes one with another Heart, which is flooded with Light and Delight. That Heart holds even the universal Consciousness. It is this Heart that determines all dreams from the most significant to the most insignificant.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That prison is the prison of inconscience, where there is no light, no hope, nothing, absolutely nothing. The prison of inconscience is the land of destruction. You have come out of it just because inside you there is something very sincere, very soulful, very devoted. So the unconditional Blessings of the Supreme have entered into that inconscience and brought you back. You have come out of it because the divine Grace, the unconditional supreme Grace, has saved you. I tell you, even in that prison, if you had been conscious of me, if you had uttered my name, you would have been saved.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If in a dream we feel deep love for someone, how can we best carry detached love into our outer relationship?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If in a dream we feel deep love for someone, how can we best carry detached love into our outer relationship?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If in a dream we feel deep love for someone, we must try to know whether this love is an emotional love. If it is vital emotional love, then immediately we have to offer both our love and the object of our love to the Supreme in us. This kind of dream is like eating cake. First of all, we shall try not to eat the cake at all, because of the weight problem it will create for us. But if we find that we have to eat the cake, then we shall do so secretly. Outwardly we shall be afraid to eat the cake, because the world will see us and laugh at our greed. But the best thing is not to eat the cake at all, not even in secret. If inwardly we consciously do something wrong, then it is very difficult, almost impossible, to detach ourselves from it; therefore, we should always try to be fully alert so that in our dreams we do not do the things which we should not and would not do in our waking hours. How can we be aware in our dreams? We can be fully aware in our dreams by developing more and more conscious will power in our waking hours.</p>
