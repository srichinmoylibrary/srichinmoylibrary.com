<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take all religions as members of one family. In a family there are many members, and each one is entitled to have a different opinion. But they do know that they all belong to the same family. True religion is like a life-tree; it has many branches with countless flowers, fruits and leaves. When we deal with different parts of the life-tree, we see diverse opinions on world issues.</p>
<p>Each individual seeker views the Creator and the creation according to his own aspiration and level of development. What we need is light to illumine our inner and outer differences. It is through our oneness-life that we will walk, march and run to the Supreme. We must have appreciation for and sympathetic oneness with all religions in order to create a harmony that will spread throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>

God wants us to meditate to become God the divine Life.” Why do you not also include Abraham, Moses and Mohammed here?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You have written: “Sri Krishna meditated and became God the divine Light. Christ meditated and became God the divine Compassion. God wants us to meditate to become God the divine Life.” Why do you not also include Abraham, Moses and Mohammed here?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Indeed, Abraham, Moses and Mohammed were also God’s representatives on earth. God’s conscious servants are like a family with many members. Suppose there is a family with ten members, who are all endowed with exceptional musical talents. You happen to be one of the brothers, and you give preference to some of your brothers and sisters over others because of your own inner feelings. You are in no way saying that the ones you prefer are the only musicians in the family, whereas the others are not musicians at all. You are just more fond of some of your brothers and sisters than of others. Another person will give more importance to different members of the family. It is only that I like or love this person more, while you may like or love somebody else more. Each of us has our own inner feelings and preference.</p>
<p>Again, it is also true that even among talented musicians, all of them do not have the same extraordinary talents. All may be excellent players, but some are definitely more talented than others. Even God-realised Masters are not all of the same calibre. Right in front of you, let us say, is the God-realisation-tree. I may have come with greatest difficulty from a remote place to sit at the foot of the tree. Another person not only has come to the same tree but also has climbed up the tree to an appreciable height. A third person has climbed up the highest branches. He has reached the highest, but he is not coming down again since he is afraid of being devoured by the ignorance-tiger roaming around the foot of the tree. Then there is a fourth person who is very brave. Not only has he climbed up to the highest but he also has picked quite a few most delicious fruits and brought them down to the hungry truth-seekers and God-lovers who were watching him with utmost love, joy and admiration.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all four are definitely God-realised souls. The one who has reached the foot of the realisation-tree is a God-realised soul. The one who has climbed up to an appreciable height is a God-realised soul, and the one who has climbed up and then climbed down to share the fruits with others is also a God-realised soul. But in terms of God-manifestation, they are not the same.</p>

What do you think of the new religions that appear frequently in the United States, which stress social-life activities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right that my Hindu religion has been mercilessly tested throughout the centuries. Because of Hinduism’s vastness-heart and tolerance-life, it has survived and will continue to survive all inner and outer challenges. Hinduism encompasses many philosophies and beliefs. It is all-embracing in its love, and it gives importance to all the spiritual figures of the world. Hinduism embodies certain eternal ideals, and it sees a true harmony in the teachings of all religions. To some extent, it is more like a self-disciplined spiritual culture than a religion.</p>
<p>I am not well acquainted with the new religions that deal with social-life activities, so I am the wrong person to say anything about them. But I do hope they all are doing the right thing and aiming at the same goal — the goal of universal oneness.</p>

Are all religions ways to provide us with the experience of God, independent of the historical appearance of the religion’s message?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that I do not ask my disciples to leave their religions. To me, religions are like houses. Everyone has to live in a house. But if they want to study in a particular school, they can go outside their house. In the spiritual school they have the same teacher, and they all study the same lesson. What is the lesson they study? Love of God. And love of God is the essence of all religions.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe in one God, one Source. Love of God is like a tree — the life-tree — and it has many branches. Each of the branches has its own identity and its own name, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam and so forth. But they are still branches of the same tree.</p>
<p>Even in our human life we see that the same person is called various names by different people. You call your father ‘Dad’, whereas I will call him by his surname because I do not know him. Your father’s brothers and sisters will call him by his childhood name, and perhaps your mother will have her own affectionate nickname for him. So his dear ones call him by various names, and his friends and acquaintances also address him differently. But he is the same person. Similarly, people of different religions call God by different names, but it is the same Being that they are referring to.</p>
<p>I also believe that all religions are ways to provide us with the experience of God, completely independent of the historical context of their messages. True, each religious teacher or prophet comes with a special message that suits the people of his time. But humanity’s ignorance and lack of receptivity are such that whenever a prophet comes, he always seems to have come ahead of his time. When God sends a prophet, a Messiah, a great religious teacher, it is definitely in order to serve Him and manifest Him during that particular period. But even though the world does not appear to be ready to receive the message that he brings, that message still plays a special role in the earth-consciousness. The teachings of the Saviour Christ, for example, have guided, uplifted and illumined humanity for almost two thousand years, and they will continue to do so for centuries to come.</p>

How can we identify a true religion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What has to prevail in religion — reason, or the sentiment of the heart? How can we identify a true religion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In religion, the feeling of oneness-heart has to prevail, and nothing else. Religion is not a matter of reason. If we live in our oneness-heart, we will feel the essence of all religions, which is love of God. But if we live in the mind, we will only try to separate one religion from another and see how their ideologies differ. It is the heart that can have a true intuitive understanding of the height and breadth of all religions. It is the heart that sees and feels the inner harmony and oneness of all religions.</p>
<p>True religion has a universal quality. It does not find fault with other religions. False religions will find fault with other religions; they will say that theirs is the only valid religion and their prophet is the only saviour. But a true religion will feel that all the prophets are saviours of mankind. Forgiveness, compassion, tolerance, brotherhood and the feeling of oneness are the signs of a true religion.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your opinion of those religious sects which fight with other sects in the Name of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your opinion of those religious sects which fight with other sects in the Name of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel very sad when religious sects quarrel and fight in the Name of God. If they really love God, they will not kill others in His Name. Love means oneness. If we have oneness, how can we fight? We fight only because we do not feel love for others, because we have not yet transformed our ignorance into oneness-reality.</p>
<p>In our own being there are many members — the body, vital, mind, heart and soul — and we claim all of them as our own, very own. The body, too, has so many parts, but when we want to achieve something, all the parts work together. In exactly the same way, when we want to do something good for mankind, then all the religions can and should work together. All the world’s faiths — which differ in appearance but in essence are one — must work together.</p>
<p>Since we all have the same Source, we all have the same ultimate destination. No matter which path we take, eventually we will arrive at the same destination. Since “all roads lead to Rome,” and we are all heading ultimately to the same Source, it is ridiculous to fight against others who are following different roads. Some people may choose a very short and direct road, while others may take a longer route. Some may want to fly while others are content to walk, but the destination is the same.</p>
<p>When all religions work together, they can achieve something great and good for both God and humanity. It is the collective prayers and good will of the seekers and followers of all the world’s religions that will bring down the highest Love and Compassion from above. And it is only God’s Love and Compassion descending into humanity’s heart and life that can change the face and fate of the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I recognise Jesus Christ not only as an unparalleled prophet and the beloved Son of God but also as a supreme oneness-friend of mankind. What he did, what he is doing and what he will be doing is far beyond the domains of history, society and certain levels of spirituality.</p>
<p>As the beloved Son of God, Jesus Christ came into the world to become part and parcel of earth’s existence, and to transform its consciousness from human to divine. True, his mortal years numbered a mere thirty-three, but birthless and deathless is his immortal sacrifice for Heaven and earth.</p>
<p>As an unparalleled prophet, he offered the message of divine love and divine surrender to God’s Will. “Let Thy Will be done!” What could be a greater prayer than this? These words of the Saviour will echo and re-echo always inside the very depths of our hearts. To surrender unconditionally to our Lord Supreme is the very purpose of our existence; it is every soul’s ultimate mission on earth.</p>
<p>As the true oneness-friend of mankind, Jesus Christ flooded the earth-consciousness with Compassion and Forgiveness. His immortal prayer, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,” will forever draw down God’s Compassion and Forgiveness from above for the inwardly hungry and thirsty truth-seekers and God-lovers. Indeed, Jesus’ self-offering life and earth-illumining message will shine bright, brighter, brightest in the aspiring heart and God-loving life of humanity throughout Eternity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Saviour’s lofty utterance is at once beautiful, illumining and fulfilling. To be blessed means to be more in tune with God’s Compassion, Light and Will.</p>
<p>Let us say somebody comes to me and tells me that he has been to a garden that has many beautiful and fragrant flowers. While he is telling me about the garden, unconsciously or consciously he is injecting some light into my being. I am getting joy from the garden just because he is telling me about it. When I go there myself, I am able to enjoy the garden to the fullest extent. But the joy that I previously got from my friend definitely adds to the joy that I get from the garden itself. When he tells me about the garden, it is like he is giving me a dollar. When I go to the garden and see it myself, it is like getting one hundred dollars. So then I have one hundred and one dollars.</p>
<p>But if my friend tells me about the garden, and I say, “No, I can’t believe anything from him,” then it is only when I go there myself and see that what he says is true that I will get the joy that I deserve. But if I had believed him when he first told me about the garden, my total amount of joy would have been greater. His own joy, which he was so eager to share with me, would have entered into me and been added to the joy I got myself when I went personally to the garden. Then naturally I would have been happier.</p>
<p>I do believe in an individual approach to God. Each sincere approach ultimately leads to the goal. When we come to the Vatican to be blessed by the Holy Father, I may come by boat, you may come by plane, a third person may come by car and a fourth person may come on foot. Each one has used his own means to reach the goal, but the destination, which is flooded with infinite Light and Delight, is the same. Therefore, I give value to each and every individual approach, since all ultimately lead to the destination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the path of the heart? Is it love, peace, devotion, sentiment, meditation and religious practice? What more?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the path of the heart? Is it love, peace, devotion, sentiment, meditation and religious practice? What more?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To me the path of the heart means divine love, divine devotion and divine surrender. Human love means to bind and be bound. Human devotion is nothing other than attachment. Human surrender is like the forced surrender of a slave to the master. But divine love means to love God in the way God wants to be loved. Divine devotion means to serve God in the way God wants us to serve. Divine surrender means to make our will completely one with His Will.</p>
<p>We want to love God unconditionally in order to please Him in His own Way. We want to devote ourselves to God unconditionally in order to please Him in His own Way. We want to surrender our earth-bound will to His Heaven-free Will unconditionally in order to please Him and fulfil Him in His own Way. Everything has to be unconditional. This is the path of the heart.</p>
<p>The supreme message of the Saviour we have to apply to our everyday life: “Let Thy Will be done.” When we love God, devote ourselves to God and surrender to Him unconditionally, our finite ‘self’ grows into the Infinite in exactly the same way that a drop enters the ocean and becomes the ocean itself. When we become one with the Infinite, and claim it as our very own, then we can truthfully say that we ourselves <em>are</em> infinite.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Which is the most beautiful prayer: the prayer of praise and beseeching, where man sees God as omnipotent, or the prayer of acceptance — &quot;Thy Will be done&quot;?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Which is the most beautiful prayer: the prayer of praise and beseeching, where man sees God as omnipotent, or the prayer of acceptance — &amp;quot;Thy Will be done&amp;quot;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The prayer “Let Thy Will be done” is infinitely more beautiful, infinitely more illumining and infinitely more fulfilling than a prayer of praise and beseeching.</p>
<p>In our prayers, when we appreciate, admire and adore God’s infinite capacities and qualities, unconsciously or consciously we hope to get some blessingful reward or boon in return. In a sense it is like we are trying to flatter God, and in return we expect something.</p>
<p>But when we say, “Let Thy Will be done,” it means we have become fully aware of our measureless limitations, incapacities and ignorance, and are aware of God’s measureless Compassion, Concern and Love for us. Because of our fathomless ignorance, we admit that we do not know what is good for us. We realise we may ask for the wrong thing, which instead of helping or satisfying us will only make us miserable. So we ask our divine Father, who loves us infinitely more than we love ourselves, to take control of our lives and make the decisions for us.</p>
<p>When we humbly offer our earth-bound will to God’s Heaven-free Will, we feel that we are a tiny drop entering into the boundless ocean and becoming inseparably one with the ocean. The ultimate goal of each seeker is to achieve infinite Peace, infinite Light and infinite Bliss, and this can be done only by fulfilling and pleasing God the Omniscient, God the Omnipotent and God the Omnipresent in His own Way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the development of the individual. These are extremely lofty spiritual goals. The Christ said, “I and my Father are one.” Is there any sincere truth-seeker and God-lover who will disagree with his illumining realisation? But if an ordinary person who does not pray and meditate or lead a spiritual life says this, nobody will take him seriously. A thief can tell me not to steal, but will I be inspired by his words? But if a saint or a great spiritual Master tells me not to steal, it is entirely different. When a spiritual Master asks me to do something, he is consciously putting a force behind his words so that I will succeed. He not only inspires me but also helps me inwardly to succeed.</p>
<p>When a spiritual aspirant has become inseparably one with the highest Absolute and knows that he has become a real instrument of God’s transcendental Will, he is entitled to say that he has become like God, or even that he is one with God or that he has become another God. When the tiny drop has merged into the ocean and become part and parcel of the ocean, you cannot tell it apart. Similarly, if an individual becomes one with the universe on the strength of his aspiration and realisation, at that time it is absolutely true to say that the finite has become the Infinite.</p>
<p>I am very grateful that you have read my writings. My philosophy is founded upon love, devotion and surrender. The message of love, devotion and surrender comes from the spiritual heart and finds its fulfilment in the universal oneness-heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does the Pope represent to you personally? You have met with Pope Paul Vl. Did you have any significant inner experiences? What did you talk about?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does the Pope represent to you personally? You have met with Pope Paul Vl. Did you have any significant inner experiences? What did you talk about?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To me, the Pope is a supreme leader of humanity. He is the elder brother of awakened and unawakened mankind. He is the representative of the Saviour Christ on earth. In my first meeting with Pope Paul VI, I told him that I saw in him “the most benevolent Father of the Catholic world, the Master-leader of the Christian world and the Champion-lover of humanity.” This is in essence what the role of the Pope represents to me.</p>
<p>I was fortunate and blessed to be able to meet with Pope Paul VI three times. Each time I met with him, I had significant inner experiences. When I looked at his eyes, I saw an illumination-sky, and when I entered into his heart, I felt a compassion-ocean. It is very rare to find an illumined mind and a compassionate heart together, but in one frame Pope Paul VI definitely embodied both compassion and illumination in boundless measure. I also discovered in him a soul’s smile which was truly psychic, yet touched with a subtle sadness. He had the capacity to quickly penetrate the human heart and dispel the sufferings of human life.</p>
<p>I remember so vividly the first time I met with His Holiness in a private audience. At one point he said, “This meeting of ours has been most essential.” He also told me, “I admire your philosophy — the Hindu life and the Christian life shall go together. Your message and my message are the same.” Later, I was deeply moved when the Pope said, “When we leave this world, you and I will meet together.” And the Holy Father was all kindness in presenting me with the Papal medallion.</p>
<p>The second time we met, I was fortunate enough to be in the front row when the Pope was holding a public audience. He was not physically well and had to be carried on a chair to the podium. After his talk, he came over to me, and again he was extremely compassionate. He told me that he had read and enjoyed the books that I had given him during our first meeting, and he appreciated my activities and selfless service at the United Nations. As you know, I have been leading meditations for delegates and staff there since 1970. The pope told me, “I am truly proud of your service to the United Nations. You are an Indian. I am also proud of your country.”</p>
<p>The third time we met, His Holiness granted me another private audience. This time I presented him with a book I had written about him, and he was very happy and pleased with it. When he looked through the book and saw the picture of U Thant and myself, he asked if I bring down new inspiration and aspiration from above when I conduct meditations at the United Nations. I answered, “Holy Father, I do try to bring down all the divine qualities with my prayers and meditations.” Again, he was full of kindness and compassion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have great admiration for the Catholic Church, in the same way that I appreciate our Hindu temples in India. To me, the Church embodies inspiration, aspiration and devotion in the purest sense of the terms. To me, each Catholic church, like a Hindu temple, is a heart-garden flooded with purity and divinity. It carries humanity's aspiration to the highest and brings down God's Compassion to humanity. You can say that the Church is the golden bridge between man's aspiration-cry and God's Satisfaction-Smile.</p>
<p>So I do not look upon the Catholic Church as merely an institution with various dogmas and moral laws. From my own spiritual point of view, I feel that the Church embodies God's sleepless and self-giving Breath for the illumination, salvation and perfection of mankind. In this sense, God has been working in and through the Holy Father and the Church to expedite humanity's inner and outer growth and progress, and to fulfil humanity's aspirations for inner and outer freedom and liberation.</p>
