  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we proceed and make inner progress in the spiritual life if we get light and joy from more than one Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we proceed and make inner progress in the spiritual life if we get light and joy from more than one Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you have to know that each Master is like a doctor. If you have a headache, you will go to a doctor, who will give you some medicine and cure you. Again, if you have some other ailment — say, foot pain — you will go to a foot specialist and he will cure you. But if you see that there is someone who has the power to cure you no matter what ailment you have, if there is someone who can enter into the root of all diseases, then naturally you will go to that person. If there is a doctor who will be able to give you so much Light that you will never suffer from any disease again, then you will go to him. So if you see a Master in whom you have implicit faith, and if you feel that he will be able to guide you until you have reached your destination, you will go to this Master and not go to any other Master.</p>
<p>It is like going to school. Some Masters will be able to teach only kindergarten, or only primary school, or only high school courses. Again, there are some Masters who will be able to teach you right from the beginning to the end — from the kindergarten level right up to the Ph.D. If you see a Master who can guide you right from the journey's start to the journey's destination, then you will go to that one. Otherwise, you will go to one who has the capacity to teach you at your level of spiritual development. Then, after a couple of years, perhaps you yourself will surpass him, and you will have to look for someone else to guide you for another couple of years. Then once again you will see that your inner progress has far surpassed your Master's realisation. This has happened in many, many cases. So again you have to look for a new Master.</p>
<p>Each time you go to a new Master, you waste time. Each one has a special way of teaching and you have to adapt yourself to the new way. One has taught you a particular truth and given you a specific way to reach it. The next one is giving you a higher truth, but he may not ask you to walk along the road where you have already made some progress. He may take you along a totally different road. He may take you to a farther destination, but he may also take you along a different road. So when you start along a different road, you may be bewildered or puzzled and it may create problems for you.</p>
<p>So if you get someone in whom you have implicit faith and confidence, and if you feel that he will be able to guide you, not only at your present level of consciousness but until you have reached your highest destination, then you should go to that person. He will show you how to walk along Eternity's road and also help you walk along the road. It is not his road but the road that he has discovered, that he is well acquainted with. In that case, it is advisable to walk along with that Master who, from the beginning to the end, can show you, teach you and guide you along one road to your highest Goal. Otherwise, you will just waste time going from one Master to another.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have read in the Bible that if one does not accept the teachings of Jesus Christ, his soul is damned forever to hell. Is this true?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have read in the Bible that if one does not accept the teachings of Jesus Christ, his soul is damned forever to hell. Is this true?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My simple answer to this question is that it is up to you whether you believe or do not believe. If you believe that you must have faith only in the Christ's teachings, then you must pray to the Christ-Consciousness to illumine you. However, if you do not believe this, then you have a perfect right to do what you feel is best. It is your inner being that will tell you whether to believe or not to believe. But if you accept the theory that you are damned to hell if you do not have absolute faith in Christ, then naturally you have to pray to the Christ-Consciousness to illumine and perfect you. I personally say that the Consciousness of the Christ, the Buddha, Sri Krishna, Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo and other great Masters is all the same Consciousness known under different names. But it is up to you to decide what to believe.</p>
<p>Heaven and hell are inside our mind. They are a state of consciousness, not a country to which one goes. If you cherish a good thought, then inside that good thought is Heaven. If you treasure a bad thought, you live in hell. Heaven and hell are inside us; at every moment we experience either Heaven or hell. Heaven gives joy; hell gives a painful experience. We are responsible for every thought. If we cry to God for Light, that is a good thought, and we get illumining experiences from good thoughts. If we do not cry for Light, then we experience a painful reality, which we call hell.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Was the battle of Kurukshetra a real battle, or was it the symbol of the battle of life on earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Was the battle of Kurukshetra a real battle, or was it the symbol of the battle of life on earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The battle of Kurukshetra was a real battle. It did take place over four thousand years ago. Krishna was there in human form; Arjuna was there. It is absolutely true; Krishna did come into existence and it was a real battle.</p>
<p>But now we use it according to our own purpose. When we are in a position to use the message of the Gita in a practical way, we say, "Yes, Krishna did come." But the message of disinterested work — that we work for the sake of work, but offer the result at the Feet of the Lord — is very difficult for human beings. So we say it is all symbolic; it is all theory. It is not reality. But for spiritual people, everything is reality. For ordinary people, unaspiring people, everything will be imaginary or theoretical or just symbolic, with no reality in it. But for spiritual people, everything that the Gita says is reality.</p>
<p>The battle of Kurukshetra was real, and this battle is taking place every day deep within us between the divine forces and the undivine forces in us. Since we are seekers, ultimately the divine forces within us will gain victory. Also in the case of the Gita, the Pandavas did win the battle. If we are not seekers, the undivine forces will go on winning and keeping us under their control. But since we are seekers, we are bound to conquer our undivine, hostile, unaspiring forces. In the battlefield of life, we are bound to win because we are aspiring.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is done devotedly and soulfully, then it is directly reaching the Heart of the Supreme. But it has to be soulful, and not something done out of compulsion; not outer compulsion, but inner necessity. Your family is part and parcel of your life, and to please them devotedly and soulfully is to please the divinity within them. But it has to be done with the feeling that they are your very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This planet Earth is the world of evolution. Whether we are realised or not, it is here that we evolve; it is here that we make progress. The other place, Heaven, is the resting place. Here we earn, as when we go to the office to make our salary. Then, when we go home, we do what we want. Heaven is rest, but not in the human sense. Far from it. Heaven is rest in the divine sense.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of heart: the human heart and the universal heart. The human heart is a muscle. It functions while we are living, and when we die it stops functioning. The divine heart houses God the Universal Consciousness. The soul is the divine spark inside us. The soul is the link between God and us. There are two kinds of spirit. One spirit is part of the earthly existence; it is an unsatisfied soul. In the other sense, Spirit is transcendental Existence. The first kind of spirit wants to stay or remain on earth and bring messages from the vital world. This is all done in the vital world. The other Spirit is the transcendental Existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day you have to pray most soulfully and try to go deep within and hear the message. The deeper you go, the more Light, the more sense of oneness and the more self-confidence you will achieve. Eventually you will feel that God needs you for manifestation as much as you need Him for realisation. So try to go deep within. The message is not something you get from the outside. Sow the seed of love within your heart and it will grow into a love-tree. Each time you meditate, dig deep within, as though you are sowing seeds. The seeds will germinate and then you will know and please the Supreme in His own Way. The answer is always within. There is only one question: "Who am I?" On the strength of my oneness with God, I am everything. Otherwise, I am nothing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the present role of humanity in the manifestation of God&#039;s Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the present role of humanity in the manifestation of God&#039;s Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Humanity is composed of human beings. Here each individual has to feel the supreme necessity of the manifestation of divine Light. Once we become sincere seekers, we try consciously, devotedly and soulfully to become divine instruments of God. We become divine instruments through our constant inner cry. A child cries. He may be on the first floor while his mother is on the third floor, but she will come running to feed him. If I want to become a divine instrument, I must cry soulfully, devotedly and consciously. We cry to go up and then, when the Light descends, we smile. In order to ascend we cry soulfully; when the Light descends and divinity dawns on us, we smile soulfully.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker is he who has made friends with eternal time in the soul's world. If he refuses or wastes one second of God's time, manifestation is delayed. It is God's Will to manifest in and through him, and if the seeker is sincere, he will try to manifest God's Perfection. Again, we have to know there is something known as God's Hour. Before that Hour we shall do our best; we shall pray and meditate. Everything that is to be done we shall do. We shall make friends with wisdom-light, show our concern for mankind, make our life a sacrifice-flood. Everything we shall do to make ourselves ready. If we haven't yet reached the goal, we don't feel sad; we aspire. Then, when the Hour comes, we can run the fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually blue has transcendence. Any colour can have transcendence, but not brown or black. Black has the inner tendency to fight, but by fighting, what is going to be transcended? Only things which want to expand have transcendence. Blue always wants to expand. From dark blue it goes to pale blue, sky blue. From a dark colour it gradually transcends, transcends until we get the feeling there is only Infinity.</p>

But I&#039;m not always sure whether it comes from the mental or the vital." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will be the best judge. But if you get satisfaction, that is more than enough. If you get real satisfaction, you don't have to worry about whether it is coming from the mind or the vital. Let us take the planes of consciousness as the floors of a building. Right now you do not have free access to the building. There are quite a few floors. But when you make considerable progress in the spiritual life, a day will come when you will be able to know which floor, which plane, these experiences are coming from. Whether it is the vital plane, the psychic plane, the mental plane, the over-mind, the higher mind, the intuitive mind — easily you will be able to know. But as long as you get joy, try to claim this joy. You don't have to know from which floor the experiences are coming. Continue creating. That is the right thing. As long as you claim divine satisfaction from the creation, that is sufficient. You don't have to know everything in minor detail. Just see the reality. If you want to become an expert, you have to realise God. When you are aiming at God-realisation, don't worry about the minor things that come along the way. As long as you are satisfied, it is more than enough.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can increase our own dedication by constant practice. If we dedicate ourselves to God, say, five minutes a day, then let us increase it to ten minutes, half an hour, two or three hours. But we have to do it soulfully. It is not enough just to increase the time; we have to know that soulful prayer should be our aim. Every day, when we dedicate our lives to the higher Goal, the higher cause or the divinity within us, we have to be extremely soulful. And if we are really soulful, then we increase the power of our receptivity and capacity in our life of dedication.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we increase our will-power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we increase our will-power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of will-power. One type of will-power we get from the third eye. Tremendous will-power we get if we concentrate here. The other type of will-power is from the heart. From here also we get intense will-power. Again, if we concentrate around our navel, there is a kind of will-power that we get, but that will-power is destructive; we cannot use it for a good purpose. This will-power comes from the vital world, and if we are not totally purified in our vital, especially in the lower vital, we may misuse this will-power. But if the navel centre is purified, then the will-power we get from there will be used for a divine purpose.</p>
<p>The will-power we have inside the heart is the soul's power. That power we can never use for a wrong purpose. The safest of the three is the will-power that comes from the heart. When you pray and meditate, try to feel that there is already some power inside, deep inside your heart, which has to be brought to the fore. Will-power from the navel centre we can use for good purposes and bad purposes, for constructive and destructive ends; but will-power from the heart can only be utilised for good. It is very fast, like a bullet. When we use the will-power from the navel centre, it will be very deep and electrifying, but in the heart's will-power there is motherly affection, concern. Tremendous will is there, but the mother's will is also full of love and compassion. Will-power from the third eye will be like the father's will-power. There will be concern, but wisdom will also be there.</p>
<p>The easiest way to use will-power is to take the positive approach. Use will-power to do something positive, not to keep yourself from doing something negative. If we say, "I shall not tell a lie," that is important. But if we say, "I shall tell the truth," that will-power is more effective. When we say, "I won't do it," already the negative thing has half its power just because we are thinking about it. If we repeat in our mind, "I won't be jealous," the word 'jealous', the negative quality that it embodies, ruins our mind and then we do become jealous. If we say, "I won't be doubtful," the word 'doubt' enters into our mind and automatically doubt comes. But if we say, "From now on, I shall be totally devoted to God. I shall be faithful. I shall be fully surrendered," these words are very good. Surrender and faith and devotion are very good. If we all the time have positive feeling, and make positive assertions, then automatically our will-power increases.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music and spirituality go together. God Himself is the Supreme Musician and each human being is a note in His cosmic Game. God is playing His cosmic Role in mankind through music. Through His music, God is offering to His children the message of unity in multiplicity and also the message of multiplicity in unity. When we play soulful music, we elevate our consciousness most rapidly. Soulful music is a form of aspiration, a form of meditation. But if we play undivine music, then it destroys our aspiring consciousness. All those who are seekers of the infinite Truth will naturally play soulful music; and when they play soulful music, they have to know that they are consciously running towards their destined goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is the invocation of some higher force or higher reality into the lower part of our existence. The higher and lower parts are both ours, but the higher realities which we try to bring down during meditation are conscious of their oneness with God, whereas the lower realities in us are not aware of it. When we meditate, we invoke the higher realities to enter into the lower realities and make them feel that they also belong to God. So meditation is the invocation of our higher part into our lower part in order to illumine and convince the lower that it can also eventually be as good, as divine, as perfect as the higher in us, provided it receives the light that is descending from above. Then, when the lower realities are illumined properly, they will be able to claim God the same way the higher realities claim God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You said we can increase our purity by repeating &#039;Aum&#039; five hundred times a day. But for me to repeat &#039;Aum&#039; five hundred times a day is very difficult. Can you advise me what to do?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You said we can increase our purity by repeating &#039;Aum&#039; five hundred times a day. But for me to repeat &#039;Aum&#039; five hundred times a day is very difficult. Can you advise me what to do?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is difficult for you to do it at one stretch, then you can do it in pieces. You can do it ten times; each time you will repeat it only fifty times. You know that during the day you want to drink ten glasses of water. But if you drink all ten glasses of water at once, you are afraid it will upset your stomach; so you won't drink them all at once. But if you drink one glass now and then after an interval of an hour or two, another glass, easily you can drink ten glasses of water. So here also, instead of chanting 'Aum' five hundred times all at once, early in the morning you can repeat it fifty times. Then, in an hour's time, you try another fifty. So each hour if you repeat 'Aum' fifty times, each time it won't take you more than a minute or two. Since you can easily spend two minutes in an hour, you can do it. If you have a mantra or incantation of your own, you can easily do it fifty times an hour. It cannot take more than two or three minutes, and everyone can offer three minutes to God. It is not how many hours you can do it at a time that is important, but how soulfully you can do it.</p>
<p>When you chant 'Aum', please feel that life-energy, divine energy, is entering into you through your crown centre. The breath that you breathe in through the nose is very limited; but if you can imagine that there is a big hole in the top of your head and that life-energy, cosmic energy, is entering into your body through that big hole, then naturally you will be able to accelerate your purification and increase your aspiration and hunger for God, Truth, Light and Bliss.</p>
