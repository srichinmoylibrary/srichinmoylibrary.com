<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three ways. The first way is called japa, which is the incantation or repetition of a word or mantra. Then comes meditation. Then there is prayer.</p>
<p>Our best mantra is Aum. When we repeat it, it becomes japa. Kindly chant Aum most soulfully. Then while meditating. please don't allow any thought to enter; only feel that you are inside me, or inside the Himalayas, climbing high, higher, highest. When you do prayer, please try to feel that there is no competition at all in the spiritual life. Please try to do your best and feel that each individual is responsible for the best achievement, the best progress. Feel that today is your day and if you do well, the Supreme will be extremely pleased.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Towards the end of the meditation there are two things that I usually do. When I stand up and look at the seekers, I give them my last self-offering. This last self-offering is an inner shower, an inner rain. My soul brings down God's Compassion, especially His Compassion-Delight, from above. During the last few minutes I actually grow into a torrential rain. I literally see myself as rain. Only this rain does not create problems for the seekers. On the contrary, it helps them run as fast as they want.</p>
<p>When I put on the garland, it is not in any way an act of demonstration. I do not take it because I have worked very hard in the battlefield of life and deserve it. No, this garland I take as a garland of gratitude. I place it around my neck only to show that this garland is not mine: this garland is yours. I happen to be there acting as a leader, playing the role of the leader. You can say a self-imposed leader, if you want. But this leader is only receiving the garland on behalf of the group. During the meditation each individual member has added to the leader's self-offering. So I wear this garland on behalf of all the seekers. I am also a seeker. Although only one garland is at our disposal, this leader knows perfectly well that it is everybody's. I take the garland as a token of my gratitude to each of you, to the Supreme in each individual seeker.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are outer gestures important for aspiration to increase?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are outer gestures important for aspiration to increase?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some outer gestures are useful for seekers. You have put candles, incense and flowers in the meditation room to increase your aspiration. They will not increase my aspiration, for I have already realised God. If you are going to realise God tomorrow or in two years, then for you also, these outer things will have no value. These flowers, candles and incense have no value for realised souls or for seekers on the verge of realisation. But if you know that God-realisation is still a far cry, then these things will definitely increase your aspiration. When you are in a very high spiritual mood and you fold your hands, you are not folding your hands to me or touching my feet. No, when you fold your hands you are bowing to your own aspiring self. Let us consider the body as two halves, a lower and a higher part. Your lower half wants to become one with the higher half. Although I represent both the higher and lower selves, just because of my realisation I am well-established in the higher world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you are not yet well-established in the higher world. But even though I am in the higher world, if I take off my legs and only my upper portion remains, and then if I want to stand, I will not be able to. I need my lower part just as much as I need my higher part. I need them equally for illumination, I have to have constant communication and oneness between my higher and lower parts. When you fold your hands with an immediate inner feeling, your lower self is becoming one with your higher self. Then there is a continuous, sweet feeling, like a river flowing into the ocean.</p>
<p>The seeker is the river, and the Master is the ocean. The natural course of the river is to flow into the ocean. Then it will become the ocean. But if the river does not feel that it must merge with the ocean, then even if it sees the ocean it will take a wrong course or just meander aimlessly. The seeker has to feel that he is a river, and that the goal of the river is to flow the fastest and enter into the ocean. The seeker must recognise the necessity to enter into the Master. It should be with this kind of feeling that you fold your hands to meditate facing the disciples.</p>
<p>Tonight I selected some disciples who had good meditations. Do you think that I selected all those who had folded their hands during meditation? Far from it. There were only one or two who had folded their hands. There are many who have not folded their hands today whom I selected. Again there are many who were sitting in front of me folding their hands whom I did not select.</p>
<p>If you fold your hands soulfully, it will help you meditate better, but you don't have to do it at all. There are some who do not fold their hands soulfully, but only make their hands very stiff, as if they are going to press something together or break it. That kind of devotion is no devotion at all.</p>
<p>Some disciples feel as if they have one hundred dollars from their inner aspiration but their goal is one hundred and one. They need one dollar more in order to reach the destined goal. They feel that folding their hands helps because they know it may give them that last dollar they need to reach the goal. Others feel that they don't need to fold their hands. They feel that by increasing their aspiration they will automatically get the last dollar. They are right. But the first group feels that if there is something outwardly they can do which will immediately give them that one dollar more, they will do it.</p>
<p>Most fold their hands only when I turn towards them, and the rest of the time they do not fold their hands. There are some who are doing so not because I am looking at them, but because their inner being is telling them to fold their hands at that time. When I meditate on them, they feel that their aspiration has increased its intensity, it has now become greater, so they fold their hands. In this way they are doing it soulfully and spontaneously.</p>
<p>Otherwise, by folding your hands you can deceive yourself, you can deceive the friends around you for one day, two days, three days, two months or six months. Then your own sincerity will come forward. Something within you will pinch you and tell you either to fold your hands only when you are sincere and spiritual and when you feel it is necessary, or to stop folding your hands. Your own inner sincerity will enter you like a bullet and say you are deceiving yourself, you are deceiving others. But by deceiving, you are not getting real aspiration.</p>
<p>Again, just because you were folding your hands out of deception and now have realised your folly, that doesn't mean you should necessarily stop folding your hands. It is like curiosity. Some people enter into the spiritual life out of curiosity. They do not have sincere inspiration or aspiration, but out of curiosity they come to meetings and join the activities. Finally they see that their curiosity is getting them nowhere. The seekers around them have true aspiration, and they are gaining something inwardly and outwardly. At that time they want to stop their life of curiosity and they begin to sincerely aspire.</p>
<p>I often say that when you have to make a choice between idleness and ego, aggrandisement of ego is better than idleness. When you give importance to the ego, at least you start to do something. In the spiritual life also, if you fold your hands out of curiosity or even to show off, for two or three months you may do it. Then even if your own sincerity does not come forward, you may overhear two of your friends or enemies saying, "Oh, see what he does," and you will be embarrassed. If you are embarrassed, then you will stop it, or you will do it sincerely.</p>
<p>Today if you are waiting to get inspiration, or high aspiration, you don't have to fold your hands. When it comes from within, then you will fold your hands. That is absolutely the correct thing. If you are not getting aspiration for months and yet you fold your hands in a false way, somebody will come forward and criticise you. You will say, "How can he criticise me? It is beneath my dignity to be criticised by him or by her. Let me now do the right thing." To go through this process is one way to resolve the issue of folding hands. Of course, that is not the best way. The best way is to fold your hands only when it comes spontaneously from within.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Most disciples fold their hands when you are meditating and looking at them. But sometimes when I am meditating with you this doesn&#039;t come naturally. Is it all right not to fold our hands while you are looking at us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Most disciples fold their hands when you are meditating and looking at them. But sometimes when I am meditating with you this doesn&#039;t come naturally. Is it all right not to fold our hands while you are looking at us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Folding your hands should always be spontaneous. It should never be an outer show. It will be wrong if just as I look at you, you fold your hands and as soon as I look at the next person, you drop them. This is just like a mischievous boy. When the teacher comes, the clever student pretends to be working and as soon as the teacher looks to the other side, the student misbehaves. That is very bad. If I am looking at somebody else and then I turn to you, if you suddenly fold your hands and it is not spontaneous, then you are not getting anything from it.</p>
<p>But again, there are some disciples who are by nature very good, extremely devoted. They know that they cannot always remain in their highest, on the peak. They feel that when the Master looks at them, they get additional inner joy, thrill, confidence and enthusiasm. If there is anything they have not done which may further elevate their consciousness, then they will do it. They feel that if this outward gesture, folding their hands, is done soulfully, it definitely increases their aspiration.</p>
<p>In some instances you may even have a better meditation when I am looking at someone else than when I am looking at you. I may be looking at someone else who is receiving according to his capacity and receptivity. At that time, if you feel that you are in your highest consciousness and if you look at me, like a magnet you can pull my light. Although I am looking at somebody else, more of my light can be going to you than to him. On the other hand, while I am concentrating on you, perhaps you are thinking that all the other disciples are looking at you. Or your mind may be counting how many seconds I am looking at you and comparing this with how long I looked at others. So, if you fold your hands, it has to be spontaneous. If it is spontaneous, it adds to your aspiration. If it is not spontaneous, it is a useless outer gesture.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can we tune in to the particular quality that you are bringing down most in your meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it is quite noticeable to the outer eye whether I am bringing down power or peace. Sometimes it is not, because while I am bringing down one aspect of divinity, such as peace, inside the peace there is also power or solid strength, or inside power there is peace. Again, sometimes everything comes but only one aspect is noticeable to the human eye.</p>
<p>Now, how will you identify yourself with the most prominent quality? Do not use the mind, do not use the eyes but inwardly become one with the quality. You have to use the heart to feel it, not the eyes to see it. You should keep your eyes open — otherwise you may fall asleep-and use the heart to identify yourself with what you are seeing. If you see the beauty of a flower and enjoy its fragrance and you want to feel the essence of the flower inside your heart, you will not be able to feel it if you are only exercising the capacity of your nose and your eyes. Here you are not letting the heart exercise its capacity. You have seen and smelled the flower but you also have to grow into the flower which is full of beauty and purity. So, you are not the nose, you are not the eyes, you are the heart. The inner heart will immediately bring to the fore the essence and substance of the flower itself and you will become one with the flower. So, after you have seen a quality during your meditation, do not mentally say that it is power or delight. Just become that quality by using your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you look at me, my consciousness registers in your physical world. If you don't look at me, often you fall fast asleep and enter into the dream world. There you do something but you can't account for it. During conscious meditation, if you receive, then the mind is convinced and you feel something very sublime. When you dream, you get something but because its existence is in the inner world, you don't value it. I insist that people look at me from time to time because then my being registers in the mind. If you see the source, you know you are getting something. Otherwise, if you stand with your eyes closed in front of the ocean, you don't see or feel that you are receiving anything.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to assimilate what you receive from meditation. If you do not assimilate these qualities, then it is almost useless. Then the next day you have to go again and get the same amount of peace, light and bliss. Once something is assimilated, it becomes a solid realisation, an absolutely permanent experience. Then it is not only a conscious part of you, but also inseparably one with your existence. This is very important. There is a great difference between when we assimilate our meditation and when we do not.</p>
<p>If peace, light and bliss are not assimilated, then it is as if a friend came into your life for a few hours and then he just left you after a short time. He did not become your eternal friend or your lifelong friend.</p>
<p>If you don't establish an eternal friendship, you do not give your friend the opportunity to be with you, to inspire you, to guide you, to mould you and shape you, or to share any divine qualities or capacities with you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any way to evaluate the result of our meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any way to evaluate the result of our meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are two ways. One way is to ask the Master if the meditation has been really deep and profound. Sometimes it happens that when a seeker feels that he has had the highest meditation, it may not be true. At that time it is always advisable to ask the Master to evaluate one's meditation. If the Master is not available or if the Master is not in the physical, then the seeker has to evaluate the meditation in two ways. If the seeker feels enormous joy and compares this with the previous joy that he has felt when he has had a good meditation, and if the intensity of the joy far surpasses the previous intensity, then he has to feel that this time his meditation has gone higher.</p>
<p>The other way to evaluate one's meditation, which is absolutely the best way, is to see if, right after meditating, one feels totally detached from the joy itself. The seeker has to take the joy as an incident or an experience. No matter how deep or how shallow the meditation was, if he can detach himself totally from the joy or any divine quality he experienced and make his vessel, which we call receptivity, larger and deeper, then he is preparing himself for a higher and deeper experience. Whatever he has got is wonderful but he must not stay with the incident or experience that he received. If he can prepare himself for a higher journey, a higher experience, then that means he has gone one step higher through his meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are giving something or helping people, that is not necessarily dedication. Dedication means feeling my conscious presence. While you are doing your work, if at that time you feel my conscious presence, that is called dedication. That kind of dedication is a form of meditation. But sometimes, because of your own ego, you want to help somebody — you may feel that you have some capacity to inspire this person — but you may not be able to see my presence inside him. At that time, you have to know that you are only aggrandising your ego by feeling that you have more inner wealth than the other person. But if you are doing something and, at the same time, if you are feeling my presence in the work itself, then that dedication is real meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely not. But if you just keep your eyes open and look at me, then naturally you are not sleeping. When you see something, you get inspiration. From inspiration you go to aspiration and from aspiration you go to realisation. Only when your eyes are closed are you enjoying sleep.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do I sometimes feel sad when I come out of meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do I sometimes feel sad when I come out of meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate, please do not have any preconceived ideas. Do not think about whether you will receive pain or joy. Do not act like a beggar. Feel that you are doing the right thing, and when you come out of meditation, feel that that is the proper time for you to come out of meditation. When you are going high, higher, highest, there is no reason why you should doubt yourself. While you are climbing up a tree, if you know that you are climbing up a tree, you don't doubt the act of climbing. You are climbing a tree and you know that you are going high. When you are sure that you are climbing up high, higher, highest, then there is nothing to doubt.</p>
<p>When you come out of your meditation, if you feel sorry, then you have to feel that you are making a mistake. You want to remain up in the tree and eat the ripe mango to your heart's content. You don't want to bring it down and distribute it to mankind, to your brothers and sisters who are hungry.</p>
<p>So when you go up, you have to feel the necessity of going up to the highest to collect the mangoes and bringing them down. You are bringing them down and they are meant for distribution. But if you come down and you feel sad, that means you want to eat them all by yourself upstairs. You don't want to have to bring them down. You will act like an ordinary person in a very miserly way.</p>
<p>So the best thing is, when you go up, always to go with joy and when you come down, also to come down with joy. When you go up, feel that it is for achievement of the highest and when you come down or come out of meditation, feel that it is for distribution.THE HOUR OF MEDITATION</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we meditate in the evening or at other times during the day, is it as beneficial as meditating early in the morning?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If we meditate in the evening or at other times during the day, is it as beneficial as meditating early in the morning?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, some of you meditate in the evening instead of in the morning. You say that in the evening your meditation is deep and profound. I don't deny it, only I wish to say that I believe the morning shows the day. Sometimes the morning may be cloudy and then afterwards the sun peeps out, but usually when the morning is clear, the whole day is bright. So if you start your spiritual life early in the morning, then you will go very fast. If you are very tired and exhausted because you have gone to bed late, my fervent request to each of you is to get up at your specific hour and meditate, and then go to bed again and make friends with sleep. But please meditate each morning regularly and punctually. Some of you meditate at lunch hour or in the office when you have a coffee break. That is excellent. But please do morning meditation also. Once you do the right thing early in the morning, then automatically you will be able to flow towards the sea like a river. Feel in the morning that you are a river. The very nature of a river is to flow and enter into the ocean. Here the ocean is the Supreme.</p>
<p>Now some disciples tell me that early in the morning it is very cold and they can't leave their bed and sit in front of the shrine. I sympathise with them, but what can I do? Such wonderful disciples I have-for various reasons they find it difficult to get up. To those disciples who said it was cold I said, "Please just sit on your bed; that is your shrine. Only do me a favour and just wash your eyes, your face and your nose; you don't have to take a proper shower. Then if you can put my picture in front of you while meditating, if you can look at my Transcendental picture, then that is enough. But please do not meditate while lying down. If you try to meditate while lying down, I will not be responsible for that meditation."</p>
<p>When one becomes a great spiritual Master, he has a kind of sleep called "yogic sleep." Even if my body appears to be asleep and everybody can hear me snoring from a distance, I will be able to prove to you later that I knew what was happening there in the room while I was asleep. When one realises God, he can do many things at a time. Once someone came into my room when I was sleeping. Later I told him, "I can tell you everything that happened. You stood in that corner, opened the window and so forth." I was snoring, but I was conscious at that time. Here I wish to say I can do many, many things at a time. But in your case, when you meditate, you have to be very careful and sit up and meditate. You don't want to sleep; you want to swim in the sea of light and delight.</p>
<p>To me, each seeker is a miracle because the same person could have stayed in ignorance. Out of countless people, you get up early in the morning and cry for God while your relatives and friends are still sleeping in the world of ignorance. If you are not the greatest miracle, who is? Out of billions of people in the world, you want to realise God and you get up and pray. You could have easily joined your friends or neighbours who are still sleeping, but you have got up to pray and meditate.</p>

Has the effort of doing this caused any general improvement in our consciousness during the day?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some disciples have made considerable progress. The power you have developed, the capacity you have developed can be used tomorrow for God-realisation. Now it is being used for God-manifestation. Once we establish more receptivity in meditation by practice, the physical also gets more strength. Then tomorrow we can do something else with the strength we have accumulated.</p>
<p>Some of you have been meditating four times a day. Out of a half hour session some of you have meditated well for, say, ten minutes, and out of a total of two hours during the day, you may have meditated extremely well for half an hour. Previously you meditated only half an hour for your God-realisation. Out of half an hour perhaps you have meditated well for only two minutes because you found that sleep did not leave you. Here you are meditating many times a day and each time you meditate well, you develop some capacity. This capacity you are using now for a special purpose. This capacity does not go away. At another time when you have another goal to achieve, you can use this capacity which you have acquired. Instead of meditating for God-manifestation, you can meditate not for any special purpose, but to become an absolutely perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>So, the power that you have acquired to sit and meditate can and must be utilised for different things. If you did not acquire that capacity, naturally you would not be able to use it. Some of you have really acquired capacity, developed some inner muscles. You are not meditating mechanically; there is some inner vision.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should use an alarm. Otherwise, you have to become a Yogi to get the special Grace to wake you up. But please, when you meditate, do not keep a watch in front of you at every second. Some students may have this tendency, because they know they have to get ready to go to school. But if you really want to meditate soulfully, just dive deep within. True, you are not entering into Nirvana, but when you meditate, you are pleasing the Supreme. He will make you conscious of the fact that it is time to go to school. If you are really meditating, He will do this. But if you are in the fairyland, dreaming, wasting your precious time, it will not be His responsibility.</p>
