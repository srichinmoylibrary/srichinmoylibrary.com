<p>The manager of the Ambassador Hotel in Bangkok wanted to talk to me. He had been smoking a cigarette, but as soon as he saw me, he took it out of his mouth and cupped it in his palm because he wanted to show me respect.</p>
<p>This is similar to what happened in India when a friend of mine saw me. But in my friend's case, he put his burning cigarette in his pocket!</p>

<p>I have blessed these two statues very nicely, and Nayana has put two garlands around them.</p>
<p>Already they have human souls. They are absolutely like living beings! They should have a human incarnation.</p>

<p>At six-thirty in the morning I was playing the cello in my hotel room in Hua Hin. All of a sudden I heard a pounding on my door: bang, bang, bang! A lady was screaming. I thought she was saying, "Police, police!" but she was actually saying, "Sleep, sleep!"</p>
<p>I looked through the viewing hole in the door and saw that she had only a white towel around her. So I didn't open the door. She was saying, "I need sleep, I need sleep!"</p>
<p>I said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry!"</p>
<p>I was playing the cello, not the saxophone, but she couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago when I was playing the cello in my hotel room, a man came to my door and said, "You play well, but my daughter is sick, so I am asking you to stop."</p>

<p>At the Holiday Inn in Kuching, Borneo, there was an Indian restaurant. When I went there, they did not want to let me in because I was uncivilised-wearing shorts.</p>
<p>I said, "I am an Indian. You won't allow me in?"</p>
<p>The girl said, "Let me go and speak to the boss."</p>
<p>The boss said, "All right, as long as you aren't wearing sandals." Fortunately, I was wearing my running shoes.</p>
<p>Then I showed the girl what I wanted on the menu. Half an hour later the food still had not come. When I asked the girl what was going on, she said, "You have not ordered." She had forgotten!</p>
<p>I got mad at her and the boss scolded her. Then she came to me for consolation. I said that I forget things every day and told her that I was not angry.</p>
<p>The poor girl had been working there for only two weeks. She was so happy that I had forgiven her.</p>

<p>Today I went to a gym near the Holiday Inn. The gym owner recognised me the moment I walked in; he had seen my picture in Muscle Mag.</p>
<p>At first he didn't believe that I was really Sri Chinmoy. Then Savyasachi gave him our brochure, and he said that he had recognised me the moment I had walked in.</p>
<p>Like a child, he was showing me all his different equipment. I told him, "I have come here with some students."</p>
<p>He said, "Please bring them here. For them, everything is free."</p>
<p>I told him that I would lift him. He was so thrilled. He said he would keep the picture of the lift in his office.</p>

<p>I gave the old man a shirt and the young Iban chief an ocarina. They were both very happy.</p>
<p>I also gave each of them six pictures that I had taken myself when they were dancing. Long live my camera!</p>
<p>Both the old man and the chief had tremendous receptivity.</p>

<p>When I met the Sultan in Kuala Lumpur, immediately I got a very good vibration from him. In a previous incarnation I had known his soul quite well. At that time the Sultan had a very, very close connection with me, but our relationship was totally different.</p>
<p>The Sultan also felt something in me. He was so kind and affectionate from beginning to end. He showed me the same kind of affection that Dan Lurie, the physical fitness proponent, shows me.</p>
<p>In the newspaper he had seen the picture of my lifting Samy Vellu. So when he saw me, he immediately said, "Do you want to lift me?" Of course I did! The whole time I was lifting him, he was in a trance; he was so happy.</p>

<p>Now the bus driver outwardly has developed such admiration for me. It is because Frank Zane's soul is acting inside his soul.</p>
