<p>Arrogance incarnate he was. His disproportionate sense of superiority and ego were too much for the Master to bear. He wanted the Master to be <em>his</em> Master, but he had to be the Master of his girlfriend. The Master did not approve of his close association with the girl. Therefore, he left and the girl also left.</p>

<p>An astrologer predicted that his mother would die in a few months’ time. The Master laughed and said no.</p>
<p>“How do you know, Master? My mother lives in Philadelphia. How do you know?”“I know.”</p>
<p>Finally the astrologer gave him the date. In a week’s time she would die. The Master told him, “Let us see whether she dies in a week or not.”</p>
<p>While the mother was walking in the kitchen, she fell down. The big toe on her left foot was hurt, but not severely. However, the old lady made a scene. She cursed the son’s Master. She said, “If he really cared for me, then how could it be possible for me to stumble in the kitchen and break my toe? Either he is very inconsiderate or it was God’s Grace that prevented me from having a more serious accident. In any case, he does not deserve to have my son as his disciple. ”</p>
<p>The son felt confused. Then he came to the conclusion that if the Master had real power, how was it that he could not avert this catastrophe? Protection should be complete and perfect. So he left.</p>
<p>A few months later he came back, full of remorse. The Master forgave him, and gave him special attention and finally told him, “You are ready. I want you to run a Centre in another state.” But he thought the Master was cleverly trying to get rid of him. He said to the Master, “Why do you have to get rid of me? Let me get rid of you.” Once again he left the Master.</p>

<p>He was a lawyer. He asked the Master to put a special force on him so that he would be successful in his law practice. Although he had a very high education, he was not doing well. But the Master told him that he could not make any promises. The Master wanted to leave the entire matter at the Feet of the Supreme. The lawyer said, “If you advise me to place everything at the Feet of the Supreme, then why do I need you to be the intermediary between God and myself? Let me take care of myself.”</p>
<p>By the way, before he came to the Centre he had a vision of the Master and the following day he saw the Master’s picture in the newspaper. It was exactly the same picture he had seen in his dream. He was so deeply moved. That is how he joined the Centre.</p>

<p>She had a car accident and her car was damaged. She expected her insurance company to fix the car or give her the money to pay for repairs. She came to the Master and said, “Either you do something with my car or cure my husband, who constantly accuses me of insanity. I know clearly that he has become senile, insane, but he thinks that it is I who have become insane. So either you cure him, or do something with regard to my accident. And I have another serious problem with my husband which I told you about previously.”</p>
<p>The Master gave her a broad smile and said, “All these matters I would like to place at the Feet of the Supreme.”</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “Since you have no true concern, no personal concern for me, why do I have to remain your disciple?”</p>
<p>She left.</p>

<p>He felt that the Master could be <em>his</em> Master, but he expected all his brother and sister disciples to recognise him as <em>their</em> Master, for he felt he had hundreds of experiences, whereas they had none. He used to say, “I assure you that the Master has given me abundant occult power. If I tell you that I have occult power, you won’t believe me. But you can ask the Master and if the Master is sincere, then he will definitely tell you that he has granted me tremendous occult power.” So the disciples wrote to the Master and asked him about this.</p>
<p>The Master said, “I can’t say whether he has occult power or not. But if he has, then that occult power is not from me. It is from some other person, some other world.”</p>
<p>On hearing this, the man got disturbed, mad, furious. He gave up his self-styled leadership and left the Centre.</p>

<p>Each time she had occasion to see the Master, her soul would come to the fore and she cried most devotedly and soulfully. Sometimes it was sincere; sometimes, unfortunately, it was not sincere. This went on, and one of her friends, who did not appreciate this kind of emotional scene, always used to criticise her. Finally, she saw that such outbursts were not doing any good. Outwardly she said she had to leave the country; therefore, she would not be able to follow the Master’s path. Inwardly she felt that it was impossible for her to get anything significant from the Master even though she cried so bitterly for the Master to recognise her as one of his most ardent disciples.</p>

<p>He thought that he was the world’s best business consultant, but unfortunately the Master’s disciples saw that he was not only physically fat but also mentally fat. It was difficult for them to have faith in him, so they did not take any advice from him. He thought that since he was not appreciated at the Centre, it was useless for him to stay. Also, he blamed the Master for not speaking highly of him as a business consultant.</p>

<p>On her wedding day she discovered that her husband was anything but divine. She wanted to punish her husband. She felt that the best punishment would be for her to go and stay with a Chinese gentleman who had three children. The Master did not approve of such severe punishment. So she said to the Master, “Since you don’t approve of this punishment, you don’t deserve me. I know that you will not be able to change my husband’s nature.”</p>
<p>The Master said to her, “Give me at least a chance.”</p>
<p>She said, “I know your capacity.”</p>
<p>Luckily, the Master was not responsible for this marriage.</p>

<p>When her husband ran away with her best friend, she felt miserable. She felt that it was all the Master’s fault. Why did the Master allow her husband to be so undivine? The Master sympathised with her and assured her that she would get a better husband if she stayed with the path.</p>
<p>She said to the Master, “If I stay on your path, I won’t be able to take any revenge. I want to marry a fool to prove to my husband that I don’t give any importance to scholarly life. Let him stay with his head-factory. I shall stay with my heart-garden.”</p>

<p>The husband and the wife were blessed with a child. They begged the Master to give him a name, and the Master gave them a broad smile. They thought that the smile indicated the Master’s consent and that in the near future the Master would give the child a spiritual name. Alas, they waited for a month, two, three, four, five months. Then they said to the Master, “How is it that you are not keeping your promise? You told us that you would give a spiritual name to our child.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “When did I say this? When and where?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t use words but your smile was more than enough to convince us that you did want to give him a name.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Your intuition did not do justice to my smile. I shall not be able to give him a name.”</p>
<p>Both of them left, mad and furious. But the divine force, the Compassion of the Supreme, did not leave them. Therefore, inwardly they used to pray to the Master and there came a time when they returned to him. Then the Master immediately gave the child a name. In this way the Master lost and regained three disciples.</p>

<p>He became jealous of the President of the Centre. He thought that since he had come to the Centre long before the President, it was he who deserved to be President. Also, he felt that he had more love for the Master and more faith in the Master than the President. He said to the President, “Do you really have all faith in the Master, or is it just a pretence?”</p>
<p>The President said, “I do have faith, all faith, in my Master.”</p>
<p>“If you have faith, then it is all fanatic faith. If the Master asks you to jump off the fifth floor, will you immediately jump?”</p>
<p>The President said, “Of course, of course. ”</p>
<p>When sincerity came forward, the man felt from within that he did not have that kind of faith in the Master. Then he said to himself, “Since I am not as good as this man, who is to blame? The Master. How is it that he didn’t give me this kind of faith? Since I lost that case, for me the best thing is to leave.”</p>

<p>She used to come to the Master and, at the same time, she used to go regularly to church. There she always had to make confession to the priest that she had spoken to this Indian teacher. Instead of showing compassion, the priest used to scold her and tell her that this was the worst possible sin.</p>
<p>She had lost her husband many years ago, and the Indian teacher used to bring messages to her from her deceased husband. Sometimes the messages were so accurate that she was astonished. Some of her relatives, who were also priests in another part of the world, wanted her to offer her house to the priests. She asked the Indian teacher whether her husband wished her to give it to the priests or to sell it. The Indian teacher said that the husband’s wish was for her to sell it. She said to the teacher, “If it is my husband’s wish to sell it, then you will have to be responsible. You have to tell when it will be sold.”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “In three months’ time it will be sold, provided you sell at a particular price.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh no, that price is too low. I can’t sell it.”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “This is the price that I got from your husband. Your husband told me to quote this price.”</p>
<p>She said, “Impossible! You are telling a lie.” Then the teacher said, “All right, I am telling a lie. In that case, you should give away the house to the priests.”</p>
<p>She said, “Oh no, that I can’t do. I need money. ”</p>
<p>“You need money. Who does not need money? But your husband wants you to have the amount that I told you.”</p>
<p>Finally she agreed. Then the teacher said, “If you personally go to your house in two weeks’ time, then you will be able to sell it in three months’ time.”</p>
<p>She said, “If I will sell the place in three months’ time, why do I have to go in two weeks’ time?”</p>
<p>The teacher said, “It will be necessary.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t listen to the teacher. She began showing her house to customers only three weeks before the end of the three-month period. She did not sell the house. Then she insulted the teacher because her house was not sold. Finally she left him.</p>

<p>“My brother has become close, quite close, to the Master, but I definitely know that if I follow my brother’s path, I can easily surpass him. In him I always notice a kind of over-enthusiastic fanaticism. He is carried away by all the outer world’s fantasy and by the inner world’s most complicated and unexplainable fantasy.” This is what he thought.</p>
<p>But after following his brother’s path for a few months, he felt differently. “Alas, I have tried in vain to outshine my brother with my dedicated service, but my brother wants to please the Master in his own way. He feels that is the only way to become happy, whereas I feel that if my happiness has to depend on somebody else’s compassion, pity or even love, then I don’t need that person. I want to remain my own boss, self-sufficient.” Also, he felt that the disciples were all fond of his brother and his brother’s craziness, but they were not fond of his own inner maturity.</p>

<p>“My nose cancer could have been cured if the person who I thought was the modern Christ had actually been a real Master. It was my mistake to consider anybody as Master except the Christ. He who does not have the miracle-power can never be a true spiritual Master. So let me go and only cry for the Christ, who was all miracle-power plus the eternal life-saving miracle.” This is what she felt, so she left the path.</p>

<p>“The life of the soul is not so charming and pleasing. Only the life of the lower vital is charming and pleasing. While pleasing the lower vital in oneself and in others, if one gets material wealth, then it is best to get four houses plus vital satisfaction. The life of the soul can wait because, after all, the soul’s life is dealing with Eternity.” This is what the person felt.</p>
