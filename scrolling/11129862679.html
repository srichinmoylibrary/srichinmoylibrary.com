<p><em>Mayor Beame [Shaking Sri Chinmoy's hand as Sri Chinmoy greets him outside the Gallery]:</em> How are you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am extremely grateful to you. It is so kind of you to come. I wish to offer you my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [After welcoming the Mayor into the Gallery]</em>: May I play for a couple of minutes on an Indian instrument, the esraj?</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> Yes. <em>Sri Chinmoy plays several of his own compositions on the esraj.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [Presenting a plaque to the Mayor and reading out the inscription]:</em> To Mayor Beame, the unparalleled champion pilot of New York. Mayor Beame, the soul of New York will eternally treasure your matchless contributions to change the face and fate of each and every New Yorker. With deepest appreciation and admiration, the United Nations Meditation Group and Fountain-Art.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> Thank you. May I say something? I'm very deeply moved by this presentation and I want to say that I could have used a lot of these moments of meditation during these last months and years. And I certainly didn't think, the first day I met you, that I'd ever have the pleasure of meeting you again tonight. I want to thank you very much for your kindness and your warmth and your expressions. I appreciate it and I want to thank everybody here as well. <em>[Applause]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now we have something else to offer you. Just two hours ago I composed a song in your honour and my students now are going to sing this song. I wish to offer this soulful song to your soul.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>The singers sing "O Great Pilot, Mayor Beame."</em></p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> What are you doing next week? <em>[Laughter]</em> Thank you very much. I really enjoyed it; I appreciate it. I wish Mrs. Beame were here so she could hear it.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now, with your kind permission, I wish to paint something. It will take only a few minutes. Right here, in front of you, I would like to paint one painting, and then I wish to offer it to you.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> All right, fine.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This will be our third soulful offering to you.</p>
<p><em>In a matter of minutes, Sri Chinmoy paints a 16 x 20" original with acrylics.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [Presenting the painting]:</em> This is my humble offering.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame:</em> Thank you. Thank you very much. If I knew I was going to get so much, I would have brought a valise or something. This is more than I've received in a long, long time, and I not only appreciate it for its material good, but more particularly for your sentiments. I very much appreciate it. Thank you. <em>[Applause]</em> I wanted to thank the singers. Could I do that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, please.</p>
<p><em>Mayor Beame [Shaking hands with all the singers]:</em> I just want to thank you. It was wonderful. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>[To everyone]</em> Thank you, you've made my evening wonderful.</p>
<p><em>Woman from the audience: You made New York great! [Applause]</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The U.N. Meditation Group With Muhammad Ali</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The U.N. Meditation Group With Muhammad Ali" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On the morning of his championship fight with Earnie Shavers on 29 September, Muhammad Ali met with Sri Chinmoy and members of the United Nations Meditation Group for an hour of prayer, meditation and discussion.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy garlanded the champion and presented him with a trophy, saying, "Along with this is my heart. My heart is inside this."</p>
<p>Later, some thirty U.N. Meditation Group singers sang a song which Sri Chinmoy had composed in the fighter's honour, and the group meditated together in silence for about twenty minutes. Afterwards, Ali told Sri Chinmoy, "I was so deeply absorbed, I couldn't do anything." As the group was leaving, he added, "This really got my spirits high. It might end in one round now. God bless you." Following is a short excerpt from the conversation, as well as a commentary about the meeting which Sri Chinmoy gave at the United Nations the next day.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yesterday it was our strong desire to honour you at the United Nations. Unfortunately, you could not be at the United Nations.</p>
<p><em>Muhammad Ali:</em> I was so obligated; I couldn't make it. I appreciated it. I was real honoured to get that invitation, but we couldn't make it. What do you do there?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We pray and meditate twice a week. On Tuesdays and Fridays we pray together with the delegates and staff. There I was going to offer you my deepest gratitude for what you are doing-not only for the black Muslims but also for mankind. You are changing the face and fate of mankind. Your very name encourages and inspires. As soon as people hear 'Muhammad Ali,' they are inspired. They get tremendous joy. They get such dynamism to be brave and face ignorance. Your very name does that. That's why I am so grateful to you, so proud of you.</p>
<p><em>Muhammad Ali:</em> My goal is to be like you one day-to be peaceful and out of this sport working for humanity and for God. I was telling Jeremiah that after we finish boxing I want to learn how to get out of this life and use my popularity and my intelligence for humanity-to help people in whatever way I can. I don't know how, but I want to do something-bring people together, work for God and help people. I know there is something I am supposed to do, but I don't know really exactly what its purpose is but it's something.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know the purpose. It is only a question of Allah's Hour. You are the supreme instrument of Allah. Today He is utilising you as the greatest boxer. One day He will utilise you as the greatest preacher. The other day I was reading in the newspaper about you as a preacher and minister. So, now your heart of love you are using for a special purpose.</p>
<p><em>Muhammad Ali:</em> I'll only say one thing, Brother, not to cut you off. But I don't want and I never wanted the image of being the greatest preacher. Boxing is all publicity. In this country this is how we promote: "I'm the greatest. I'll get him in round seven." But this is not really my heart. This is just outer appearance to promote fights. I don't really feel this way. Ministry is so serious, and there everybody is equal before God. Therefore, I don't want to get the image of being the greatest preacher, because that's boastful; it is not humble, it is not spiritual. So I don't want to go into the thing that I am the greatest preacher: just a minister, just a lecturer or helper.</p>
<p>There are so many people who are great but only God, Allah, is really great. Therefore, I want to get out of this brashness, this image. We've got to stop that "I'm the greatest" thing and forget it. I am just a humble servant and I have a lot to learn. I need people like yourself to teach me what to say and what to do and how to approach certain things. So I don't want to talk that "I am the greatest" attitude and preach it. Do you understand what I mean? I don't want that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't have to say that you are the greatest, but your heart of oneness with all humanity makes you the greatest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">17.</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="17." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say a few words about the world-champion, Muhammad Ali. Yesterday was a most significant day both for the members of the United Nations Meditation Group and for the champion, Muhammad Ali. <em>[Pointing to the two photographs]</em> This is Muhammad Ali in his physical consciousness and this is Muhammad Ali in his soulful consciousness. Each individual has two aspects: the physical aspect and the spiritual aspect. This moment he expresses himself or reveals his capacities through physical means; the next moment he expresses his reality's divinity through spiritual means. In this picture we see Muhammad Ali in a devoted, soulful, cheerful and powerful consciousness. Right beside it is another picture which brings forward his other aspect: physical strength. We believe in evolution. From the stone life we go to the plant life, then to the animal life, then to the human life and finally to the divine life, where we are striving for perfection. From the physical and vital consciousness, slowly and steadily we have to evolve to the psychic consciousness, the supreme consciousness.</p>
<p>The very name 'Muhammad Ali' inspires millions of people on the vital plane. We cannot say that the vital plane is not good, that only the spiritual plane is good. No, all the planes are good; only some planes have to be elevated to a higher consciousness. Some planes need more purity, more determination, more awareness and more acceptance of light. The physical, the vital, the mind and the heart are all members of the same family. They must be amalgamated; they must be illumined and perfected.</p>
<p>What can achieve this perfection? It is our inner cry, our aspiration. And what carries the greatest responsibility for elevating the consciousness of human beings all over the world? What place carries the utmost responsibility for elevating, illumining, perfecting and fulfilling the length and breadth of the world? The answer is the United Nations. The United Nations carries the heaviest burden of human problems and the United Nations is responsible for bringing light into these problems.</p>
<p>Right now the physical is wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance-sleep; therefore, the physical needs to be awakened. The vital is aggressive quite often; therefore, the vital needs dynamism. The mind is full of doubt and uncertainty; therefore, the mind needs faith and certainty. The heart is full of insecurity; therefore, the heart needs confidence. When the wakefulness of the body, the dynamism of the vital, the faith and certainty of the mind and the confidence of the heart come forward and become one, then only does the individual become perfect.</p>
<p>Each individual as well as each nation has these good qualities. Since it is the individuals who form the country, it is always advisable for the individuals to bring these qualities forward first; then, whatever the country has will also come forward. When the individual brings forward his good qualities, it becomes easier for the country to bring forward its qualities.</p>
<p>Who is giving us the capacities, the inexhaustible capacities, that are needed to bring these qualities forward and illumine our imperfections? It is the soul of the United Nations. The deeper reality in the United Nations is blessing us at every moment. If we think that we are glorifying the United Nations by working here, then we are making a mistake. It is the United Nations, the soul of the United Nations, that has blessed us by giving us the golden opportunity to be of service to it.</p>
<p>Right now, in the political world, the mental aspect is predominant. In political ways the countries are trying to establish oneness, peace, harmony and so forth. But in our Meditation Group we are trying to bring to the fore the psychic qualities, the inner qualities, which are peace, light, love, harmony and the feeling of oneness. The Meditation Group is aspiring soulfully and devotedly and, according to our inner capacity, each individual member here is receiving light directly from the soul of the United Nations. The soul of the United Nations has given us ample opportunity, out of its boundless bounty, to share with the rest of the world the peace that we get from it.</p>
<p>All religious faiths, all countries, are one on the inner plane. Outwardly they are still not seeing eye to eye with one another, but in the inner world, definitely they have got the message of the United Nations. Therefore, they have all come together here. They see that they are from one Source, and that only in the One will they get their ultimate satisfaction. When Muhammad Ali accepted our invitation to be with him, it proved in abundant measure that the physical and the vital in him wanted illumination. The interview lasted for about an hour and for about twenty minutes we meditated together soulfully and devotedly in pin-drop silence. If he had not been spiritual, he would not have granted the interview; nor would he have meditated with us and accepted the fruits of our prayer and meditation. But he did meditate with us and receive what we offered to him, so we know definitely that he is spiritual in the purest sense of the term. He prayed with us and meditated with us and he shared with us wholeheartedly his inner divinity.</p>
<p>Many times I have been misunderstood when I see famous people. Some people think that I am going out of my spiritual domain, that I am entering into another world for name and fame. But those who have faith in me do not misunderstand me. Here I wish to say that each individual, no matter in which field he shines, has received some light from above. Since I am a seeker of the Absolute, the Supreme, out of his infinite Bounty has also given me some light. This light I want to share with others who have received light from above and who are sharing it with the rest of the world in different fields and in different ways. We are all God's children. One son of His has achieved something. The other one comes to soulfully congratulate him and, while congratulating him, he brings with him his appreciation, admiration, good will, love and oneness. This is the exchange of our light.</p>
<p>To be with Muhammad Ali is not just a coincidence; nor is it a display of our vital emotion or exuberance in order to get name and fame. No, here the soul of the United Nations has given us a golden opportunity to spread its light and its message of universal oneness. We are all seekers; we are all in the same boat. Therefore, I can safely say that this morning, while I was running from my house to the playground where we practise sports, I vividly saw-not with my third eye but with my human eyes-the soul of the United Nations. It was extremely happy and delighted at what we have achieved. As a matter of fact, it is the meaningful and fruitful blessing of the soul of the United Nations that has manifested in a tangible form in the divinely inspired meeting between Muhammad Ali and our Meditation Group.</p>
<p>Millions of people will see what we are doing. The heart of each individual who sees this picture in <em>The New York Times</em> will definitely feel that the United Nations is the only answer for humanity's oneness and divinity's satisfaction in human life, which is aspiring to be totally transformed and illumined. So this meeting with Muhammad Ali is a supreme achievement for the United Nations which each member of the United Nations can embody and treasure and this achievement is nothing short of a supreme gift from the soul of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lillian Carter met with Sri Chinmoy and the members of the Meditation Group in Americus, Georgia, on 7 October, charming them with tales of her experiences in India and vignettes about what it is like to be the President's mother.</p>
<p>The group, in turn, meditated with Miss Lillian and sang a song composed by Sri Chinmoy in her honour, which brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>A brief part of their conversation follows. Here Miss Lillian was talking about the U.N. Meditation Group's public concert that evening.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Well, this is going to be a lovely night. I hope you have a crowd. People don't understand this. I don't know whether many people will be here or not. Have you heard?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Steven Hein:</em> We really don't know if a lot of people will come or not. There was a little article in the newspaper.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Yes, and weren't you in Plains this afternoon?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Steven Hein:</em> Yes. There are a few posters up there.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> But here they don't understand I am the only one who does, and I wouldn't miss it but I hope you're going to have a nice crowd.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With your kind permission, may I meditate for a minute?</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Oh yes. <em>[To the group]</em> He wants me to be quiet!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not in the least! Far from it Please forgive me. My students had informed me that you would like me to meditate for a minute that's why.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Y'all better be quiet now, we're going to meditate. <em>[Silent meditation for four or five minutes.]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Thank you. Very nice.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now I wish to offer a soulful song to you, which I composed yesterday. It is about you. First I would like to sing it and then my students will sing it for you. Could my students come in now, please?</p>
<p><em>[They open the door and additional members o the United Nations Meditation Group come in.]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just yesterday I composed it in honour of you.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Wonderful! Y'all come in! [Turning to the Secret Service agent accompanying her] Ray, you should see the little piano, little organ, or what-do-you-call-it! <em>[To the members of the Meditation Group]</em> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These are the members of the United Nations Meditation Group.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Beautiful, beautiful. The saris are gorgeous. I never could wear one because I couldn't put it on. Hello! Hello! How many are there?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here there are about forty.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Wonderful.</p>
<p><em>[Sri Chinmoy sings the song Compassion-Ocean, Mother Lillian, accompanying himself on the tote-a-tune.]</em></p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> That's beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now they will sing.</p>
<p><em>[The members of the United Nations Meditation Group sing Compassion-Ocean, Mother Lillian.]</em></p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> You just don't know me. I'm not that good! Oh boy, this is wonderful! But I just really don't deserve all this.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You deserve all this and much, much more.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Oh, no, no, no, I don't. This is just beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And we mean it. What we have sung, we literally mean it.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Thank you, thank you, Sir.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:..</em>.It is all of our hearts' feelings.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Thank you very much. It is a great honour that you are doing this for me. But you don't know me. Ray knows me, though. He knows that I'm not that good. Don't you, Ray? It's beautiful. Let me ask you something. Do you go everywhere with...I call him Mr. Chinmoy...all together all the time?</p>
<p><em>U.N. Meditation Group member:</em> As often as we can.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have many more students. We have about eight hundred or so.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> I envy you your calmness. It took my best to sit still, much less meditate. I'm not much of a meditator. I did go to the meeting every Thursday night and I did meditate with them.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But you have meditated with me extremely well.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Do you want me to tell you the truth? I don't know what I was thinking about, but I had a thousand thoughts. I can't get everything out of my head like you can. When you meditate, you completely bare your mind, don't you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time, we do not have a mind at all. When we meditate, we only live in the heart and we become the heart itself.</p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> I have heard that and I think it is beautiful. But the only way I can meditate is to go somewhere by myself. I go to what I call my Pond House, I can go out and sit and look out over the pond, and then I can meditate.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We belong to the United Nations Meditation Group. This is for you, Mother, this is our offering. <em>[Sri Chinmoy presents Miss Lillian with the United Nations Meditation Group banner.</em></p>
<p><em>Miss Lillian:</em> Oh, this is beautiful. Thank you. Oh it is beautiful.</p>
<p><em>At the concert that the U.N. Meditation Group presented later that evening, Sri Chinmoy played the Indian esraj and members of the Group sang several Bengali and American songs, including India's National Anthem and "America the Beautiful."</em></p>
<p><em>During the concert Sri Chinmoy commented:</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a seeker. I have been here for six or seven hours. On the strength of my aspiration, I wish to say what I feel about Plains. Simplicity, sincerity, spontaneity, humility and self-giving are the birthright of this town. This is what my inner aspiration tells me and I wish to offer my soulful gratitude to the soul of this town where our dear President was born.</p>

<h2>Swami Vivekananda</h2>

<p>Yesterday was the birthday of Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda was a supreme seeker and supreme lover of mankind. He was also the preserver of the universal vision. I am invoking his presence.</p>
<p>Was Swami Vivekananda a man? Yes, he was. Something else he also was: a lover-hero.</p>
<p>Did Swami Vivekananda really conquer America? Yes, he did. Truth to tell, it was a mutual conquest. Vivekananda conquered America's seeker-heart. America conquered Vivekananda's vision-eye.</p>
<p>What did Swami Vivekananda preach in the West? The Vedantic philosophy. Something he also did. In supreme secrecy, soulfully and lovingly on the vital plane, persistently and unconditionally on the mental plane and compassionately and unreservedly on the physical plane, he distributed Sri Ramakrishna's universal oneness-heart and blessingful joy. Sri Ramakrishna loved at once Vivekananda's silence-heart and his sound-life. To his Naren what he gave was his own realisation-ocean. In his Naren what he found was his own vision-manifestation. Where? Here, there and all-where.</p>
<p>To the weak, Vivekananda had only one thing to say: "Fear not."</p>
<p>To the strong, he had only one thing to say: "Stop not."</p>
<p>To God, he had only one thing to say: "Delay not."</p>
<p>And to himself, he had only one thing to say: "Ask not."</p>

<p>Yesterday was President Roosevelt's birthday. We wish to observe it today.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, we, the members of the United Nations, salute you! O man of lofty ideals, O hero-warrior, O prophet of the world-illumining dawn, we soulfully salute you!</p>
<p>Admiration you received in abundant measure; condemnation too. One more thing your soul rightfully deserved-your dear countrymen should have seen life clearer and should have seen it as a whole, as you so surprisingly did.</p>
<p>The supremacy of your soul's will power over your body's revolt, your physical paralysis, was unparalleled. Your very existence was a stranger to fear. Your indomitable courage was far beyond the flight of our wildest imagination. It was your heart's wisdom-light that so lovingly and convincingly taught the entire world: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Indeed, the vision-light of this loftiest message can illumine the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>The embodiment of your vision-height and action-power will always be treasured by the freedom-loving and peace-spreading world. It was your own aspiration-mind and dedication-heart that planned for this organisational conference of the United Nations. Therefore, today's flowering United Nations to you bows with its gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>Peace and faith: these two divine qualities abide in each other. Your last message to the American nation can most unmistakably and most profitably be accepted and treasured by the vast world: "To all Americans who dedicate themselves to the making of an abiding peace, I say the only limit to our realisation of tomorrow will be our doubt of today. Let us move forward with strength and active faith."</p>
<p>O great good illumining, inspiring fulfilling soul, Franklin Roosevelt, to you we bow.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Do we have the capacity to help others?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Do we have the capacity to help others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Do we have the capacity to help others? Yes, we do. Do we have the capacity to help others in words? Yes, we do. Do we have the capacity to help others in deeds? Yes, we do. Then how is it that we do not help others? We do not help others for various reasons. I wish to cite a few deplorable and painful reasons.The most deplorable reason is a very simple one. We do not want to see happiness in others; we want only our own happiness. By nature, we human beings are cruel to one another. By nature, we do not want to see others happy. When we see that others are happy, we feel that our own little world is totally shattered and destroyed. The animal in us gets happiness from destruction. The human in us gets happiness from division and a sense of separativity. But the divine in us gets satisfaction only from oneness. The divine in us knows nothing else save and except oneness.</p>
<p>So the main reason that we do not help others is because we do not want to see others happy. This is the root cause. This root cause branches into several subsidiary causes. One of the subsidiary causes is that we want the rest of the world to see how important we are. When others come to us for help, we feel that we are indispensable. But when we come to learn that the same people have gone to others for help, we feel that we were right in not helping them. We feel that since the other party did not feel that we were indispensable, since the party went to others, we did the right thing in not helping. In this way we justify our unwillingness to help.</p>
<p>There is human friendship and divine friend; ship. Human friendship says, "Give me; I need." Divine friendship says, "Take me, for I am all yours." When we exercise our human friendship, we tell the world, "Give us; we need." When we exercise our divine friendship, we tell the world, "Take us, for we are all yours." The human in us has not only failed us time and again, but it will always fail us. The divine in us has always succeeded and will always succeed. This divine success is nothing short of world harmony and universal harmony, world peace and universal peace, world satisfaction and universal satisfaction.</p>
<p>Divine friendship is founded upon oneness. The source of divine friendship, divine love and divine concern is oneness. For this reason, divine friendship is lasting. On the other hand, human friendship on earth is nothing but a rope of sand. We shall not be an inch from truth if we say that most human beings are fair-weather friends. When we are desperate and facing inclement weather, our so-called friends desert us in a twinkling. We come out in the street and see an individual and ask him, "Are you my friend?" He says, "Of course, I am your friend, but on one condition: that you never ask me for a favour." Then we see another individual and ask him, "Are you my friend?" He says, "Of course I am, but on one condition: that I shall be at least one inch superior to you. You have to be under me. If you are ready to be at my beck and call, if you are ready to be at my feet, then I will accept you as my friend."</p>
<p>We see a third individual and say, "Are you my friend?" He answers, "Of course I an; but on one condition: whenever I am in need, you have to come to my rescue. But if ever you are in need, you must not count on me, for I have many, many things to do on earth other than helping you. So, if you want to be my friend, then let your acceptance of me be unconditional."</p>
<p>So, when we are looking for a friend, we are like a helpless beggar. At that time, God our supreme Source is playing the role of the eternal beggar in and through us. He wants to play the role of a veritable beggar and we are extremely grateful to Him that He has chosen us for this; in and through us He will fulfil His begging task. Then God goes to some other individuals and asks them to assist others. He wants to play another role in and through them: the role of the eternal giver the divine friend. But to His wide surprise He gets no response. But since God is compassionate to the needy, He continues trying to find some individuals who will allow Him to play this role in and through them. He is looking for some individuals in and through whom He can fulfil the aspiration-life and the desire-life of those in whom He is playing the role of a beggar. Finally, He finds some souls that are receptive. They are more than willing to abide by His express request, and they come to the rescue of those who are desperately in need of help.</p>
<p>When the seeker needs help, he can only do one thing. He has to dive deep within and bring to the fore his adamantine will. This adamantine will he will place at the Feet of the Absolute Supreme. Then the Absolute Supreme grants His all-fulfilling Compassion-light to the adamantine will of the seeker. When the seeker's will and the Supreme Grace become one and are ready to work together, man's aspiration-world and God's Satisfaction-World make God the Beggar and God the Giver totally fulfilled both in the aspiration-world of earth and the satisfaction-world of Heaven.</p>

<p>Dear brothers and sisters, while walking along Eternity's Road, I shall love and serve you. Just because you have given me the opportunity to love and serve you, I shall constantly and eternally offer you my life of concern here on earth and my soul of oneness in Heaven.</p>
<p>We are all of the One, our Beloved Supreme. We came into the world to fulfil one soulful promise which we made to Him before we entered into this world arena. This promise was to please Him in His own way through our aspiration-heart and dedication-life. We shall without fail fulfil our solemn promise, for we know that our Inner Pilot, our fate-maker, will never allow us to remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>As we said, Him to please in His own way we came into the world. Even so, our Beloved Supreme is always ready to please the real in us, the soul, which is inseparably one with Him. The soul is a blue bird which flies in the firmament of Consciousness, Light and Bliss, eternally singing only one song-the song of our Beloved Supreme's constant Victory here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A meeting with Indian Prime Minister Desai</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A meeting with Indian Prime Minister Desai" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
SM 24. During his visit to the United Nations for the special session on disarmament, Indian Prime Minister Desai received members of the Meditation Group in a private meeting on 12 June 1978. The Group sang a Bengali song composed by Sri Chinmoy in honour of the Prime Minister, and Sri Chinmoy presented him with a plaque of appreciation with an inscription of the song. Sri Chinmoy and Prime Minister Desai spoke about the Bhagavad-Gita and the need for spiritual discipline in man's efforts toward world peace.</p>
<h2>A meeting with Indian Prime Minister Desai</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear Prime Minister, with you India is great and good; in you India is safe and happy</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai:</em> India can't be saved by one man. India can be saved only if people do their thing properly.</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai::</em> All of you work at the United Nations? So I hope you will unite the United Nations. The United Nations is called "United Nations," but they are not yet united. So you have to unite them.</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai:</em> I have written a commentary on the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> because I could not find the meaning of some verses satisfactorily in all the commentaries that I read. Therefore, only when I committed the <em>Gita</em> to memory, when I was in jail in 1934, and I began to recite it every day and to apply it to myself, then the meaning became very clear, because I had complete confidence and faith in the <em>Gita,</em> that what it says is right. If I don't understand it, it is my fault. And that is why I wrote the commentary, because when a friend asked me questions about two or three verses, I couldn't give him a satisfactory reply. I thought I would put down on paper what I understand. That is my sole writing. The Gita gives a solution to every problem. At any rate, when there is a conflict of duty, it gives the right answer.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right at the very beginning Arjuna had that problem.</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai:</em> It is a problem everywhere. In everyone there is a problem of good and evil. It goes on all the time. So one must accept the Gita's guidance. The gist of it is that you must be at peace with yourself. There should be no tension, no excitement, no anger.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And for that you have all along taught us to lead a disciplined life.</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai:</em> To have discipline is not enough. It must be self-discipline.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is what you have been teaching us for so many years. A life of discipline is of paramount importance.</p>
<p><em>Prime Minister Desai:</em> Without that you can get nothing.</p>

<h2>Expressions of gratitude</h2>

<p>Today you are celebrating my birthday. I wish to offer my gratitude to each of you, and to say that every day I observe my birthday in the hearts of my dear and near ones, in the hearts of those who are seated in the Boat of the Supreme, the Boat that is destined to carry us to the Shores of the Golden Beyond. I observe my birthday every day in your hearts with my deepest gratitude, and at the same time I observe your birthdays every day in the inmost recesses of my heart with deepest love and pride divine.</p>
<p>I came into the world to be of service to the Supreme in mankind. By forming this United Nations Meditation Group you have given me the golden opportunity to be of service to the United Nations and to the world at large, and for that I am immensely grateful to each member of this group. On Tuesdays in this Chapel and on Fridays in the conference room when we hold meditations, what do we actually do? We try to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above. In the outer world we are not in a position to show what we bring down from above, but in the inner world I wish to assure each of you that we do bring down these and other divine qualities. The Supreme out of His infinite Bounty showers His Blessings on us and on the United Nations as a whole. We are the chosen devoted instruments of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Again I wish to offer my deepest gratitude to all the members of the United Nations Meditation Group and to all the seekers who come and regularly, faithfully, devotedly, soulfully meditate for Peace. History will bear witness to the fact that we have tried and we are trying and we shall continue to try with utmost sincerity to bring Peace into our lives and into the life of the United Nations. In the name of the Supreme I wish to assure you that we shall succeed. Our Pilot Supreme is the Absolute Supreme Himself. He will manifest and fulfil Himself in and through all aspiring hearts at His own choice Hour.</p>

<p>Today we are celebrating the fifth anniversary of our Meditation Group at the United Nations. The number "five" has a most special significance. We have five senses. Each sense is of paramount importance. I pray to the Lord Supreme to grant us, out of His infinite Bounty, the capacity and receptivity to perfect our five senses so that we can be of better dedicated, devoted and unconditional service to the illumining soul and serving body of the United Nations. From today on, with our eyes we shall see only the divine Truth in God's creation; with our ears, we shall hear only the divine Truth; with our tongue we shall speak only the Truth. From today on, we shall breathe in inner truth; from today on our physical bodies shall be the torchbearers of the Supreme's infinite Truth. This is the prayer that I wish to offer to our Inner Pilot, the Absolute Supreme, on this auspicious occasion, the fifth anniversary of our Meditation Group at the United Nations.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish to offer my deepest gratitude to Sumedha, the secretary of our Meditation Group, for her constant dedicated service. Also, I offer my sincere gratitude to all the members of the Meditation Group who have been coming here faithfully and devotedly and serving this great body, the United Nations. The delegates and members of the Secretariat are trying to bring about peace. We are also trying to bring about peace in our own way through our prayer and meditation which is equally powerful, soulful and meaningful. The goal is the same, the destination is the same, only we are travelling along two different roads. Once we reach our destination we shall see that whatever is done with real sincerity is true, real and effective. Since the delegates and the members of the staff of the United Nations are also doing the right thing, absolutely the right thing, I wish to offer, on behalf of our Meditation Group, most sincere gratitude to them.</p>

<p>Sweet members of the United Nations Meditation Group, dear seekers, I wish to tell you with my heart's utmost sincerity that I was nothing, I am nothing and I shall be nothing. But there is Someone who was everything, who is everything, and who forever shall be everything, and I know Him. Him I have seen and Him I invoke to bless us out of His unconditional Compassion. He is our Eternity's All, our Beloved Supreme. I pray to Him to bless our devoted heads and our surrendered hearts so that we can be His perfect instruments on earth. Once we become His perfect instruments we shall be able to claim Him as our Eternity's own, very own. Beginning today, let us convince our body, vital, mind and heart that we are not only of Him from time immemorial-from before the very birth of creation-but also that we are for Him, that our purpose is to fulfil Him by accepting Him, claiming Him as our very own and playing our respective roles in His cosmic Game. What we all want is a world with a new heart and a new face. To achieve this what we need is constant self-giving to the Inner Pilot, who in silence is guiding every nation slowly, silently, unerringly. His success will be our progress in our life of aspiration, and our progress will be His success in His total and complete manifestation on earth.</p>
<p>From today on, let us claim the Tree, the Supreme, as our own, as He constantly claims us, the leaves, as His very own. If we claim Him as our very own, then our service will be more soulful more meaningful and more fruitful.</p>

<p>My life is a life of gratitude which I wish to offer to the seekers here and all over the world. This year and all the years that I will be on earth I will have only one purpose, and that is to offer my dedication, my dedicated service. Today there are about fifty seekers in this room. But I wish to tell all of you that when we pray and meditate here, the soul of the United Nations observes us with deepest joy, gratitude and pride. What we do here is recorded in the soul of the United Nations, imprinted in letters of gold. And the appreciation that you have offered now on behalf of the Meditation Group, I wish to place at the Feet of our Beloved Supreme, the Inner Pilot, for it is He who is acting in and through me; it is He who is acting in and through all of us.</p>
<p>What we call dedicated service is nothing but His Compassion-fulfilment in and through us. What we do has already been done by Him. He just allows us to act on the physical plane to convince us that we are participating in His divine Game. Otherwise, there is nothing on earth that we do which has not been done by our beloved Pilot Supreme. Out of His infinite Compassion He makes us feel that we have done it, for when we feel that we have done it we get greater glory and we feel that life is more fruitful. But to be absolutely honest with you, what we do here soulfully is actually being done by our Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>Our service to the United Nations will one day be felt by each and every individual who serves the United Nations. Right now their physical minds may not know what we are doing with our prayer and meditation. But every day their souls do feel what we are doing and their hearts at times also feel it. A day will come when all parts of their being will realise that what we are doing is not for ourselves but for the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of the United Nations. We do not need appreciation now, we do not need recognition. What we need is our own constant feeling of oneness with the body, vital, mind, heart and soul of the United Nations. Our feeling of oneness is what we want from our lives. To all of you, only one thing I can offer and that is my ever-growing and ever-glowing gratitude-flower in the heart of the Universal Reality which you are, which we all are.</p>

<p>On 30 April 1976, the United Nations Meditation Group welcomed members of the United Nations community to a special showing of Sri Chinmoy's art at the Jharna-Kala Gallery in New York's Soho art district. Following is Sri Chinmoy's reply to a special presentation by members of the Group.</p>
<p>This evening you are honouring the seeker in me. I am not a teacher; I am just a seeker and I shall always remain a seeker. Now here in the United Nations Meditation Group we are all seekers; we meditate on God, we pray to God to grant us out of His infinite Bounty peace in the outer world and peace in the inner world. I wanted to give a talk in response to the most inspiring offering that you have rendered to the Supreme in me. The singers have sung with their souls' aspiration and delight; the singers have conveyed my feelings about the United Nations infinitely better than I could have ever imagined. Therefore, I wish to offer to each seeker here something else which I consider to be the best in me, and that thing is my prayerful meditation. Just before I offer my prayerful meditation, I wish to say just a few words.</p>
<p>Greatness, goodness and oneness. Here at the United Nations, what the seeker in me observes right now is the message of greatness. Inside greatness there shall come a time when we shall hear the song of goodness, and there shall come a time without fail when inside goodness we shall see the dance of oneness. Greatness, goodness, oneness. We have started our journey with our inner cry, which we call aspiration, to become great. This is the first rung of our evolving ladder, which will ultimately reach the highest heights. The second rung is goodness. The third and ultimate rung is oneness. God, the Author of all good, will shower His devoted Blessings upon our surrendered heads and hearts, and at His Choice Hour He will teach us the significance of goodness. He has already taught us the message of greatness; now, at His Choice Hour, He will teach us the significance of goodness. Then finally He will teach us the dance of oneness. At that time, each aspiring soul in God's creation will fulfil God the absolute Truth, the transcendental Light, the universal Peace in His own way. On behalf of the United Nations Meditation Group, to each seeker present here I wish to offer my prayerful meditation, which is the only thing that I have and that I am in God's ever-fulfilling and ever-illumining Vision.</p>
