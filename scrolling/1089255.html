<p>Books on dreams can never, never be accurate. When the person sees the dream, it is one thing; when he tells it to others, it becomes totally different. This is the main reason why occultists and others find it difficult to give the proper significance of dreams. A person dreams one thing, but in telling others he sees that it becomes totally different or very vague. Then the occultist must concentrate very powerfully to tell on which plane the dream occurred.</p>
<p>There are many dream worlds. As there are seven higher and lower worlds, there are also many dream worlds. If someone sees a dream in a particular world, then its significance there will be one thing, and if he sees it in a higher dream world, that will be a totally different matter.</p>
<p>I have read quite a few books on dreams. I laugh and laugh because some of them are so absurd. But now that I have written a book on dreams, I must also laugh at myself because all I can do is give a general idea about the subject.</p>

 <p>
JSD 2-45. The questions in this book were asked of Sri Chinmoy at different times in the early 1970s. The names of the questioners were not recorded.</p>
<h2>Question: What are dreams?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dreams are realities of other worlds. If they are dreams from the lower worlds, the soul will either try to illumine and elevate them or try to destroy them. Unillumined dreams create tremendous problems for the seeker. If they are undivine dreams, the soul's light fights with them and does not want them to manifest.</p>
<p>If they are elevating dreams, dreams from the higher worlds, then the soul's light expedites their earthward journey. When the realities of the higher worlds want to come down, the soul's light helps them. As a matter of fact, it pulls them like a magnet and tries to manifest them. If they are not manifested, it means that the time has not yet come. Or perhaps the Divine within us may not feel it is necessary for them to be manifested, or the Divine within us may change the game and decide that they should not be manifested. But most of the time today's dream is tomorrow's reality.</p>
<p>Even in the ordinary world, if somebody wants to become a millionaire, he works for fifty years and then he becomes a millionaire. Fifty years ago it was a dream, but now it has become a reality. In the spiritual life, when you aspire you feel that you will realise and manifest God. These are all dreams. But they will be manifested realities in ten years or twenty years or in a few incarnations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each colour has a spiritual significance. In a dream you may not see any person or hear any words; you may just see flashes of light. When you see light in your dreams, you have to know that this light is going to enter into you and is going to manifest in you and through you. When you know the meaning of this light, immediately you will be able to interpret these dreams.</p>
<p>When you see a pure white colour in your dream, immediately you should know that divine purity and the divine consciousness of the Mother is entering into you. The universal Mother has all colours, but pure white light happens to be her dearest colour and it is through this colour that she manifests herself. So her consciousness will come as pure white light.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you see a pale blue colour, you have to know that it indicates infinity, spirituality, great power. Green indicates new life, vitality and dynamism. If you see green light, it means that new life has dawned. When you see the colour red, you will know that divine power is entering into you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does it mean when you see animals in your dream?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does it mean when you see animals in your dream?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No matter which plane of consciousness your dream comes from, if you see a deer and the deer is running, this indicates that you are running very fast in your spiritual life. If you see an elephant in a dream, no matter in which plane the dream takes place, you have to feel you are being energised with enormous strength in your spiritual life. If you see a dog biting you, this means that you have lost faith in your spiritual life, in your Master and in yourself. But if the dog is following you, this indicates that you have absolute faith in your Master and that you are your Master's obedient disciple. These animal-dreams generally take place in the vital world.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you a funny story. I had a disciple in New York who was a well-known psychiatrist. She analysed and interpreted dreams, and got paid thirty-five dollars for a half hour. She told everybody the significance of their dreams, but she could not interpret her own dreams.</p>
<p>Once she came to me and for two and a half hours she asked me about the significance of her dreams. Many of the dreams that she had were wonderful experiences in a very high spiritual world. When I told her their meaning, she started crying and creating a scene. In her dreams, she was able to recollect some of the experiences which she had had in a previous incarnation. In this incarnation she had hundreds of dreams which she was not able to analyse; but she was able to recollect experiences from her past incarnations in her dreams. Her husband was also very much interested in these dream worlds. They were both very well-known in their past incarnation, and in this incarnation she is most successful in her profession.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If one has a dream, will the events in it actually take place?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If one has a dream, will the events in it actually take place?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no hard and fast rule. You have to know what kind of dream you are having. Sometimes they are all imaginary dreams which come from the subconscient plane. Let us say that you want to eat chicken, but you don't get any. At night that desire may be transmitted into a dream and in the dream you will be eating a chicken. That kind of dream is not a real dream. It is only an unfulfilled desire which comes from the subconscient plane. We see these very often in the dream state.</p>
<p>Some dreams are strange. In the vital world, the consciousness is not pure, so dreams will be full of chaotic, mixed up, silly things. Those dreams are incidents that take place in the vital world.</p>
<p>But there are many good dreams, real dreams. These are harbingers of reality. Dreams are reality in another world above the physical world. If you have a good dream, take it as a reality. But if you have a bad dream, take it as a mental hallucination and just throw it away.</p>
<p>Sometimes the dreams are destroyed before they touch the physical world. On the way to the physical world they are destroyed in the vital plane; therefore they do not take place.</p>
<p>There are some dreams which do take place. These dreams we generally get in the small hours of the morning, between 4:00 and 5:00 or 5:30, at the <em>Brahma Muhurta,</em> or Hour of God. If you have dreams at that time, they are likely to materialism But these dreams have to be properly guarded against impure thoughts. Also, if you have dreams at a lunar eclipse or a solar eclipse, these dreams are usually fulfilled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do dreams materialise? Can they be prevented from doing so?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do dreams materialise? Can they be prevented from doing so?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many worlds. A dream is an incident that is taking place in the psychic world, the mental world, the vital world or some other world. When a person dreams in the mental world, the dream has to come to the vital world for manifestation before it comes to the physical world. The physical world is the last world in which we see it. It is like climbing down a tree. When the incident takes place in the mental world, after a short time it tries to come down to the vital level and from there it tries to come down to the physical level.</p>
<p>But it can happen that some incident may take place in the mental world which may never take place in the physical world. If the vital world resents it, it can prevent this incident from taking place. The vital is like a bodyguard, a soldier. If the vital allows it, then that particular incident eventually takes place in the physical also. Dreams need an opening to enter into the vital, and from there, if they get another opening, they enter into the physical. When the vital opens its door, the incident in the dream comes to the physical and materialises there. It is the same thing with diseases. If a disease first enters into the mind, the disease can be prevented from entering into the physical. First it takes place in the deeper or higher regions, and then when the vital allows it, it takes place in the gross physical. Very often we have dreams and do not recollect them in the morning; but the incident that took place is most authentic, and it will eventually materialise. Again, there are many things which do not actually first take shape or form in the mental or psychic world. Many incidents can come into being directly from the universal Consciousness. When the physical can expand its consciousness, like the wings of a bird, many things happen. It can draw experiences directly from the universal Consciousness, without passing through the mind or the vital. Also, if you want to negate anything in the mental world, you have to be able to enter into the universal Consciousness and draw energy from there. Once you have free access to the universal Consciousness, then you can go and fight in the mental plane and be successful there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When they smile, it is the soul expressing its joy in a visible way in the face. The psychic delight has taken full manifestation right in the face. First we feel joy which we may not even be aware of, then immediately it expresses itself right in our face.</p>
<p>Why does a baby cry? There are various reasons. At a particular hour he may be hungry or thirsty. Another reason, from the spiritual point of view, is that the child may be having a dream. A child between the ages of four and seven will have dreams almost every night. When <em>we</em> have dreams that are destructive, frightening or tormenting we do not usually cry aloud. We know that we will be alarmed only for a few minutes or seconds. But in the child's case, the child feels that he has been attacked, and he does not know what the attack is or when it is over. He is as helpless as a babe in the woods, and he feels that only if he cries aloud somebody will come to save him. I know a child who used to cry almost every night. He was not hungry or thirsty; he was only having dreams. Three nights I concentrated on that particular child to see what was actually happening, and I saw that it was a dream that was the cause of his suffering. But parents cannot prevent children from having dreams. Wise parents can only come and comfort the child.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, sometimes they are reminiscences of previous lives. Also, if brothers and sisters are fighting in the family, or if people in the neighbourhood are fighting, the vibrations remain in the atmosphere. Then a child suffers because he is the feeblest, the weakest, in the family. Consciously he does not even know of these fights, but if his parents are fighting or if his brothers and sisters are fighting, these wrong vibrations enter into the child's consciousness, and the child suffers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It only makes you feel that this is not your first or your last incarnation. You were something and you knew some people before. If they were not good people, then you will know better people in this incarnation. It encourages you in this way. If you have not done something in the past, you can do it now, and if you don't do it now, you can do it tomorrow. This is the purpose of reincarnation — so that if you have not done something, you will be given the opportunity to do it in another life.</p>
<p>If you saw an uninspiring person in the street yesterday and today in your dream you see that person again, what benefit do you get? When you saw him yesterday, you didn't get anything. By having a dream of that person, you still don't get anything. But if that particular person was very spiritual, sincere and aspiring, then you got inspiration from him when you saw him. And at night, if you see the same person in a dream, then you get additional inspiration. If you see aspiring people, it is a blessing. But if you see unaspiring people during the day, it is a waste of time, and if you see those people at night, it is also a waste of time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are self-explanatory. You have practised the <em>mandalas</em> and so you have had the vision of previous incarnations. Here is the proof that we have previous incarnations. Your soul is bringing to the fore people with whom you are connected.</p>
<p>The blue lotus that you have seen is the blue lotus of consciousness. Water is consciousness. A blue lotus is a sign of infinite Consciousness within us. When the lotus blooms petal by petal, it means that the seeker is entering into the infinite Consciousness. Blue signifies infinity and a lotus signifies consciousness. The infinite Consciousness is blossoming in the form of a blue lotus.</p>

Once during my sleep, I felt that Socrates and Ben Franklin were two incarnations of one soul. Can you trust a dream that seems so clear?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your own development. Today you are saying Socrates was Benjamin Franklin; tomorrow you may say that he was Aristotle or somebody else, and many names will go through your mind. If it is simply an ordinary dream or a kind of a flash, then please don't give any importance to it. But if it dawns like a vision, then you can say that it is something true, and you will derive benefit from it.</p>
<p>The spiritual life is something much deeper than the philosophic life. Philosophy can come right up to the door of God's Palace, but it cannot enter inside, whereas spirituality can enter into God's Palace. Philosophy helps; it creates a kind of higher reason. But the actual feeling of God, the feeling of becoming one with God, philosophy can never achieve. It is only our spiritual practice, our spiritual life, that can do this.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the relationship between our dreams and reality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the relationship between our dreams and reality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A dream that comes from the subconscious world, where we are quarrelling and fighting and doing many undivine things, will not necessarily materialise. But a dream that comes from the higher worlds is bound to materialise. Today's dream is tomorrow's reality. Why? Because the dream is coming from a world which is living and palpable. With our limited consciousness we do not know this. But when we meditate we consciously enter into many higher worlds, and the reality of these worlds enters into us in our dreams.</p>
<p>An ordinary man sees a dream as something totally separate from the rest of his life. He feels that he is living in the reality, whereas the dream has nothing to do with reality. It is something sweet, something precious, something encouraging, something inspiring and so forth, but he does not feel that it is more than that. But when a spiritual man has a dream, he immediately feels that his dream is the precursor of reality. He feels that each dream is a stepping-stone toward his divine Goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we have a dream from the lower worlds, we do not want to identify ourselves with it, for we are badly frightened by it. The dream comes to us as a threat. But a dream that comes from the higher worlds comes as an invitation. We get inner joy and inner satisfaction and immediately feel our identity there. Then we have to enter into it and grow into it.</p>
