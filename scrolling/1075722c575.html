<p><em>(1914. Calcutta. C.R. Das in his study with a friend. He is absorbed in reading the English version of one of the poems in his </em>Sagar Sangit/ <em>(Songs of the Sea)</em> rendered by Sri Aurobindo. He reads aloud.)/</p>

<p>All day within me only one music rings.<br /> I have become a lyre of helpless strings,<br /> And I am but a horn for thee to wind,<br /> O vast musician! Take me, all thy mind<br /> In light, in gloom, by day, by night express.<br /> Into me, minstrel, breathe thy mightiness.<br /> On solitary shores, in lonely skies,<br /> In night's huge sieges when the winds blow wild,<br /> In many a lovely land of mysteries,<br /> In many a shadowy realm, or where a child,<br /> Dawn, bright and young, sweet unripe thoughts conceives,<br /> Or through the indifferent calm desireless eves,<br /> In magic night and magic light of thee,<br /> Play on thy instrument, O Soul, O Sea.</p>

<p>C.R. DAS: Could any rendering be more beautiful than this? I, too, have attempted an English translation of the book. But mark the difference here between a born poet and a made poet. It can easily pass for original work, and as a true poet he has taken the liberty to improve upon the original in many places. To read his work is to enter into the splendour of Beauty that is Aurobindo. God has listened to my prayer. He had acted through me as an instrument in the Alipore Bomb Case and it was He who brought about Aurobindo's release. Aurobindo is now His chosen instrument in His Play to save man from himself, the world from itself and set up His own Empire upon earth. Who knows that, in the great work of His re-creation of Man, Aurobindo will not release into our minds, hearts and souls an Himalayan stream of divine poetry?</p>
<p>FRIEND: Your prevision strikes an echoing note in the depths of my heart. The days are not far off when you may hear a call to participate in his great undertaking.</p>

<p><em>(Aurobindo's house. Seated two of the inmates. March 29, 1914. Time: evening.)</em></p>
<p>A: Well, I have seen a new arrival from France meeting Aurobindo to-day. Do you know anything of her?</p>
<p>B: Only this much that in France she was carrying on Sadhana almost on Aurobindo's lines — of course, without knowing it; and, what's more, she had several visions of someone she called Sri Krishna!</p>
<p>A: Interesting! Wonderful, too! Then?</p>
<p>B: And the very moment she saw Aurobindo, she recognised him as the Krishna of her vision.</p>
<p>A: What predestination! This is the way the Divine does His work!</p>
<p>B: And you have marked how simple and affable she is as if she has come home to her own people.</p>
<p>A: That's my feeling too. Over and above that, she inspires regard.</p>
<p>B: Quite natural for her personality, for one who could see Aurobindo inwardly from across the seas and who could tread the path the Master has chalked out for us here.</p>
<p>A: I marvel at the coincidence.</p>
<p>B: We may marvel, without doubt. The coincidence seems a symbol of West joining East in a great synthesis.</p>
<p>A: That is exactly my feeling.</p>
<p>B: Let us put this question to the Master. Let us hear him on the point.</p>
<p>A: Very well. To-morrow itself, if possible.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: Anything you want to ask?</p>
<p>A: A little about the French lady who visited you yesterday, if you please.</p>
<p>B: The striking thing about her is that she seems to be home here among us, strangers, in a strange land in strange surroundings.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Long before her arrival here I had been aware of her. You will know her more and more from day to day. Even then she will be far above what you can know. As regards her being at home here, or in any other place, nothing would make any difference for her. She is in all the world and all the world is in her. In a large sense, she is an Indian soul born in a European body.</p>
<p>A and B: <em>(Almost in one voice)</em> A similar thought struck us yesterday — as if she would link up East and West in a golden chain.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> Yes, and much more.</p>

<p>B: I have had it and I am come to show it to you. The same thought was working in my mind, too. And happily I chanced to come across her and I seized the opportunity of sounding her on the point. And true to her simplicity and her kindness, she showed me her recorded view. Here it is <em>(He reads out)</em></p>

<p>A: Oh, a revelation! Read it again.</p>
<p>B: To be sure, it's a light to our blind eyes. It is God's Blessings received through her, We are infinitely blessed to have been at his feet. So is India, so is the world,</p>
<p>A: And the few words of Aurobindo about her are packed with a far-reaching significance.</p>
<p>B: Certainly. We have now come to a radical turn in the course of our life here.</p>

<p><em>(Pondicherry. Aurobindo's house. The Mother looking up the </em>Arya/ accounts, etc. Amrita comes in with a heap of the morning mail Placing it on Aurobindo's table, he lingers.)/</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Looking at Amrita)</em> Yes, Amrita?</p>
<p><em>(Amrita had the standing instructions of Aurobindo that he should remind him of the matter for the </em>Arya/ a week before the day fixed for going to press.)/</p>
<p>AMRITA: I am reminding you about matter for the <em>Arya</em>, please. Just seven days left.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Oh yes. Thank you. I'll set about it forthwith.</p>
<p>AMRITA: But once you sit at your desk you will forget everything else and go on till you finish. Why not dispose of the post first?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Very well. You are always business-like. That's all to the good.</p>
<p><em>(Running his eyes through the letters, one by one, he writes marginal notes, and stops short at one.)</em></p>
<p>Here's a reader of the <em>Arya</em> asking me how I, a literary man and a politician, could become all on a sudden an out-and-out philosopher! It has struck him rightly. I must write to him that I knew precious little about philosophy before I did the Yoga and came to Pondicherry, How did I manage to do it and why? Because X proposed to me to co-operate in a philosophical review — and my theory was that a Yogi ought to be able to turn his hand to anything ...</p>
<p>AMRITA: But it has never struck me as strange. Your articles, even your speeches, were at no time unmixed politics or pure literature. They have always been a happy blend of all the three, each at its best — I mean, politics, literature and philosophy, although the fire of love of country and her freedom predominated,</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But hasn't the <em>Arya</em> a different complexion altogether?</p>
<p>AMRITA: Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Then you concede that he is justified in asking me...</p>
<p>AMRITA: I do. Oh, that the man in question could see you filling page after page without halting anywhere, as if your very fingers were inspired!</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: But that is exactly the truth! Strange to say, a Power comes directly into the fingers, as if it did not have to pass through anything else! Just now I said that a Yogi should be able to turn his hand to anything. Well, the word "hand" can be applied in a very literal sense where the <em>Arya</em>-articles are concerned .</p>
<p>Now take these letters and make up replies from my marginal notes. Let me now start work.</p>

You wish to give me the charge of your Yoga, and I am willing to take it, that is to say, to give it to Him who is moving by his divine Shakti both you and myself, whether secretly or openly. But you must know the necessary result will be that you will have to follow that special way which He has given to me and which I call the integral Yoga."</p>

<p>Ah, here is the snag. Well, Sejda, have you ever moved back even by a single step from any difficulty in life?

<p>PUNAMCHAND: Before I settle down here as a permanent sadhak, may I have your permission to go home and come back with my wife?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Yes. What is Champaklal doing there? Bring Champaklal with you also.</p>
<p><em>(To Champaklal this remembrance of him by Sri Aurobindo and the spontaneous call to him are a most cherished memory. He first came to Sri Aurobindo in 1921 as a boy of 18. Now in 1923 he comes to stay for good.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The Mother and Champaklal)</em></p>
<p>CHAMPAKLAL: My Mother, I intend to wash my Father's dhoti.</p>
<p>MOTHER: I shall speak to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p><em>(Exit the Mother)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Sri Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: You want to wash my dhoti! People will laugh at you, joke about you, mock you. Are you ready?</p>
<p>CHAMPAKLAL: <em>(Firmly)</em> I am, Father.</p>

<p><em>(June 5, 1923. Sri Aurobindo and C.R. Das. Sri Aurobindo's residence, Pondicherry.)</em></p>
<p>C.R. DAS: A serious problem, Aurobindo.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: What is it?</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: I wish to take to spirituality.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: <em>(Smiling)</em> How can it be a problem at all?</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: It <em>is</em>, Aurobindo.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: How?</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: Politics dogs me night and day.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: But you know the two cannot normally go together. The aims and ideals of the usual political activity are almost always opposed to those of spirituality, to say nothing of the forces at work in politics...</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: Ah, you have understood my problem. Aurobindo, help me into the spiritual life.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I wish I could.</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: What prevents you, dear friend? Aurobindo, you are to me something far more than even a dear friend. And you know that.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Chitta, you must be aware that you cannot make satisfactory progress in your inner life if you do not move away altogether from absorption in politics. It influences the consciousness in a very undesirable way.</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: You are perfectly right. But ...</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I understand your difficulty. All right, then; you go on with your political activities, but at the same time do your best to live your inner life. Gradually you may find that your interest in politics is giving way to your interest in a higher life.</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: What a burden you have taken off my shoulders! I see a way of light and breathe in a little fresh air. But one thing more. I need your help also in another matter. Our "Swarajya Party" needs your unstinted support.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I feel strongly for it. I give its stand my full inner support. You will always feel my presence in it.</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: I feel doubly relieved. With your presence in me all will go well with me. Do you remember my prophecy about you at the Trial? — "His words will be echoed and re-echoed..."</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: But what would Norton think of you if he were to overhear you?</p>
<p>C.R. DAS: Oh, he is now a different man. He works hand in hand with me. He now appears against the Government in political cases.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Good that he is now on the side of the weak and the striving. His chivalry will pay.</p>

<p><em>(1923. Pondicherry. Sri Aurobindo's residence.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter T.V. Kapali Sastri, an eminent Sanskrit scholar of South India)</em></p>
<p>KAPALI: <em>(Bowing his head to Sri Aurobindo)</em> Sir, six years back when I first came to you I asked you about India's possibilities and you gave me an inspiring answer, 'not possibility but certainty.' This time you are giving me another inspiring thing — your golden complexion. It is no longer deep brown as before. In you, Yoga incarnate carries now its true complexion.</p>
<p>Now I have come, my mind made up once for all, to throw myself at your feet and upon your Grace for ever. Pray, how should I proceed in the first step of your Yoga?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: My Yoga aims at transformation of the whole being, not excluding the physical.</p>
<p>KAPALI: How and where to begin?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: One has to bring the Divine Consciousness right down into the very cells.</p>
<p>KAPALI: Too difficult even to think of. But I cannot try the too-hard so soon. I repeat, I throw myself at your feet and upon your Grace, now and for ever. Do with me as you please.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo gives a gracious smile and a nodding assent. With a parting pranam Kapali leaves the Master's presence, profoundly happy.)</em></p>

<p><em>(1925. Pondicherry. Naren Das Gupta visits Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Naren, how are you getting on with your Sadhana?</p>
<p>NAREN: My Sadhana! That you know better than I.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Of late I have received a number of letters about you from the Professor of English, Feni College. Some time ago, your indifference to earthly life and austere method of Sadhana caused much fear in your friends. Besides the Professor, others too have written to me of your exclusive absorption in Sadhana. Do you know what I have replied to them? I have asked them not to disturb you in any way, adding that all will be well.</p>
<p>NAREN: <em>(Shedding tears of delight)</em> They did all that! And received directions from you! I was all in the dark. Now I have a prayer.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: What is it?</p>
<p>NAREN: I wish to see the Mother before I leave for Bengal.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Ah, that's your prayer!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Sri Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>NAREN: <em>(To himself)</em> Oh my Guru, strange are your ways, more so is your affection for your sons. Pondicherry is a far cry from Feni. Your Grace and Presence nullify Space and Time.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the Mother)</em></p>
<p>NAREN: <em>(Prostrating himself before the Mother)</em> Mother, I must leave for Bengal.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: You must?</p>
<p>NAREN: <em>(Apologetically)</em> Yes, Mother. There is no other way.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: Why do you want to go?</p>
<p>NAREN: It's the family pull, Mother.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: How long will it go on?</p>
<p>NAREN: I am now going to pull the family here and leave it at your Feet.</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: <em>(With a compassionate smile)</em> That's fine.</p>

<p><em>(November 24, 1926. Amrita comes down from upstairs and starts informing the disciples of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo to assemble in the upstairs verandah facing the Prosperity room.</em></p>
<p><em>6:30 p.m. Barin, Nolini, Amrita, Purani, Champaklal, Pujalal, Rajani Palit ... Twenty-four all told are seated on mats.)</em></p>
<p><em>(7 p.m. Enter the Mother and Sri Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>NOLINI: <em>(Looking all around)</em> Satyen has not come. Shall I call him?</p>
<p>THE MOTHER: Yes, all, all.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo takes his seat in a low cushioned chair, while the Mother is on his foot-rest a few inches to the left. He stretches out his left hand over the Mother's head, and with the right begins to bless all the disciples who are bowing to him and the Mother, one after another. A complete silence. Sri Aurobindo looks Omniscience and Omnipotence. The Mother looks Eternal Love and Compassion.)</em></p>
<p>DATTA: <em>(Inspired)</em> "The Lord has descended. He has conquered death and sorrow. He has brought down Immortality."</p>
<p>RAJANI: <em>(In a whisper)</em> Barin-da, I have a special request. I am in a terrible fix.</p>
<p>BARIN: What is wrong?</p>
<p>RAJANI: I feel I am in Heaven. The pressure is simply unbearable. Please tell the Mother that I must tell her a few words.</p>
<p>BARIN: Rajani, you are not the only case. It is more or less the same with every one of us.</p>
<p>RAJANI: Maybe. But that is no concern of mine. I pray you to plead with the Mother for my sake.</p>
<p>BARIN: I'll try. More than that is beyond me to-day.</p>
<p>RAJANI: Barin-da, how I wish to hear from you what has actually happened to-day.</p>
<p>BARIN: Rajani, <em>(with a broad smile)</em> your Barin-da is as blind as you.</p>
