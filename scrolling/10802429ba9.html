  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes I feel that I regress just as I am beginning to make progress. Why is this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes I feel that I regress just as I am beginning to make progress. Why is this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know the saying, "Birds of a feather flock together." You have many friends. In the spiritual life also you need friends. Today you may be disappointed but there is someone, a friend, near you who will lift you up. Tomorrow you may have to lift her up. It is absolutely necessary to have spiritual friends. You can create friends overnight in the ordinary world. But to have a true spiritual friend is God's true blessing which you will treasure.</p>
<p>Sometimes in spite of your earnest aspiration to feed your soul, you don't have enough inner wealth. How are you going to buy the aspiration necessary to feed your soul? You have to go to a place where spiritual people are praying and meditating. They will help you immensely, and you will be able to help them. You will speak to them on the phone, you will be with them and mix with them, and you will see that you are throwing abundant light on their life of aspiration. If you feel that it is impossible to be under the guidance of a spiritual Master, you will need the company of spiritual friends.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will feel the necessity of finding someone who can consciously feed your soul, a spiritual Master. He has the capacity to feed your soul and when he does so, you will see that everything goes right. Your inner world is flooded with joy and delight. If you want to remain in the highest, purest joy, then you must follow the path of a spiritual Master. He makes a conscious promise to your soul and to your outer being that he is responsible for your outer and inner life. He will make you feel that the outer and the inner must go together. The inner must energise the entire being so that the outer will fulfil its role.</p>
<p>Yoga and life can never be separated. What life wants is fulfilment, and this takes millions of years. But if Yoga is accepted, it expedites the process. What would take twenty years to get, you can achieve in two years or even two seconds if you follow Yoga. Yoga means union with God's Will. Yoga greatly expedites realisation. Since God is omniscient and omnipotent, God can give you what He wishes in a matter of seconds. If you do not enter into the spiritual life, it will take you thousands of incarnations to realise God. But if you follow Yoga devotedly under the guidance of a God-realised spiritual Master, then in one or two or three incarnations you are bound to get realisation.</p>
<p>If you feel that your outer life is one thing and Yoga is something else, then you are making a Himalayan mistake. Yoga is conscious oneness with God's entire existence. So if you want to expedite your soul's journey and make faster progress in your outer life, as well as your inner life, Yoga is the answer. When God's Will becomes your will, you can achieve everything sooner than at once. If your will is not one with God's Will, then no matter how hard you work or how sincere you are, it will be impossible for you to attain to your highest.</p>
<p>In conclusion, you will never regress if you accept Yoga, the path of inner discipline. Union with God is the fulfilment of the soul in the inner life as well as in the outer life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get rid of your expectation by knowing that most of your expectations end not only in frustration, but also in self-destruction. Anything that attempts to destroy you is not healthy. So do not expect anything; just do the needful. Then you will get infinitely more than you expected. If you play the role of expectation, then at each moment you will want something more. If you do not expect anything, but only do what you feel is best, then your expectation will be fulfilled beyond your imagination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we invoke purity, all our vital problems can be solved. Purity, purity, purity. Purity is so important in the seeker's life. Nothing is as important as purity. Every day you should meditate on purity. If you practise breathing, every time you breathe in, try to repeat "Supreme" seven times. If you can't do it seven times, then you do it three times. When you are breathing out, again repeat "Supreme" three times. Each time you breathe in, if you can say "Supreme" three times, you will feel that you are bringing down universal Purity into your physical system. And while you are breathing out, feel that you are breathing out all your rubbish and ignorance. It helps considerably.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the worst impurity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the worst impurity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The worst impurity is a negative thought. When you are impure, you think, "I cannot do it. I cannot do the right thing. I cannot think of God or meditate on God. I cannot see the Light or the Truth." This is doubt. It is the worst possible impurity.</p>
<p>We always have to see the light in a positive way. I may say that I have light in a very tiny, infinitesimal measure. But if I say, "I don't have any light at all. All I have is darkness," then I am fooling myself. Again, if an ordinary human being says that he has abundant and boundless light, then he too is fooling himself.</p>
<p>If you think that you have no light at all and that you are all darkness, this is false modesty and self-deception. False modesty and self-deception will never lead us to God-realisation. If you constantly think, "I am impure, I am insincere," then you really become impure and insincere. Somebody may say to you, "I am impure," but when he says this, he feels in the back of his mind that he is at least one iota more sincere than his neighbour, his friend, or somebody else. He tries to make others think he is sincere by exercising his false modesty. In this way insincerity also comes from impurity. So insincerity, imperfection and negative thought are all forms of impurity.</p>
<p>When we see something inside ourselves, we try to exhibit it outwardly. If I have insincerity inwardly, then I demonstrate it outwardly also. That is to say, if I have insincerity inwardly, then I will take refuge outwardly in the house of insincerity. But if I am sincere and pure inside, then outwardly I will take shelter in the house of purity and sincerity.</p>
<p>So the worst impurity includes negative ways of thinking, insincerity and the feeling of unworthiness. All these negative qualities are self-imposed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we reinforce our spiritual aspiration when we feel it is wavering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we reinforce our spiritual aspiration when we feel it is wavering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When aspiration is wavering, there are various ways to reinforce it. When aspiration is wavering, we find it difficult to go deep within. We hate to meditate and even if we meditate, the meditation is not good. But what should we do at that time? We should read inspiring books written by God-realised souls or other seekers who are searching for God. Then we should feel that the seeker we are reading about is no one else but us. We should feel each idea, each thought or heart's cry of aspiration as our own. The writer has used his name, but it is our feeling that he has written about our own aspiration. We will see when we read the seeker's devoted writings that his cry is our cry. As he is going towards light, we should feel that we also want to go towards the light. Or if we read books by the Masters who are realised and who have become one with God's Consciousness, we will try to feel all the time that Compassion is being showered on our soul, our heart, mind and vital from his writings. We will feel that Compassion-light is descending on us when we are reading his book.</p>
<p>We have to know that the spiritual life is neither a bed of thorns nor a bed of roses. There are always deserts in life's journey. Everybody has to go through the desert in his aspiration; but there comes a time when there is no desert. It is light out now. The daylight is followed by night and again night by day. But the time comes in our inner aspiration when we enter into a deeper consciousness, a deeper being. We become one with our soul. When we are able to listen to the dictates of our soul, when we are in communion with God, then our consciousness is full of light. Each thought, each idea is full of light Then there is no night. It is all light. That is the very highest state.</p>
<p>When we are in an ordinary state, when we are seeking and crying and weeping, the best thing is to read the books of spiritual aspirants or Masters. Or we can mix with brother or sister disciples who are not having the same difficulties. Suppose that today we find it difficult to meditate. Then we can go to our brother or sister and they will lift us up. They will say something very good about the aspiration they saw in us about two months ago. Or they may say something about God or about our Guru that will lift us up. The same thing may happen to them sometime later and then they will come to us. To have brother and sister disciples is the greatest blessing for spiritual aspirants. There are seekers whose Gurus have left the body and who do not have sister and brother disciples. When their aspiration wanes, they stay at home and cry and weep, and eventually they are consoled. But the easiest way to get aspiration is to go to another disciple and he or she will elevate our consciousness. They will enter into us and bring out our own light, which has now been covered with depression, trouble, misery and anxiety.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I know if an inspiration comes from God or my heart or soul, rather than my mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I know if an inspiration comes from God or my heart or soul, rather than my mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you approach the Supreme with the mind, all the time you will doubt whether you are doing the right thing. At that time you will think, "Will He be nice to me? Will He be kind to me?" All these thoughts and ideas will come to you. If you get the inner message to see somebody — your boss or anybody — you will simply go and see that person. But if the inspiration is from the mind, before you see him, there will be many questions in your mind. Then, if you finally do see him and have not turned back, if the result does not come out according to your satisfaction, you will curse yourself and say, "No, it was not the right thing to do. I got the wrong message."</p>
<p>But if the message comes from the soul, I tell you, you will have tremendous conviction, and both success and failure you will take with the same satisfaction. You will feel this way because you got the message and you executed it. While you are executing the message, you will not expect anything in your own way. You will not expect that he will speak to you or you will get a particular thing done, no. Only you will do it, and then the result will come either in the form of success or failure. In this way you will be able to know if a message comes from within.</p>
<p>Sometimes some of you feel, "If God asked me to do this, how is it that I failed?" But you can fail even if you have done God's Will, because God may only be having an experience in and through you. Sometimes I ask you people to do something and you are not successful in doing it. Then you will say, "Guru was wrong." No, I was not wrong, but the Supreme wanted me to tell you to have an experience. If you feel that because I told you to do something, then you are bound to get success, you are mistaken. I always say that success is not what we are aiming at; we are aiming at progress. Your progress is to have faith in me, and my progress is to have faith in you and in the Supreme. Your faith in me is your progress and my faith that when I ask you to do something, you will do it — that is my progress.</p>
<p>So if you get the message from the heart, from the real heart which is identified with the soul, then I tell you the result will not bother you. Otherwise, if you get the message from the mind, then before you even act, hundreds of questions will enter into you. And if the result, according to your vision, is not satisfactory, then you will be puzzled. You may say that the message you got from the soul is false. But it is not false. Only it is an experience that God wants to have in and through you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we maintain a good standard consistently, instead of going up and down?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we maintain a good standard consistently, instead of going up and down?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel that every day is equally important. It is like this. Suppose a runner has to run one hundred metres in order to reach his goal. Now, after covering twenty metres at top speed, he feels that since he is running so fast, he is going to reach the goal in a second. Then relaxation comes. Then for ten or twenty metres if you watch his time, you will see that his speed has decreased considerably. Then again if he sees that some other runners are approaching him, if he comes to realise that his speed has fallen, at that time again he starts to run the fastest. But if the runner knows that once the starter has fired the gun, from the beginning to the end he has to maintain top speed, then only is he able to win the race; or, let us say he will really be pleased with his speed, he will be proud of his speed.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, what happens? Today you have done wonderful meditation and then you feel, "Oh, since today I have done such wonderful meditation, tomorrow I can relax." You feel that with today's meditation you will maintain the same speed tomorrow, but it does not happen in that way. Tomorrow again you have to make yourself feel that your new achievement has to be tremendous. Our difficulty is that when we do something well, we feel that we deserve some relaxation; otherwise, our satisfaction does not dawn. Satisfaction first dawns for us when we do something well and then when we don't do anything at all, we feel that still we deserve the same result. It is our due. But every day when we meditate, we have to feel that this is the last day for us. Tomorrow we are going to die. We know that we are in the Heart of the Eternal Supreme, the Infinite, but we have to feel that today is the last day for us to aspire, absolutely the last day. Today if we fail, then we will get zero. We will be out of the race. Then, when tomorrow comes, again we have to feel, "Today if I don't realise God, then I am gone. I am doomed. I shall have to wait for another five thousand years." This way if you aspire, then your sincerity will come to the fore. Always make yourself feel that today is absolutely the last day for your God-realisation.</p>
<p>The hour has struck. The teacher will give you only two hours to complete your examination. In two hours' time, even if you cannot complete your papers, still the examination is over. Then tomorrow, again you sit for the examination and you feel that tomorrow is the last day. But today while the teacher is giving you the examination, please don't feel that tomorrow again the teacher will give the same examination, that tomorrow again you will have the time to complete the examination. Once the teacher stands in front of you, feel that today is the last day. Either you pass or you fail. Today if you fail, then don't feel that tomorrow again you will sit for the examination. Absolutely forget about today's job. The past is gone. It is dead. You don't have to think about the future. Feel that the future also does not exist. If the future does not exist, if the past does not exist, then what exists for us? We have only the present. Here in the present we have to be either totally divine or we shall remain undivine, as we were yesterday. So, since we want to become divine, let us do the right thing. Let us make ourselves fit instruments. We have only today. Then again, when tomorrow comes. with a new hope we can say that today is a new day for us.</p>
<p>Always say, "Today is the only chance I have, absolutely the last chance." Then you are bound to get a good meditation. Otherwise, there is no goal. If you feel, "Oh, now I am only twenty-eight. At the age of seventy-eight I will realise God," then you will never realise God. Perhaps at the age of thirty or forty God will call you to the other side. When the time comes for you to go to the other world, whether you are seventy, eighty or ninety, it is up to God, you have to go. You don't know when it will be, so you should make yourself feel that today is the last day for you to achieve everything that you are supposed to achieve. Then, today if you fail, tomorrow again you have to feel that you have the same opportunity. But if you feel that the opportunity will again come and knock at your door, then you are lost. Today if you waste your aspiration or if you feel that you don't need aspiration because you have so many tomorrows, I tell you, before many tomorrows come, everything will be gone. But if today is the last day, then your sincerity, your aspiration, all your divine qualities will come to the fore. You want to reach the goal, you want to run so you will definitely reach the goal.</p>
