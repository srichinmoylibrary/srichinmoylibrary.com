<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody is not satisfied with the outer world, then he should have the inner hunger to enter and dive into the inner world. I have twenty or thirty disciples who once upon a time used to take drugs. They did many wrong things, but they found that this was not satisfying to them. Then they felt the inner hunger. They were starved with inner hunger and they came to me and entered into the life of aspiration. They wanted to see if there was any truth, any light, any fulfilment there. And when they entered into the inner life, they found the answer.</p>
<p>The individual has to see and feel if the outer life has satisfied him or not. If the outer life has failed him or disappointed him, at that time he may wake up and say, "This shore has disappointed me; now let me see what the other shore has to offer." So naturally he will try to enter into the inner world. Then, from inside he will bring forth his inner life. As we sow, so we reap. If I cry for light and dive deep with in, then I see the light and grow into the light. The light that I see and possess becomes part and parcel of my inner life. Then I try to bring that light to the fore and offer it to mankind. At that time, mankind receives according to its own receptivity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. If one has a sincere inner cry, then God will give him the light of patience. He who has accepted the inner life, the spiritual life, will be given enough patience.</p>
<p>The seekers who are now crying for light know that there are people who have already seen, felt and realised the light, so they are encouraged and inspired. If we dive deep within and follow the inner life, then sooner or later we shall also be inundated with light and peace. Peace of mind is bound to dawn at that time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can become truly humble only by discovering, by feeling and by knowing what true humility is. True humility is conscious awareness of the transcendental and universal Reality. True humility is God's supreme Nature manifested on earth in mankind and for mankind. Of all God's qualities, humility has no parallel.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have inner obedience?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have inner obedience?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many things I have told you to do inwardly. I have told you not to doubt God's existence, not to doubt me, not to doubt your own spirituality. Nevertheless, there are times when you doubt whether your own spiritual life is worth pursuing. There are times when you doubt whether you have done the right thing in accepting my path. Sometimes you are totally disgusted and you even say there is no such thing as God. You feel it would have been better if you did not believe in God, since others who are not practising the spiritual life are happy. If inwardly you behave in this way, that is called inner disobedience.</p>
<p>Disobedience is all inside the mind. If you doubt your own spiritual strength and capacity, if you doubt my capacity for offering you blessings, love and compassion, if you doubt God's unconditional Love, unconditional Forgiveness, unconditional Compassion, then it is all inner disobedience. I have told you that I am always there. God is our Eternity's beloved Supreme and I am His representative for those who are following my path. I am the captain and you are the soldiers. If you have faith in what I am saying and if you continue the spiritual life in this way, this is inner obedience. But this is all general. Everybody knows if he is obeying me and listening to my philosophy, if he is doubting himself or his own spiritual capacity. If you are not doubting my realisation or God's unconditional Compassion, Light and Bliss, then you have inner obedience.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I strengthen my devotion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I strengthen my devotion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before we enter into devotion we should pay attention to love-inner love, divine love. Devotion is fed by devoted love. If there is no love, then there can be no devotion. Ordinary human beings are attached to others. Why? Because human love is prompting them. In the spiritual life we use our devotion instead of attachment. If we want to strengthen our devotion to a cause, to our Master, to our own spiritual life or to God, then we have to feel the utmost necessity of love. We have to feel that we cannot exist on earth without loving our Master or the Supreme. If an aspirant feels that he cannot exist even for a brief second without loving his Master and being devoted to him, then automatically his devotion will be strengthened. Then he has to go one step ahead. He has to know why he is loving this person or this cause.</p>
<p>There are two ways to love God. One way is to please God according to our own way of seeing the truth. The other way is to devote ourselves to God and to please God in His own way. If an individual seeker wants to strengthen his devotion, he can do it in abundant measure if he has the inner strength, or capacity, or willingness to say, "I love God for God's sake. Him to please in His own way, I exist on earth." If this is the seeker's will, if this is what he wants from his life, then automatically God's adamantine Protection, unconditional Concern and unconditional Compassion will descend on that seeker. At that time the seeker's devotion to God or to any divine cause is bound to be strengthened in abundant measure.</p>

How can I overcome this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you find it difficult to bring down dynamic energy from above through meditation, no harm. You can become dynamic by repeating the word "dynamism." As soon as you utter the word "dynamism," you are bound to feel tremendous strength either in your arms, or in your other limbs, or in your head or in your heart. Each time you repeat the word "dynamism," a portion of your body will be surcharged with dynamism. Immediately you will feel a flow of dynamic energy in your legs, head, forehead, shoulders, or arms.</p>
<p>The word "dynamism" has tremendous power, like the word "peace." If you can soulfully say "peace," then automatically a part of your outer being will respond. And there will come a time when the inner being will also respond. Right now only a portion of you responds to the word 'dynamism'. But there will come a time when, from the sole of your foot to the top of your head, dynamism will flow when you repeat the word.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I become more sincere in my spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I become more sincere in my spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can become more sincere in your spiritual life just by feeling that sincerity gives you tremendous joy. Suppose you are about to say or do something wrong. Immediately stop and think, "How can I do this undivine thing? It will take away all my joy." Then you will not do it. You will find that by abstaining from some undivine activities, you are getting infinitely more joy than if you had allowed yourself to do something undivine. So it is joy that will always help you do the right thing. But you must distinguish between joy and pleasure. If you do something wrong and feel a kind of joy, then that is not real joy; that is pleasure. But if you do the right thing and then you get some joy, that is real, divine joy. Joy and pleasure are two different things. Pleasure is followed by frustration, but joy is followed by more joy, abundant joy, infinite joy. The real in us is joy; other things are all false. So if you don't do the right thing, the so-called joy that you get is nothing but undivine pleasure. But if you do the right thing, then you will get abiding, eternal joy.</p>
<p>Suppose you have told lies and you have not been caught by any human being. Still your conscience has caught you. Your conscience has caught you even before you told the lies. Then what do you do? On the one hand you are caught by your own conscience, so you feel miserable. On the other hand, you get tremendous joy because you have been caught. It is like hide-and-seek. When children play hide-and-seek, the one who is caught also gets joy. His motive is to hide, but when he is actually caught, he is so thrilled. In the spiritual life also, when you are caught by your divine qualities, you should be so happy that at last you have become aware of the tiger inside you. Previously you thought that inside you there was only a deer running very fast. Then, all of a sudden, you see inside you a tiger with all kinds of animal qualities. When you discover that you have a tiger inside you, you should be very happy. For only then will you be able to control the tiger. Otherwise, the tiger will come and devour all your good qualities.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, if there is no sincerity, nothing can be achieved. And to whom are you being sincere? You are being sincere to yourself. You have a higher reality and you have a lower reality. When you become sincere, immediately you pull your lower reality up to your higher reality. Just like a magnet, your higher reality pulls up your lower reality so that it can take shelter in the higher reality.</p>
<p>There are times in your life when you are really happy. Why are you happy? Because you are really sincere about jumping into the sea of spirituality. Again, you are unhappy when you are hesitant. At times you say, "Oh, if I jump into the sea of spirituality, there will perhaps be some water animals there, and these water animals will devour me." But instead of worrying about what will happen, you should say, "If I just jump, if I dive into the sea of spirituality, then I will be able to get the most precious gifts from the sea."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I grow more sincere in my spiritual search?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I grow more sincere in my spiritual search?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please try to remember the consequences in your life of insincerity. If you told a lie and were caught red-handed, then naturally you were embarrassed; you felt miserable. Anything that you did wrong in the past will have unfortunate consequences. Again, anything good, anything divine, that you have done will have good consequences. The joy that we get by being sincere is unparalleled. Real sincerity brings us boundless Joy and boundless Love from the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>We have to give due value to sincerity. Only if we value sincerity and give due importance to sincerity, will we be able to increase our sincerity.</p>
<p>If we see somebody is sincere, we may say, "I can also become sincere." But there is a great difference between saying "I can" and saying "I have become." Others do many things that we feel we can also do. We feel that it is only a matter of giving ourselves a chance. But we have to prove that we can do these things. In the ordinary, unaspiring life, there are many, many people who are sincere, even though they are not interested in following the spiritual life. So we feel that just because we are leading a spiritual life, sincerity is something that we can easily acquire. Only we don't do it.</p>
<p>But this is a mistake. It is very difficult to become sincere. It may take years to make sincerity a reality in our life. Our goal is God-realisation, which is still a far cry. We have to feel that, like God-realisation, total sincerity is also very difficult to achieve. If we have total sincerity for God's Will, then we are on the verge of God-realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sincerity means constantly living in the presence of light; that is to say, seeing light within and without at every moment. If you feel light and see light constantly, then automatically sincerity grows. But in order to see and feel light within us, we have to make the mind calm and quiet. If the mind is restless, then we can never be sincere in the purest sense of the term. At that time, from the highest point of view, we are bound to be insincere. If the mind is wanting in peace, then there will be many waves and surges of falsehood inside the mind-sea. These waves have to be brought under control through aspiration. Otherwise, no matter how many years we practise the spiritual life, there is no sure guarantee that we will become sincere.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can a seeker do to become sincere?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can a seeker do to become sincere?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each human being on earth has some sincerity, because inside each individual God abides. God has all divine qualities. Just because God is within us, God's divine qualities have to be in us. We cannot separate God from His qualities. So sincerity is also within us. But we can develop this quality, just as an athlete develops his muscles, by exercise.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker has definitely been sincere many times in his life. Let us say that an ordinary seeker is sincere for one day and for ten days he is insincere. What happened the day he was sincere? No matter what happened, even if he failed in some examination, he was happy. But the moment he became insincere, even when he achieved so-called success in his life, he was not happy. Something inside him was missing. Insincerity always means dissatisfaction. The sincere seeker tries to succeed in the battlefield of life. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he fails. If he fails he says, "God, I have tried, but You did not appear before me in the form of success. You came in the form of failure." But the sincere seeker knows that whatever happens will offer him some kind of satisfaction. But when he is not sincere, there is no satisfaction, even if he succeeds.</p>
<p>How can we become sincere? We can become sincere when we know that there is something which comes first and foremost in our life. If a seeker considers his physical body and his own existence as first and foremost in his life, then he is mistaken. God has to be the first and foremost thing in his life.Early in the morning, before the seeker starts his day, if he does the first thing first, he will pray to God to make him what God wants him to be and give him what God wants him to receive and achieve. If he does this, then naturally God will give him everything. If he is wanting in sincerity, then God will give him sincerity. If he is wanting in peace, then God will give him peace. Anything that he lacks, God will grant him. But he has to do the first thing first. When the day dawns he has to pray to God to give him what God wants him to have and not what he himself wants.</p>
<p>If he wants two cars or three cars, he will have only frustration because he is in the desire-world. No matter what his achievement may be in the material world, he will not be satisfied. But if he prays to God to give him what God wants to give him, then God will give him peace of mind and Love, boundless Love. From this boundless Love, he is definitely going to get satisfaction.</p>
<p>If we want sincerity, let us go to the One who has Sincerity in infinite measure. Let us go to Him instead of going to somebody else. If we pray and meditate early in the morning, then naturally God will grant us the thing that we need. He always wants to give us the thing that will be soulful and fruitful in our life. If God thinks that sincerity is what we need, then definitely He will flood our outer life with sincerity. The seeker has to pray not for the fulfilment of his desire-life, but for the manifestation of God-satisfaction in his life of aspiration. Then he will reach the ultimate goal, which is the inner sincerity that he is longing for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one discern his sincerity in the beginning? What certitude does he have that he is sincere?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one discern his sincerity in the beginning? What certitude does he have that he is sincere?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We always know whether we are sincere or not. Sincerity is not something that we have to be taught; it comes from deep within. When something comes to the fore from the inmost recesses of our heart, we are bound to be sincere. But very often something comes from the mind, which is constantly negating itself. This moment we think that it is true and we fight for it, but the next moment we discover that it is absolutely false. When our own realisation is so dubious, we cannot build on it. At that time what we do and say becomes all insincere.</p>
<p>If our focus of concentration is in the heart and not in the mind, then what comes to the fore will be all sincerity. Inside the heart is the soul, and what comes from the soul cannot be anything but a flood of sincerity. More than that, it is also a flood of spirituality. Through the heart, the soul speaks most powerfully and convincingly.</p>
<p>If we spend more time in our heart than in our mind, then we are bound to know what sincerity is. Inside our heart we have an inner vessel and this vessel is every day filled by God's Purity. There we can grow. When our existence grows there, then we will see that we are collecting a bumper crop of sincerity every day.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we achieve sincerity and perfection in our nature?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we achieve sincerity and perfection in our nature?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we want to be absolutely sincere when we do something, we have to do that thing with utmost purity, without any motive behind it. We will perform the action with utmost sincerity, and while we are doing it we have to feel that our action is flooded with purity. When we do something sincerely, in our action there must be purity. Purity has to flood our sincerity. Then, while we are acting, we have to feel that this very act is being done in and through us by a far higher Power.</p>
<p>Let us call this higher Power our Inner Pilot. While the Inner Pilot is acting in and through us, we have to be most grateful to Him precisely because He is utilising us in this way. He could have utilised somebody else. Today He is accepting us, but tomorrow He could throw us aside if we don't please Him in His own way. So we have to be very grateful that He has chosen us and not somebody else. We have to offer our constant gratitude to the Inner Pilot, and at the same time, we have to feel that the result of our action does not belong to us. It will come to the fore in the form of failure or success, but since we are not the doer, we are not bound by the result. So immediately we will offer the result of our action to the Inner Pilot. While He is utilising us, we have to feel that we will give our body, vital, mind, heart and soul to the cause for which He has chosen us and make ourselves worthy of His Divine Grace. When we can combine all these devoted attitudes in our nature while the Inner Pilot is acting in and through us, then only can perfect Perfection dawn in our nature. When we do something unique in our life of aspiration, then perfect Perfection automatically dawns.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between purity and sincerity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between purity and sincerity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sincerity begins in the finite and goes to the Infinite. Sincerity is of the mind. It begins in the mind and then it expands in the vital and in the physical. On the other hand, purity is in the heart, of the heart and for the heart. Purity embodies God, the real Reality. Purity eternally is. Purity existed the day God created His Vision. God's Vision and purity go together. We cannot separate them.</p>
<p>Sincerity is the door. But if you do not have the key, which is purity, how can you open the door? You have to come to the door with sincerity. Then with the purity-key you can open the door. So purity is everything. If you do not discover purity, then no matter how sincere you are, you will not succeed. In purity, sincerity grows. Sincerity, like a muscle, can be developed. But eventually purity and sincerity must go together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can purity be had overnight?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can purity be had overnight?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. As we cannot have realisation overnight, also we cannot have purity overnight. It is impossible, impossible, impossible. Your elder brother has been studying for nineteen or twenty years to get his Master's degree. If you are in kindergarten, you cannot get your Master's degree in one day. But again, impossibility exists only in our human world. If the Supreme wants to give you purity overnight, do you think that anybody on earth can prevent you from receiving it? The Miracle-Capacity of the Supreme does exist, but as a general rule He manifests His Reality through gradual progress. Each rule admits of exception, but that kind of exception we very rarely see.</p>
<p>Purity is like a muscle, that can be built up through exercise and practice. You need many years of practice and also God's Grace. If you try to achieve purity, certainly you will get it. If you don't get it today, you will get it in ten years or in your next incarnation. Total purity in the physical, the vital and the mind takes time. You are crying for purity in the heart. You may get it in a few days or a few months, let us say. But it takes more time to get purity in the mind. In the vital it is still more difficult. In the physical, God alone knows how many years it takes. Comparatively it is much easier to get purity inside the heart. The soul is all pure so if you identify with the soul, at that time you are all pure. There you are purity itself. Then from there you are drawing a little bit of purity into the heart. The heart gets it very easily. The heart is like the first room, the mind is the second room, the vital is the third room and the physical is the fourth room. When the flow starts, naturally the heart will be purified before the other members.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between patience and lack of aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between patience and lack of aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do something and then they wait for the result. A farmer sows the seed; then he waits for rain. After three months, four months, or six months, he gets the result. You study something and then you wait with patience to see if you passed the examination. Some people won't do anything, but they expect a result. That is a false way of utilising patience. Patience says, "I will do my part in the spiritual life and place the result at the Feet of the Supreme. Whether He gives me success or failure, is all up to Him."</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, unaspiring life, there is no action. If there is no action, there is no need for patience. It is only surrender to ignorance. When we don't aspire, there is only our conscious surrender to ignorance. We hope for something or expect something from the world, but how can we expect anything if we don't aspire? It is only stupidity. But when we do aspire, then we can expect a result, and the result will come either in the form of success or failure, according to God's Will.</p>
