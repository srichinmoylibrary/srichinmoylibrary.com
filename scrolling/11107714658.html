<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the field of manifestation, God is everywhere. God is in pure water and He is in filthy water. Why do you drink pure water and not filthy water? Because you know you will get sick if you drink filthy water. Similarly, we have to know what things are necessary for us to reach our Goal. God is in everything, but what we cannot utilise in our journey has no place in our aspiring consciousness. If the animal quality is obstructing our way, then we have either to illumine it or to destroy it. Our philosophy is the philosophy of acceptance. One has to accept life as it is and then try to transform and illumine it. In the Yoga of acceptance, we do not destroy anything; we transform it. When we transform something, it loses its original unlit, destructive quality. When night is transformed into light, you will see the total extinction of night, because all becomes light. It is the same with the animal in us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This can be done and is being done every day by those who follow the path of Yoga and spiritual discipline. Yoga means union, conscious union with God. We are one with the Self, but we are not now aware of it. We can be aware of it only when we consciously practise spirituality; and for that we need aspiration. When we are marching along the path of aspiration, our Spirit will automatically blend with our physical being and the physical being will devotedly listen to the dictates of the Self. Then we will see that our inner life and our outer life have become totally one. At that time one complements the other; one fulfils the other. The inner life becomes the embodiment of the Truth and the outer life becomes the manifestation of the Truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you speak about your inner experiences, you will run into difficulty. The soil has to be fertile. If people are genuine and sincere, your conversation will then be fruitful. Otherwise, they will have every right to misunderstand and ridicule you. You may not mind if someone mocks you, but the person who has not benefited or been inspired by what you said may unfortunately try to block your own inspiration and aspiration. So we should use our wisdom and say that he is also God's child; let the moment of his awakening come at God's choice Hour. It is not our business to awaken him. When someone is ready, crying for a higher life then it is our business to awaken him from the sleep which is ignorance.</p>
<p>If you give a thousand dollar bill to a child he will tear it up. For him there is no value in it. But a grownup will know the value of a thousand dollars. Similarly when you share your inner experiences with an aspirant or seeker he will benefit by it. He knows how difficult it is to have an inner experience. Those who really cry for the inner life are the right persons to share your experiences with.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life, we have to know that there is no end to our journey, because God is not and cannot be satisfied with any particular standard. Today's dream will transform itself into tomorrow's reality. But again, tomorrow's reality will be meaningless in comparison with the reality we are aiming at the following day. There is no end to our reality, because we have the infinite Divine within us constantly. It is our goal to change the face of reality from bright, to brighter, to brightest and from high, to higher, to highest. Even in the highest, the reality has to go beyond, beyond, beyond, because God does not, cannot and will not ever accept any end to His creation. For creation is His progress, His own movement and God wants endless progress in infinite ways.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can a realised soul manifest himself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can a realised soul manifest himself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A realised soul is like an expert climber. He has climbed a tree and he has the capacity to stay on the topmost branch or to come down and touch the foot of the tree. The subconscious mind is the foot of the tree and above that are the physical mind, the intuitive mind, the illumined mind, the overmind, the supermind. A realised soul enters into the highest level of consciousness on the strength of his inner realisation. Then again he has to come down into the subconscious plane of the disciples for his manifestation. If you live on the top of the tree all the time, you cannot fulfil God's Dream on earth. The tree is complete, the tree is whole because it has the roots, it has the trunk, it has the branches, it has leaves, fruits, flowers and all the other different members of its family. A realised soul enters into the Highest and again he has to enter into the lowest in his spiritual disciples to work for their nature's transformation and for God's manifestation. If there is no manifestation, then he is incomplete.</p>
<p>There are many Indian spiritual Masters who have accepted life, but again there have been spiritual Masters who negated the world, who did not care for the world. They wanted their own Self-realisation and when they got it they said good-bye to the world. Those who accepted the world said, "The world is within me. Unless and until the world is perfected, how can I be perfect?" Unless perfect Perfection dawns on earth, God's Vision is not manifested. God's Vision can be transformed into Reality only when the earth-consciousness is totally transformed. In order to transform the earth-consciousness, man has to aspire, physically, vitally, mentally, psychically and spiritually. So we must not negate the body. The Indian spiritual Masters who did not care for the body at all said, "Meditate, remain in the other world, realise God and then leave the body." But if you love God and if you really want to serve God, then here on earth is the golden opportunity to manifest Him and fulfil Him. If you get your realisation and you say to God, "I don't want to work for You. I'm tired, exhausted, totally exhausted, now I want to take rest," God may allow you to take rest. But in the case of a real divine hero, he will say, "I have worked hard, but now I wish to offer the fruits of my realisation to the world at large. Then God will say, "Work here. Do it."</p>
<p>Our path is the path of acceptance. Acceptance of what? Acceptance of this material world. While operating in matter, Spirit has to sing the song of Immortality. The material life and the spiritual life must run together. The material life can be perfected only by listening to the inner dictates of the soul. We have to accept the world as it is, but we must not think that the world has completed its task. No. Far from it. We have to work and work for the earth-consciousness. We have to free it from limitations, imperfections, bondage and ignorance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any reason why the majority of souls seem to want manifestation and few souls want oneness or perfection?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any reason why the majority of souls seem to want manifestation and few souls want oneness or perfection?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are seeing that the majority here today care most for manifestation, but when we consider all our Centres perhaps as many people also care for the other qualities. But let us say that, granted, people care more for manifestation. What is meant by manifestation? Manifestation means revelation. The soul uses the dynamic vital for manifestation. We think that without the body we cannot manifest. That is true, but we have to know that without the vital, either the dynamic vital or the aggressive vital, we cannot manifest anything.</p>
<p>It is the vital push that compels the physical to work. If a person is restless, we say that his body is making the movement. But actually the movement is coming from his vital. Leave the body alone and you will see that it is all inertia. The body has very, very, very limited light. In the dynamic vital there is a little light. And in the aspiring mind there is more light. In the psychic heart there is abundant light. People are caring more for manifestation because through their ambition, all individuals want to do something. There are very few people on earth who do not want to do something. Yes, they may sit quietly because they are lazy by nature. But if somebody does something remarkable, immediately desire comes into them and they say, "Oh, if I only could do that!" When we are in the spiritual life, we do not do that. If we see that somebody has done something extraordinary, we do not envy him. Either we feel that it is we who have done it and we become one with his real spiritual life, or we feel: "It is good for him, but for me something else is necessary; something else will give me more joy. He is the best runner and I am the best singer," or "I am an aspirant. Let me try to be the best aspirant and let him remain the best singer or best runner." In that way we are freeing ourselves. We are not competing with anyone. But in the ordinary life, when an absolutely lazy man who won't budge an inch goes to a football match and sees how dynamic the players are, he thinks, "How I wish to be that kind of player!" Look at this! Only one hour before, he said that rest is the most important thing, his most favourite thing but right now he sees these people kicking a ball and he wants to do that. Now he wants to manifest himself in football.</p>
<p>That is how it is for ordinary human beings. The vital immediately wants to do something, although it knows that the body does not care for the action. Consciously, the individual does not know that his body does not care to do something and his soul does not care to do it; but the moment he sees that somebody has achieved something, he says, "I also have to become that." All day and night, he has been sleeping, resting; he has been in another world. But when he sees somebody's achievement, immediately he becomes greedy and feels that he also has to do the same thing.</p>
<p>But spiritual people don't do this. They enjoy, but they feel that they have their own goal; or they become one with the doers. When I see that somebody is running the fastest, I really feel that I am the fastest runner. Ask me to run with the fastest runner and I will be nowhere. But when the person runs, I get such joy because I feel that it is I who have run the fastest. Or as a seeker, I will say that his goal is to become the fastest runner and my goal is to realise God. In that way, the seeker in me is safe. But ordinary men won't act like that. They will operate in their vital. They will do nothing and, at the same time, the moment they see somebody else achieve something, immediately they will try to grab it. Without working they want to get the same name and fame the same admiration, which is impossible. That is what the manifestation is like for ordinary, unaspiring people. But for the sincerely aspiring people, it is different.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My philosophy is the absolute acceptance of life. Life has to be accepted. In this life there is the living Breath of God. God is not only in Heaven, He is within us as well. God and His creation can never be separated.</p>
<p>My message is this: If we really think of God, if we feel the existence of God, then we have to accept the world as real, just as God is real.</p>
<p>First we have to accept the world as it is. If we do not accept the world, then what are we going to change? What are we going to transform? If a potter does not accept his clay, then how is he going to shape and mould a pot? We have to aspire to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss for the world. We have to enter into the very breath of life in humanity in order to transform and change the face of earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This path is the easiest, the safest and the swiftest. If you say that those who are isolated, those who enter into the Himalayan caves and neglect society will find less difficulty in realising God, granted. But if they do not accept humanity, what do they ultimately gain? If our plot of land is very tiny, only one acre, then our crop will also be tiny. But if we have much land and the capacity and materials to cultivate it then we are bound to get a bumper crop. We are bound to get a bumper crop of realisation in infinite measure because we have accepted humanity.</p>
<p>If I love my Father, and if I see that my brothers and sisters have not yet realised Him, then what will I do? I will give my light, my achievement, to my brothers and sisters. That the world has to be relinquished — this is an old Indian theory which is absolutely wrong. Today you will renounce the world, tomorrow you will renounce your family members and the day after tomorrow you will renounce yourself. Then what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Our path is undoubtedly the path of heroes, of divine warriors. We have to fight against doubt, worry, fear, obstruction, limitation, imperfection, bondage and death. But if we really love God, then nothing is difficult. Everything becomes very secure and safe. This is the easiest and most fulfilling path for the sincere, for the totally dedicated, for the brave souls who are ready to walk, march, run and fly along the path of Eternity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do not agree with us that aspiration and manifestation can go together. If they don't believe us, then I have to remain millions of miles away from them. If an individual says he does not believe in manifestation, that he believes only in aspiration, then he is not following my philosophy. If any of my disciples feel that they want only realisation and not manifestation, I wish to say that realisation is helpless without manifestation. They go together. Some people are more than eager and anxious to manifest, but a few have a wrong conception of our spiritual life. Let us feel always that aspiration and manifestation not only can but must go together. Like the right eye and the left eye, they both are needed. When both eyes function properly we can see the world. If one eye is defective, then we are half blind. Take aspiration and manifestation in that light. One eye is aspiration, the other eye is manifestation. We need both in order to be complete.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Perfection-Goal</h2>

<p>Perfection is the seeker's fulfilling realisation and fulfilled manifestation. Everything else has dawned on earth save perfection, perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is the tree.</p>
<p>Perfect Perfection is the fruit.</p>
<p>Man's speculation about perfection is his ignorance. Man's concentration on perfection is his knowledge. Man's meditation on perfection is his wisdom. Man's contemplation on perfection is his world-illumining, world-transforming inner eye.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is temptation.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is frustration.</p>
<p>God's Message is Perfection. Man's message is destruction.</p>
<p>Perfection-Goal and the freedom-soul go together. He who reaches the state of freedom-soul has conquered his inner life and immortalised his outer life. He is the chosen instrument of God. He is the direct channel of God. He is the representative of God here on earth.</p>
<p>Cry and try.</p>
<p>When we cry to see the transcendental Light and when we try to perfect our outer nature, our perfection does not remain a far cry. Perfection is ours.</p>
<p>Exert and control.</p>
<p>When we exert the divine in us and control the animal in us, perfection begins to dawn within us. The flower of perfection blooms.</p>
<p>See and be.</p>
<p>When we try to see the truth with the Eye of God, not with our own eyes, and when we consciously try to be the surrendered instrument of God, perfection in no time dawns. The Golden All of perfection beckons our aspiring hearts. It is true that perfection cannot be achieved overnight. Realisation cannot be achieved all at once. It takes time.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story. A young seeker once came up to a spiritual Master for initiation, and was duly initiated. Then the following day he said, "Master, now that you have initiated me, you have to give me realisation. I want to see God."</p>
<p>The Master said, "My child, how is it possible for you to realise God in one day?"</p>
<p>Two days later, he said, "Oh, I want to realise God."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You are not ready."</p>
<p>A few days later, again the same request: "Master, I want to realise God." He had not completed his task. He had not launched into the spiritual path properly. Just the other day the Master had initiated him, but now he was crying for realisation without following the proper method. Without swimming in the sea of aspiration, he wanted to realise God.</p>
<p>On his way to the Ganges for a dip, the Master invited this particular disciple to come with him. As the two entered the water, the Master pressed the disciple's head underwater for a couple of minutes. When he released it, the Master asked, "What did you feel when I was pressing your head into the water?"</p>
<p>"Master, I was gasping for air. I was practically dying and I thought I would not survive. The moment you released me, I got my life back." The Master said, "If you can come to that same state of consciousness and feel that without God you cannot live even for a few minutes, you will realise God. You will realise God at that moment on the strength of your highest aspiration. Your brightest inner flame has to be kindled, and then you have to cry — cry for God as a child cries for his mother. Only then is God-realisation possible.</p>
<p>The disciple learned the lesson. Truly and soulfully he entered into the spiritual life and listened to all his Master's dictates. Wholeheartedly he launched into the spiritual life. He felt the necessity of freedom from the domain of desires. He felt the necessity to grow into the mounting flame of aspiration, constant aspiration. Then realisation for him was not a far cry. He did realise God.</p>
<p>When we use the term 'Heaven', we feel that Heaven is all light, delight and perfection. But where is that Heaven? It is deep within us, in the inmost recesses of our hearts. High Heaven, higher Heaven and highest Heaven are all within us.</p>
<p>When we offer our soulful thoughts to our brothers and sisters, we live in high Heaven.</p>
<p>When we offer the results of our soulful actions to mankind, we live in higher Heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, when we offer our soulful existence to humanity at large, unreservedly and unconditionally, we live in the highest Heaven.</p>
<p>We can live in the highest Heaven every day. God has given us the capacity. He has given us the potentiality. It is we who have to manifest our inner potentiality and capacity. We are all surcharged with indomitable inner courage. Unfortunately, we do not use our inner unlimited capacity. We use our outer limited capacity. We are afraid of diving deep within. Inside is the treasure. Inside is the key. We do not know where we have put the key. We have totally forgotten. We do not know where the treasure lies.</p>
<p>At this point we see the need for a spiritual Master who knows where the key is and where the treasure lies. He does not give something of his own to the seeker. He only brings to the fore the seeker's inner wealth. God-realisation is not his sole monopoly. Everybody will realise God, without fail. It is a matter of time. One realises God today on the strength of his inner inspiration. Another realises God tomorrow on the strength of his sincere aspiration. Everybody will realise God at God's choice Hour. Again, those of us who are sincere seekers can expedite our journey. We can walk towards our goal. We can march towards our goal. We can run towards our goal. If we run, naturally we shall reach the goal sooner than those who are walking towards their destination.</p>
<p>Perfection-Goal. Perfect Perfection here on earth has to be manifested, but how? We have to start our journey with inspiration. We have to feel every day deep within us in all our activities the necessity of inspiration. Without inspiration there can be no proper achievement. Then we have to go one step further. After inspiration we have to feel the momentous necessity of aspiration. Inspiration is not all. We have to aspire to reach the Golden All, to see the golden Shores of the Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. This is what we expect from aspiration, the mounting flame within us.</p>
<p>But aspiration is not enough either. We have to meditate. Aspiration includes meditation. When we meditate, we have to feel that we are entering into Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. These are not vague terms, but our true possessions. To some day enter into our own divine possessions — Infinity, Eternity and Immortality — is our birthright.</p>
<p>Then, when we become advanced in our meditation, when meditation starts offering us its fruit, we enter the realm of realisation. We realise the highest Truth in this body, here on earth. We do not have to go elsewhere to realise God. We do not have to enter a Himalayan cave or sit on a snowcapped mountain in order to practise spirituality. No. Here on earth, in the hustle and bustle of life, we have to practise spirituality. We have to accept earth as it stands, as it is. If we are afraid of earth, if we shy away from earth, then God-realisation will always remain a far cry. Here on earth we have to realise the highest Truth.</p>
<p>But even realisation is not enough. After realisation we have to reveal our realisation. If we do not reveal our realisation, we act like a miser, hoarding our treasure. This is not right. We have to offer our realisation in the form of revelation to mankind.</p>
<p>Yet revelation is not enough either. We have to enter into the domain of manifestation. If we do not manifest what we have realised here on earth, if Mother Earth does not receive the fruit of our realisation, and if she does not have it for good, we can never be truly fulfilled. Mother Earth has to be fed with the fruit of our realisation. Here on earth the manifestation of realisation has to take place; and when manifestation takes place, perfection is bound to dawn. Perfect Perfection is nothing other than the absolute manifestation of God's transcendental will here on earth.</p>
<p>We are all seekers of the infinite Truth. It is our bounden duty to rise high, higher, highest. Each human being has come into the world with the message of perfection. No human being on earth will remain unrealised. No human being on earth will remain unfulfilled. No human being on earth will remain imperfect.</p>
<p>Realisation, fulfilment and perfection: these are three brothers. Realisation is the youngest, fulfilment is the middle and perfect Perfection is the eldest in the family. These three brothers must go together. They have to walk along the field of aspiration. They have to swim in the sea of meditation. They have to fly in the sky, the blue welkin of contemplation. God-Realisation, God-Revelation and God-Manifestation can take place only when man feels that he has to transcend himself. His goal of today is not the ultimate Goal. Today's goal has to be transcended tomorrow. Today's goal is the foundation-stone. Every moment we have to transcend ourselves and, while transcending, deep within us we shall cherish the message of perfection.</p>
<p>Perfection is bound to loom large and important in all our activities if we feel that aspiration is the only thing we need, the only thing we are striving for. In aspiration lies the key that can ultimately open up the door of perfect Perfection.</p>
