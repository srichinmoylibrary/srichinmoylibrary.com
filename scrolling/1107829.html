 <p></p>
<h2>Simplicity and stupidity</h2>

<p>The Master was speaking to a few of his disciples on the birthday of one of their spiritual brothers whose name was Rabi.</p>
<p>"Here there are many who are jealous of Rabi. When they see him running in the street to come to me or to get something for me, they become jealous. But at the same time, if I ask them to do what he is doing, they won't do it. Some people become jealous because they are not given the opportunity to bring food for me or to beg for money from door to door. Again, some people become jealous even if someone does a bad thing, if he becomes infamous or notorious. If someone has become a thief of the first order, the other person does not want to become a thief, but he wants to get the name and fame that the thief has got. He wants everybody to know who he is. This is human life. People want to get name and fame in any way, even in a negative way. There are some disciples who don't want to take the trouble to work, but they want to get name and fame.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, Rabi is not of that type, but sometimes his stupidity digs a grave for me; then I have to come out of the grave. Now, spirituality is not stupidity. One of India's greatest scholars said that he could mix with many people, only he could not mix with one person in God's creation, and that was a fool. If you remain with a fool, then no matter how guarded you are, you will one day be totally ruined.</p>
<p>"So don't act like a stupid fellow, Rabi, but remain always simple. Spirituality is simplicity. Just because you try to please me, that doesn't mean that you can act like a really stupid fellow. People may forgive you, but they will not forget you. You have written in letters of gold in their hearts: 'Rabi is a first class fool.' Once it is registered in their brain that you are really a stupid fellow, then no matter what you do for them, even if you give your life for them, they will not get the same kind of joy. Stupid people should be kept at arm's length. So act like a simple man, not a stupid man.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you act in a stupid manner, Rabi, even while you are fully conscious of the fact that you are acting like a stupid person. You are trying to gain the sympathy of others by your stupidity, which is very bad. If your behaviour is a pretense to draw sympathy from others, if you do it intentionally, then you are acting like a rogue. As I said before, there are many things which they will forgive, but they won't forget. If they don't forget the incident, then what kind of forgiveness will they have? Where is forgiveness? Forgiveness is in total oblivion. If you remember an incident, then you do not forgive the person totally.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, it happens sometimes that you know perfectly well that you are acting like a stupid fellow, because some people get a kind of innocent pleasure — or perhaps it is a malicious pleasure — by acting like a circus clown. When you enjoy this kind of action, then you are acting unconsciously like a rogue. When you treasure stupidity because others are making fun of you and getting joy, then you have to know that some part of your existence cherishes ignorance, which is undivine. You pretend that you do not know what you are doing. That amounts to a very bad quality.</p>
<p>"Here everybody is a culprit: we all have bad qualities. But in your case I am telling you your bad qualities frankly so that everybody can learn. Don't pretend; just prove to the world who you are. If you pretend to the world to be a fool, then the world will catch you and hate you. You don't want to be hated. Needless to say, I don't hate you and I shall never hate you; I shall only love you and love you."</p>
<p>Then the Master blessed his devoted disciple with all his heart's affection and love.</p>

<h2>The opportunity of youth</h2>

<p>Please never think that you will be able to get rid of wrong forces and wrong movements as the years advance upon you. It is not true. If you don't conquer a wrong force, it will remain in you unless and until you have conquered it, no matter how old you are. The only thing is that the lower vital forces that we call undivine, may not remain on the same plane of consciousness as when you were fourteen or fifteen. For an adolescent, the forces are in the physical plane, but when you are seventy or eighty, they may remain on the mental plane. But if undivine, lower vital forces are on the mental plane, do not think that they are less formidable. It is just that they are in a different plane of consciousness. If you do not conquer them on whichever plane they are, you will be their constant victim.</p>
<p>There are many rooms in the house. The thief has stolen all the things from one room and now he is in another room stealing. You can never say that just because a seeker is old, he does not have the same wrong forces that you have: insecurity, lower vital problems, jealousy and so on. Age does not conquer them. Otherwise, everyone seventy or eighty years old would be on the verge of God-realisation. Do you think old people are all better than you young people? Your wrong forces remain in your restless vital: that is why you are caught. In their case, the same forces are there, but in the mental or subtle physical. If the seekers do not consciously conquer these forces, they have to take incarnation again and again to conquer them. If you enter into their mental plane, or any plane except the physical, you will see that the same wrong forces are there. They have them, only it is as if the forces were in another room. You have them in a room in which the windows and doors are open, so everybody sees them. But they have kept their doors and windows closed.</p>
<p>These forces cannot be conquered by the passage of years. The greatest opportunity to conquer wrong forces is when you are young. When you are young, you have a determined will. This determined will is in the subtle mind and strong vital. When the vital becomes weak with age, determination goes away. Subtle mental determination is more powerful than the vital, but when the vital is weak, the physical becomes weak and the mental determination cannot work in and through the vital.</p>
<p>There are some boys and girls who are not mentally strong, but because they have a dynamic vital, they make progress. So this is the time. Now, if anything is wrong in his mind or vital he will be able to conquer it. But when he is fifty or sixty years old, he will be finished. So dear ones, you are all young. Any obstacle you see in your nature try to conquer it now, because tomorrow it will not be so easy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Failure and fear</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Failure and fear" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is a mistake after all? If we think that a mistake means something that is to be followed by punishment, then we are totally wrong. First of all, let us take it as a failure. What is failure? Failures are the pillars of success. Let us take failure as God's experience in us. God is constantly experiencing Himself in us and through us. At the same time, He is running and carrying us towards the ultimate Goal of perfect Perfection. Let us take mistakes as half truths. If we take them as something abominable and unpardonable, then they will never be rectified or shaped into truth. But if we consider mistakes as imperfect or infinitesimal truths, if we see in a mistake an iota of truth, only then can we feel that the mistake can be rectified and transformed into truth.</p>
<p>The very idea of considering a mistake as something shameful or unmentionable creates a wrong vibration. We should always identify ourselves with our largest part, with the all-covering, all-embracing part that includes the whole world, the entire humanity. At that time our so-called mistake is not a mistake. Then we feel that it is only an imperfection. It is a game of imperfection that we have played unconsciously but not deliberately. Instead, what we actually do is separate ourselves from the mistake as if it were something dirty, obscene and so ugly that we cannot touch it. With this approach we will never make progress. Instead, let us take the mistake as a lump of clay. This lump of clay can easily be shaped, moulded or beaten into a different form. Then, if we have wisdom enough, light enough, we can use that form for various purposes.</p>
<p>Instead of taking each mistake as a curse, we can take it as a blessing. First of all, we should not commit any mistakes consciously and deliberately. But if a mistake takes place in our inner nature, in our vital nature, in our physical nature, in our outer mind or physical mind, then immediately we should be ready to confess it to ourselves and to God, because confession is our immediate emancipation. Otherwise, we shall grow into a mountain of mistakes. The moment we have the courage to confess our mistake, God's adamantine Protection runs towards us. His Protection shelters us. His Protection immediately becomes our haven.</p>
<p>Why do we find it so difficult to confess our mistakes? The immediate answer is fear. What is fear? Fear is something that constantly binds us. Fear is something that constantly tells us that we are entirely different or separate from others, that our existence is only for ourselves. Fear is something that does not allow us to enter into our infinite freedom.</p>
<p>When fear enters the physical mind, we immediately cry for protection. But this physical fear is not the only kind of fear; there are other types as well. Physical fear cannot be conquered until mental fear is conquered. Mental fear cannot be conquered until psychic fear is conquered. If one has fear in the heart or in the vital, then he has to overcome this fear or transform this fear into strength with the soul's light. Otherwise, fear, which is man's worst enemy, will kill the victim like slow poison.</p>
<p>Why do we fear? We fear because we have separated ourselves from God's Love aspect. We are apt to try to approach God the Omnipotent, rather than God the all-Love. But it is not the omnipotent God who is standing with an iron rod, in our imagination, to threaten or strike us whenever we commit a mistake. Our conception of God is so peculiar. It is this wrong conception of God that is the source of our fear. We feel that if we deviate just an inch from the path of truth, then God, who is like a primary school teacher, is ready to beat us black and blue. But that kind of God is no God. There is no such God as God the tyrant. There is only one God, and this God is God the Love. This God does not punish us. He knows that it is He who is the Doer, it is He who is the Action and it is He who is the Enjoyer, both as the Action and the Doer. He is acting through each one of us, constantly shaping us in His own Way. But we feel that His only act will be to punish us for our wrong actions.</p>
<p>It is God's Dream that each individual embodies. It is God's Reality that each individual has to manifest here on earth. In each human being, God's Reality and God's Dream are looming large. God cannot be separated from His Vision and Reality. Similarly, man's existence can never be separated from God's Love. It is in God's Love aspect that He reigns supreme here on earth. Let us try to grow in God's Love and we shall see that there is no fear, no failure, no punishment, no confession necessary. In God's Love our life on earth is all joy, all achievement and all fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the easiest way to overcome imperfection in ourselves?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the easiest way to overcome imperfection in ourselves?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through full, absolute faith in the Master. You will try your best. Then, after trying, you have to surrender. But your surrender will not be <em>tamasic</em> surrender, the surrender of a lazy, idle person. You will do your utmost and you will say, "I have used the capacity that You gave me, O Lord Supreme. I am leaving the rest to You." When you think of imperfection, you should always think of the child and the mother. The child is wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, but he knows that his mother is always available to lift him up. It is a matter of a minute. If the child had to climb up by himself, he would not be able to climb. He does not have the capacity to find his soul by himself. But he knows that there is someone who is more than willing to help him. He has implicit faith in his mother. He knows how much he loves his mother and how much his mother loves him. Because his mother has claimed him as her very own and he has claimed her as his very own, on the strength of this oneness, he knows that his mother will do everything for him gladly.</p>
<p>When you think of me, you have to feel that you are of me and for me, and that I am of you and for you. Otherwise, if you want to attain perfection on your own, it will be like trying to straighten the tail of a dog for good. As long as you hold the dog's tail it is straight, but the moment you release it, it again becomes crooked. Human nature is like a dog's tail. Only when you have attained spiritual perfection will you be able to keep it straight. Otherwise, you will only hold it for five minutes; then you will become tired and release it, and it will become crooked again. Human nature is like that. But the Master can straighten it for you if you have established your oneness with him, because he loves you.</p>
<p>The child knows that he has established his oneness with the mother. He knows his source, and he runs to the source. This source has infinite capacity to transform, illumine and perfect him. The child does not maintain his own individuality or personality. His individual personality is given to his mother. He runs towards the mother and says, "Take what I have and what I am. What I am is ignorance alone, and what I have is all sand, mud and filth. I will give it up."</p>
<p>Similarly, the disciple feels that his source is the Master. Inside the Master is the Supreme. Now, it is absolutely true that it is only the Supreme in the Master and the Supreme in the seeker who can change human nature. Otherwise, it is simply impossible. But why should the Supreme do it? Why should the Master do it? It is because we have established our oneness with the Supreme in the Master. We are of him and for him, and he is in us and for us. If we establish that kind of oneness with the Master, then he will do everything for us. If we have not established that kind of oneness with him, and if he himself has not established oneness with us, then he has no obligation to purify us, and we will be under no obligation to accept him or to take his help.</p>
<p>Both the Master and the disciple need an inner bond. The Master expects aspiration from the disciple. The disciple expects liberation from the Master. But right from the beginning the disciple has to feel that what he has and what he is is nothing but descending grace. He should feel that only if he is enjoying his Master's grace, is his life meaningful. It is the divine in us, the Supreme in us, the real Reality in us, that can perfect and transform our nature. Otherwise, no matter how hard we try, we may be able to survive for ten days with the greatest difficulty. Then on the eleventh day we will again be attacked by a hostile force.</p>
<p>You have to allow the Master to hold you. I always tell about the father who stands on the edge of a pool with his eldest son and youngest son. The eldest one is holding the hand of his father, whereas the youngest one is being held by his father's hand. Then they look up and see a beautiful kite flying. The eldest brother is fascinated, and he claps his hands and loses his balance and falls into the pool. The youngest son is also thrilled, but since his father is holding his hand, he cannot let go. So the youngest son enjoys the kite, but does not fall into the pool.</p>
<p>When you allow the Master to hold you, you are safe. He is stronger than you. He will hold you so that no temptation can overcome you. But if you try to hold him, then the world of temptation may create problems and literally destroy you. So you should allow the Master to hold you. Only when the Master takes full responsibility for your life does God-realisation become possible. The disciple must always take the Master in that way. He has to feel that his Master will do everything for him, and that once his Master holds him, all his fear, doubt, anxiety, insecurity and all undivine qualities will go away. But first he has to feel that the Master is ready, more than ready, to help him out. Why will he do it? Because he has established an inner connection with the Master.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the proper role of individuality in surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the proper role of individuality in surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The disciples should have no real individuality, if by individuality we mean the fragmented individuality of the mind. But there is another individuality, which encompasses the entire universe. Christ said, "I and my Father are one." This individuality, which is universality, is welcome.</p>
<p>Although a soldier on a mission may be separated from the entire troop, he is for the troop. That is all right. As long as there is oneness with the higher reality, then individuality is fruitful of illumination and immortal love. But the individuality that you refer to is human individuality. It is separated from the reality, separated from the Source. It is like Julius Caesar's declaration, "I came, I saw, I conquered." That individuality must not remain, even in infinitesimal measure, in the disciple's consciousness. But divine individuality, which is universality, should be cultivated.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there anything we can do in order to rid ourselves of our ego?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there anything we can do in order to rid ourselves of our ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of ego. One ego says that you are an individual: you belong to a particular family, to your parents and your brothers. This ego starts in an ordinary human way, with the family. Then it goes to the village, then to the city, then to the province, then to the country. Gradually, gradually it may come to the point where you feel that you belong to the whole world. But it is a very slow, uncertain progress. It may take twenty years for you to feel that your city is your own. This ego usually comes up to the love of country, and then it stops. It has played its role. At the age of seventy or eighty you leave the body, and in your next incarnation again you start with the human ego.</p>
<p>There is another ego which in spiritual terms we shall call the divinised feeling of universal oneness. If you want to use the ordinary term on the physical plane, then you can call it ego, but actually it is the divinised feeling of oneness with the universal Consciousness. That ego will immediately tell you that you are God's child, God's son or God's daughter, so how can you say anything undivine, how can you do anything undivine? At every moment it will tell you: "Do this, don't do that." Always it will make you think and act in a divine way.</p>
<p>We are using the term ego, but the divine ego is totally different from the human ego. It is the feeling of oneness with the universal Consciousness. When the Christ said, "I and my Father are one," this was his divine ego. Now, why can we not also say this? It is just because we know what we are; therefore, we are afraid of saying it. We say, "Oh, Christ was great. We can't deny his greatness. But he was God's son." Now, you have to know that you are also God's son or God's daughter. The Christ felt this truth; he realised it. Then he said it. In your spiritual life you also have to feel, and everybody has to feel, that he is God's chosen instrument. If you feel that you are God's chosen instrument, and try to live up to that honour, then you can have no undivine ego. You have to feel it inwardly, and in your actions you have to convey it.</p>
<p>When your hand does something, your eye appreciates it. Suppose you are an artist and you have painted something most beautiful. Your eye is appreciative at that time. The eye will not say, "I didn't paint it. Let me give credit to the hand, since the hand has done it." No, the eye feels its oneness with the rest of the being, so it will say, "I have done it, so let me appreciate my capacity." The eye feels that the hand is part and parcel of the same body, although it is a totally different organ, so when the hand does something, the eye feels that the hand's achievement is its own achievement. In that way they become totally one. So when somebody else does something, if you feel that that particular person is a part of your own being, then where is the ego? The divine ego will appreciate everyone's achievements and feel that it has achieved those very things, just because of its oneness. While appreciating the beauty that the hand has created, the eye will never feel, "Oh, I couldn't do it; the hand has done it." Again, sometimes the eye does something first. The eye will see something very beautiful, let us say a flower. The eye sees it: the hand does not see it. But the next moment, the hand goes and picks the flower. The hand will not say, "The eye saw it first. I don't want to pluck it because I didn't see it first. It is beneath my dignity to pick that flower, since I did not see it first." No, the hand will just go and pick the flower. In this way, each one will play his part in the game. When the hand has done something, the eye appreciates it. The creation of the hand remains incomplete unless and until it has been appreciated by the eye. Again, when the eye sees the beauty in something, if you want to have that thing on the physical plane as your own possession, then the hand has to get it for the eye and for the entire being.</p>
<p>So, when somebody else does something, please feel that it is you who have done it. This is not wrong at all. You are not fooling yourself. You will think, "Oh, I have not done it. My name is not so-and-so." But in the universal Consciousness, where there is only one existence, and that is the infinite "I", your name is not Rabi and my name is not Chinmoy. There is only one "I", the all-pervading "I". So when I achieve something, you can easily and most legitimately claim that you have done it on the strength of your oneness with me. When you do something, I do claim it. Believe me, my disciples do accomplish many things on the physical plane, and immediately I feel that it is I who have done it. There are so many things that are done at the Centre when the boys and girls work. They do physical labour and they accomplish much. At that time I do give them credit. I appreciate them, I thank them and I offer them my gratitude. But in my inner being I feel immediately that it is I who have done it, an extended part of my consciousness. You are my spiritual children, so naturally, whatever my children have done is my achievement as well.</p>
<p>Again, on the spiritual level, when I bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above, you have every right to feel that it is with your conscious effort, your conscious aspiration, that I am able to bring it down. It is not true that you have nothing to do with it. If you can feel that when I do something, you have done it, then I will give you all the credit because you have discovered this truth. When you people do something on the physical plane, I appreciate and admire it, but actually I feel that it is an extended part of my consciousness that has done it. It is the expansion of my consciousness, the enlarged part of my being that has done it. You also should have the same feeling.</p>
<p>Always think of your enlarged existence; you are constantly expanding, expanding, expanding yourself. Like a bird, you are spreading your wings. In that way, how can there be any ego? Ego comes from separativity, from the separation of "you" and "I". But when I do something, if you yourself can claim it, this is absolutely the right approach. Feel that you have done it. When you do something and I can claim that I have done it in and through you, then where is the undivine ego?</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Sometimes I think that I am not close to you, and I feel lost. What does it mean?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is one thing to sincerely cry for me, but another thing to say that all is totally lost without me. Why should you feel lost? God is everywhere. But one thing that I cannot convince my disciples of, and I suffer so much because of it, is that I love them infinitely more than they love themselves. They do not believe it, and it seems that they will never believe it. They think that they are constantly thinking of themselves and taking care of their lives, whereas I am talking to somebody else here and there, so how can I love them more than they love themselves?</p>
<p>As long as someone feels that he has more concern, care and love for himself then I have for him, then that person cannot become really close to me inwardly, because that person is not seeing me or feeling me in a divine way. If I ask you every day whether or not you had a good breakfast, that is not an expression of divine concern. The Supreme's way of loving you, the real way of loving you, is infinitely more significant than this. Your capacity to love yourself is like one dollar. Whereas my capacity to love you is like a million dollars. Naturally, if I want to use it, I can.</p>
<p>The sun is shining for everyone, but you have to open the window to let it come in. If you open the window, the sun can enter; if you don't open it, the sun has to stay outside. Similarly, Grace is for everyone if they will only allow it to come in. Occultly and spiritually I am not limited by the body: I am everywhere. I have many powerful inner beings, and if I am not consciously doing something for you, then they are doing the needful. On the physical plane my soul's duty is to convince your mind of what I am inwardly doing. Your mind does not want to listen to your soul, it does not want to surrender to your soul. But all souls surrender to me, no matter how bad the individual disciples are.</p>
<p>At two o'clock every morning, even though my physical body may be tired, I begin feeding your souls. In one minute I am able to feed many, many souls. This one minute is different from human time. In human time, in one minute I will not be able to feed even one person. Yesterday I was speaking to a disciple on the phone and feeding his soul. At the same time, I was feeding his wife's soul. Even though she was in school, her soul was feeling it. This is because she has tremendous connection with her husband's soul.</p>
<p>When I concentrate on the disciples' souls, most of the time they come to me. But the soul need not come to me; sometimes I go to them. But when I concentrate on the Centres, I bring all the souls together. I don't go there; they just come to me. This is done in a second; not even a second it may take. I do have the capacity to do this. Thousands and millions of times I have done it.</p>

I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s from a sense of competition, but it&#039;s the thought of being exhausted. It&#039;s a baseless fear." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have run 400 metres many, many times. You know that you have run so many times and you are still alive, even though you became exhausted. The 400 metres is most difficult because it demands both stamina and speed. In most running, you need either speed or stamina. For long distance you need stamina and for short distance you need speed. But the 400 metres demands both stamina and speed. It is a most difficult race. But since you have run it many, many times, you know that you are not going to die. The difficulty in your case, is not actually fear of exhaustion, but a subtle fear that you may not be first. That creates anxiety. You do not actually worry that after 400 metres you are going to collapse and die. That fear would be absolutely baseless. But the real fear is that someone is going to beat you.</p>
<p>You have to have the feeling that even if somebody else comes in first, you will do your best. "I will do my best. Who cares what others do?" If you have that feeling, then there can be no anxiety. You have to learn the difference between anxiety and alertness. Anxiety and alertness are two different dynamic energies. When the starter is about to fire the gun, you have to be very alert. You cannot say, "If he comes in first and I come in last, no harm." No, let him do his best and you also do your best, your utmost.</p>
<p>In India I once saw a race among several men over the age of 65. Two of the runners had such stupid false modesty that when the starter fired the gun they did not start. The starter said to one of the two men, "What are you doing?" The man said, "He has not yet started, so how can I start? It is not polite." He wanted to be such a perfect gentleman that he did not want to take any advantage. Is this not stupidity? When the starter says: "Go!" at that time it is for both of them. But this fellow looked to the side and, just because his friend had not started, he said, "How can I start now?" Everybody laughed and laughed while they were running. Naturally one of them was a better runner, but he did not want to stand first. He wanted to stay with the one that was lagging behind, so they ran side by side right to the finish line. Is it not the height of stupidity?</p>
<p>We want to see your capacity. You show your capacity. Whether you are going to come in first or last is for God to decide. You cannot say that you will not show your capacity just because somebody else will not be able to run as fast as you or will be able to run faster. When you are about to run 400 metres, you should always feel that you are going to run alone. Feel that you are the only runner, and you will run at your fastest speed. Before a race do not think of others; think only of yourself. Then there can be no anxiety.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day, early in the morning, I concentrate on each of my dedicated and devoted disciples. Those who are my true disciples are fully aware of the fact, but I am sorry to say that a few of you disappoint me mercilessly with your emotional and other problems. So I ask you, for your sake, for my sake, for the Supreme's sake, please try to purify your vital world. I will become most divinely proud of each of my spiritual children. My disciples have to become very sincere, dedicated and responsible in their emotional lives as well as in their spiritual lives. I am not scolding you, but if the emotional life is not transformed, then the spiritual life, the true divine life, will only be a kind of self-deception. There can be no God-realisation.</p>
<p>Emotion itself is not bad; it is how you use emotion. Emotion has to be transformed into divine emotion. If you are using it for self-indulgence, then you will ruin your aspiration. But if you use it for your liberation and self-illumination, then emotion is your strongest power.</p>
<p>Let us use our emotion for liberation, for self-illumination. Let us fully purify our vital world. If the vital is dirty, then in the spiritual world we act like a mad elephant. A mad elephant will never reach the goal; it will only run from this side to that. I am trying my utmost to please you in your inner life, so I would be most grateful if you could try also to please me in the inner life, especially in the vital world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner life is difficult only when one wants to fulfil the outer life first and the inner life last. One has to fulfil the inner life first, or take both the inner life and the outer life together with the feeling that if the inner life is fed, then the outer life will automatically be nourished. We have to see how sincerely we have entered into the inner life. Sometimes we enter into the inner life out of temptation. As people enter into the outer life to fulfil their temptation, so also people practise the inner life for a few days or a few months. Then after they have tried, they feel that the inner life will not fulfil their temptation. The worldly life is better for that. We have to know how sincerely we have taken to the inner life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you lose something, you have to search for it in the right place. You have lost something, so try to remember where you have lost it. Have you lost it in the living room, the bedroom, the porch, or somewhere else? if you remember where you have lost it, then it will be easier for you to get it back.</p>
<p>We each have several rooms which we call the body-room, vital-room, mind-room, heart-room and soul-room. Let us say that you have lost a particular quality inside the heart-room. Since you feel you have lost something in the heart-room, please try to search for it in that particular room. You have to feel that you are searching for it at every moment. But while you are searching, do not cherish depression or a sense of loss. You have to feel that what you have lost is only misplaced, and that it is definitely there. If you feel that something has been stolen from inside the heart-room, then you will never find it. If something is stolen, how can you find it again? But if you feel that it is definitely there, that you have only misplaced it, then your search will eventually be fruitful. Today you may not find it. Tomorrow if you search for it again, again you may not find it. But the day after tomorrow you will definitely find it, as long as you know where you have misplaced it.</p>
<p>If you feel that you have misplaced your heart inside your vital, or misplaced your vital inside your hesitating mind, then again you have to go and search for them in the proper place. Sometimes you may lose your heart inside the doubting or intellectual mind. This doubting, sophisticated and intellectual mind very nicely grabs your heart and possesses it. Then you are totally devoured by the mind. If you have lost your heart in your mind, then go there and bring it back. If you have lost it in the emotional world, the lower vital world, then from there you have to bring it back. But if it is lost because you have not used it so you have forgotten where it is, then you will not find it so easily. You have to know whether you have lost it for this reason or whether some other member of your family, such as the mind or the vital, has grabbed it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Love or indifference</h2>

<p>From the beginning Mother Earth tries to nurse all her children with love. A particular child may be very indifferent. He may grab everything from Mother Earth and pay no attention to her love. Then she tries with devotion. Mother Earth constantly shows her concern and devoted qualities to her son, but the son remains absolutely indifferent. He takes everything from Mother Earth and still he remains silent. Then Mother Earth goes one step further and surrenders to his whimsical will. There is no rhyme or reason to the individual human will, but Mother Earth does not mind. Even then she wants to surrender her will to her child.</p>
<p>If her son still remains indifferent, eventually she nurses grievances. She says, "I have surrendered to you, I have given you everything, but even now you are not paying any attention to me. There is no response from you." Then she feels miserable. Everything that she could do for her son on earth, she has done. She has offered her utmost capacity. But each time she has tried to get some response from the human being, she has totally failed.</p>
<p>Finally she says, "All right, since you are such a great man, let me also play the role of indifference. I have done everything, far beyond your imagination, to please you, to make you feel that I am yours and you are mine, but you have paid no attention to me. You have been showing indifference to me. I can also do the same to you!" Then Mother Earth withdraws her affection, love and concern from that individual being. Immediately the person misses all the love, devotion and surrender he had been receiving. He misses all the divine qualities that used to give him joy. When one is no longer getting something, then one begins to value it. For example, when spiritual Masters live on earth, people mock them, or worse. Then afterwards, when the Masters leave the body, people immortalise them.</p>
<p>There comes a time when the Master has to show his divine authority. In the beginning he tries with love, devotion and surrender. But there comes a time when he has to use divine force. This is the only way he can conquer ignorance. Love is the highest force, true; but when we deal with the human mind, a so-called outer force is sometimes necessary. Love and force complete God's game.</p>
<p>In this case, indifference is the force. Mother Earth showed her love, devotion and surrender, but the indifference-force of the ungrateful human being was more powerful than the love-power that Mother Earth was offering. Then Mother Earth said, "All right, let me use the same power. If you are using a hand bomb, then I will use an atom bomb. I tried the love bomb, but it was not powerful enough. Now I will try another type of bomb."</p>
<p>When Mother Earth uses the same indifference-force, the person feels that his days are numbered. When the human being sees that Mother Earth is offering her indifference, then he comes to his senses. He touches her feet; he becomes her slave. He realises that if Mother Earth does not care for him, then he will never be able to realise God. If she withdraws, then all his divine qualities will go away from him. And if he does not use these qualities, if he does not value them and offer them to God, then Mother Earth will just show her indifference. In this way the person comes to realise that if he does not offer gratitude, if he is not pleased with what Mother Earth is doing for him, then he will be totally lost.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Most of our life, the finite life that we can see and feel, is usually surrounded by joy and suffering. Can we have a life of joy, or do we have to suffer, do we have to constantly sacrifice?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sacrifice is a very vague word. When we use this word in the human sense, we feel that we are giving away something, and in return we are getting nothing. This is the human approach. If we give our precious time, our precious money, our precious capacity, and in return we do not get anything, then we feel that we have sacrificed. But if we live in a deeper and higher consciousness, we will see that there is no such thing as sacrifice. What we call "sacrifice" is only the outer expression of our universal oneness with another human being or with the rest of the world. When we feel our universal oneness with the entire world, then there is no such thing as sacrifice.</p>
<p>Suffering has not to be accepted as something divine and necessary in order to realise God. It is not true. If suffering comes to us, then we have to accept it. True, it can play the part of purification; it can purify our mind, our vital emotions and our psychic feelings. But it is wrong to feel that by deliberately accepting suffering we will be able to realise the Highest sooner. It is not through suffering, but through spontaneous delight that we shall get that realisation. Again, we have to know the difference between earthly pleasure and divine delight or joy. Pleasure is something that we get from the senses, by satisfying the senses, whereas joy or delight springs from a deeper source within us, and permeates our entire consciousness. Pleasure is something that eventually will lead us to destruction. Delight is something that will take us eventually to our Source.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit we have two terms: <em>shreya</em> and <em>preya</em>. The first is pleasure and the second is joy or good. If we sincerely care for good, then the life of pleasure has to leave us, because there is no goodness in it. It is something that wants to negate all our spiritual discipline.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before one accepts the life of aspiration, desire is good. In the beginning a person must have desire if he is going to make any progress at all. His desires will give him some dynamism. If he does not have any desires or any aspiration, then he will not budge an inch. He will be like a solid stone, making no progress at all. If he has desires, eventually he will find that there is no end to his desires, and no abiding satisfaction or fulfilment in them. Then he will try the world of aspiration. In the world of aspiration he will see that peace, light, bliss, power and all the divine qualities are ready to satisfy him both in his inner life and in his outer life.</p>
<p>In the outer life when we go through desire, it destroys us. We have to free ourselves from the fetters of ignorance. How? Through aspiration. When we have aspiration, we can free ourselves from bondage. When we feel this supreme necessity, then automatically desire begins to give place to aspiration. But when we think of giving up desire, we have to be careful not to misunderstand the concept of renunciation. What are we going to renounce? Not a person, not the world, but that which is disturbing us and not allowing us to grow into light and perfection. That thing is ignorance. We have to renounce ignorance, not our so-called desires. Outer desire is just a product of our ignorance. If we can put an end to ignorance, then we shall see that desire does not exist in us any more. At that time Peace, Light and Bliss from above will shower down on us.</p>
