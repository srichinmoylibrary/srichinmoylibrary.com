<h2>Question: How is it possible for one human being to really love another human being?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite easy for one human being to love another human being if he sees the Divine in the other person. It is always advisable to go to the root, which is God. If we want to love someone, the best thing is for us to love the One who is all Love. If we know how to love Him in Himself then it becomes extremely easy for us to love Him in a human being.</p>
<p>Let us take the human being as the mind-room and God as the heart-room. The heart-room has love, real love, whereas the mind-room has very limited love and light right now. The mind-room is human love and the heart-room is divine love, let us say. If we enter into the mind-room, which is dark, and from there go to the illumined room, then the dark room will always remain as it was. But if we go from the heart-room, which is flooded with light, into the mind-room, then the mind-room can be illumined by the light from the heart-room. We have to go first into the room that has light and then bring that light into the room which is not illumined.</p>
<p>If first we love God, who is the heart-room, then it is possible for us to really love and illumine human beings. If we go to God first and get Love from Him, with that Love we will easily be able to love a human being. Ordinary human love will eventually lead to frustration, whereas divine love will lead to satisfaction and illumination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to cry inwardly. Here in the ordinary world, if a child cries for a piece of candy, his parents will give it to him. Similarly, if we cry inwardly and soulfully for Peace. Light and Bliss, then the one who has it, God, will give it to us. When a human child cries for something, his human parents are in a position to supply him with it. In the case of a seeker, God is the Parent. He is divine and immortal and He has everything in infinite measure. When we cry for something with a real inner need, if our cry is sincere and genuine, naturally He will give it to us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you work in your office and get your salary, you put this money inside your pocket. Then you utilise it whenever necessity demands. Early in the morning when you pray and meditate, please feel that you are earning a salary, which is Peace, Light and Bliss. This Peace, Light and Bliss you keep inside your pocket, which is your heart. Then, when you enter into the hustle and bustle of life, when you go to the office or mix with your friends who are not at all spiritual, when the undivine atmosphere is trying to pull you down, then you can enter into your heart and find abundant Peace, Light and Bliss there.</p>
<p>It is not enough just to cry during meditation; when our meditation is over, our life must be an expression of that inner cry. If during meditation we love the world but hate it as soon as our meditation is over, then that is not good meditation. Our meditation must follow us when we enter into the hustle and bustle of life and inspire us to offer our capacity. Our outer life should be an expression of our inner life. In our meditation we realise and in our dedication we manifest. When we meditate, we try to realise the Truth, and when we dedicate ourselves and work in the world, we try to manifest the realisation which we achieved during our meditation.</p>

He is doing the wrong thing by striking me. Why should I allow him to throw his ignorance at me by striking me? On the contrary, I will try my utmost to prevent him from increasing his own ignorance.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, provided I knew that the one being struck was innocent. Innocent people should always be protected. We have to know the difference between sincerity and stupidity. Spiritual people should not be stupid; they should only be sincere. If they have not attacked someone, then it is their bounden duty to keep themselves free from attack. And if someone else is being attacked they should try to help if they can.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! The real spiritual life does not exclude humanity. To follow a spiritual path does not mean you have to go into the Himalayan caves to meditate. Inside each human being, inside each member. of our family, you shall try to discover God. When an aspirant follows a spiritual path, he should feel that each human being is an instrument of God. We are all instruments of God, but those who are practising meditation and spiritual disciplines, those who have accepted the spiritual life, are becoming conscious instruments of God. If you become a conscious instrument of God and you see that your own husband and wife or children are unconscious, what do you do? You do not exclude them from your life; you try to bring to the fore the conscious part, the divine part in them so that they also can become conscious instruments of God.</p>
<p>In the real spiritual life you do not exclude the family. On the contrary, you try to awaken the members of the family who are fast asleep. Unless and until they are also awakened and running toward the same Goal, you will not be fully satisfied. Suppose you have a most delicious meal in front of you and you are in a position to eat, but the members of your family are not in a position to eat. Your sympathetic heart will not be satisfied unless and until they are in a position to share with you. In the spiritual life always we want to share with others our divine experiences, our divine achievements, so we always try to show others the way. But how do we do this? We do it by prayer. We pray to the Inner Pilot who has awakened us to also awaken the members of our family. But if it is not His Will to awaken them at this moment, then we must run along the inner path without them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see social injustice the best thing is to go deep within and ask the Inner Pilot if and how you should deal with the problem. You have to dive deep within and get the inner message about how to deal with that particular case. Otherwise, on the spur of the moment, your emotional vital or your intellectual mind may come to the fore and give you the wrong message, The really right thing you will know only when you have a free access to your soul. If your soul offers you the message, then you can take immediate action.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is not the only way. Two things are of paramount importance: prayer and meditation. Both come from aspiration and it is up to the individual to choose. If prayer comes to him quickly or prayer is more convincing than meditation for him, then he can reach God through his sincere prayer. But if somebody feels that meditation is more helpful, then he can reach God through his soulful meditation. Prayer and meditation — there is no other method! Either prayer or meditation or both are necessary to reach God.</p>

<h2>Question: What is the spiritual conception of responsibility and how does it differ from the human conception?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, our human conception of responsibility is founded upon an incorrect belief. Every person feels that he has far too much responsibility. We feel bound, limited, tied hand and foot to other people. But when we go deep within we come to realise that God is responsible for you, for me, for everybody. Every day He is fulfilling all His responsibilities in infinite ways, yet God is not bound by anything. Responsibility is not something that binds. The more we are conscious of our responsibilities as divine opportunities, the more we can expand our consciousness. If we live in the human consciousness, responsibility is bondage: But in the spiritual life responsibility is the expansion of our wisdom-light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Necessity is one thing and attachment is another. Food is a necessity in our life right now. If we don’t eat, we will die. If we want to become a voracious eater, we can; but whatever we eat beyond what we need is attachment and not necessity.</p>
<p>When we pray and meditate, we come to realise what is really essential in our life. Those things alone we strive to have. Non-essentials and things that are detrimental to us we try to avoid. By drinking too much or by eating too much we cannot approach reality. If our emotional life or vital life or aspects of our physical life are detrimental to our health, we will try to conquer them. Things that are necessary or helpful in our daily life we shall always accept wholeheartedly. But in the ordinary life there are many things which we do not really need. They are all accessories. We find it difficult to give them up because of our long association with ignorance. We feel that these things <em>do</em> help us; we have come to feel that we need them. But this is not true. There are many things that we are attached to that can easily be rejected from our day-to-day life provided we care for a higher, deeper and more fulfilling life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there some technique to arrive at the divine consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there some technique to arrive at the divine consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to attain a divine consciousness, we try to discipline our life. Our life needs constant discipline. Our life-energy must flow toward the Source. If we want to reach a divine consciousness, we must pray or meditate regularly; we must try to consecrate our life to our Inner Pilot. If we consciously consecrate our day-to-day life to God, then automatically we will arrive at the divine consciousness.</p>
<p>Right now the consciousness that we are utilising is the earth-bound consciousness: the consciousness of ‘I,’ ‘my’ and ‘mine’. This is how we start our journey. For a baby, his parents are the whole world. Then he grows up a little and learns about his neighbourhood and that becomes his whole world. Gradually he learns about his city, his country and so on. Eventually, if he becomes a man of learning and tries to acquire an international outlook, he feels that the whole world is his home. In the spiritual life also, we start with limited consciousness. When the limited consciousness expands, it gradually grows into divine consciousness.</p>
<p>If we want to arrive at the divine consciousness, or if we want to have access to the divine consciousness, which is constantly expanding, then we have to discipline our everyday life, and we have to dedicate our life to a higher cause: to the Divine within us. Then automatically we will discover the divine consciousness, which is already hidden within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very often we see that the mind wants to do one thing and the body, or physical consciousness, wants to do something else. The mind is inside the body; but right now it wants to watch a movie, whereas the body is tired and wants to sleep. The mind is inside the body, but the body has its own consciousness, which wants to assert itself, and the mind has its own consciousness. The mind and the body can walk together. If the body wants to listen to the dictates of the mind, it <em>can</em> listen. Again, the body can revolt. Very often the body listens to the mind, but sometimes it does not. So we can say that they are one when they agree to go together and they are two when they disagree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Western society is more than ready. The West is running fast, very fast, toward the goal. It is ready because it feels the necessity of the highest Truth. I am an Indian; I have come from the mystical East. But here in the West I have seen many, many seekers who can easily be placed on the same footing with Eastern seekers of the highest magnitude. There are many seekers in the West who are extremely sincere and dedicated, who have intense aspiration to arrive at the highest Goal. Those who feel the necessity of a higher life are more than ready. Those who don’t feel the necessity — whether they are Easterners or Westerners — are not ready for any spiritual path.</p>
