<p>These stories are not my stories. They have been told and retold by countless people, and God alone knows who the first authors were. Each person tells these stories with his own colouring, in a slightly different way. Most of the stories involve the great Mogul Emperor Akbar and his minister and court jester, Birbal; or King Krishna Chandra and his minister and court jester, Gopal Bhanr.</p>
<p>I do hope that my Spiritual Comments will inspire sincere seekers of the eternal Truth to lead a better, higher and more inspiring life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Foolish And The Wise</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Foolish And The Wise" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar once asked his minister, “Birbal, tell me, who are the wise people on earth and who are the fools?”</p>
<p>Birbal replied, “Your Majesty, the wise people are those who perform their duties and do not leave anything incomplete. Once they have undertaken something they complete it. The fools are those who never fulfil their duties.”</p>
<p>“Why are these people fools?”</p>
<p>“They are fools because they have to come back to earth again and again. If they do not complete their work in this incarnation, they will have to do it in their next incarnation. They are fools to come back to this earth again in order to finish the work that they could have done in one incarnation.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, the wise are those who want to complete their first and foremost task in this incarnation. Their only work, their main duty, is to realise God. The beginning of their work is aspiration; the end of their work is realisation. Wise people know that there are many things to do. They know that if they don’t start working they will never be able to accomplish what they want to accomplish, so they start right away before they lose either the inclination or the capacity to do the work.</p>
<p>The wise do three things correctly. First they cry for God. Then they become one with God. And finally they work for God. But the fools do not cry for God. They do not care to become one with God. And they do not want to fulfil God. This is the difference between a fool and a wise man. The fools have the capacity to do this work, but they do not utilise it. Unless they utilise their capacity, unless they accomplish their duty, which is God-realisation, they will never be satisfied. So the fools have to start working like the wise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Darkness Of The Mind</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Darkness Of The Mind" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar said to his minister, “Birbal, for a long time I have been thinking of one question. I am sure you will be able to answer it. We see everything clearly in the sunlight, but is there anything that cannot be seen even with the help of sunlight?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your Majesty, there is something that cannot be seen in the sunlight. Even the sunlight fails to illumine it.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Birbal?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, it is the darkness of the mind.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Birbal’s answer is absolutely correct. The only question that Birbal might not have been in a position to answer is whether there is anything that can show us the ignorance of the mind and illumine it. Even if he had been able to answer this question, he still would not have been able to actually illumine the darkness of anybody’s mind.</p>
<p>How do we illumine the mind? We illumine the dark, unlit, obscure, impure mind by bringing to the fore our inner sun. The outer sun can show us only earthly objects, but the inner sun can show us what the mind is, how it operates and what it contains. We bring the inner sun to the fore by digging deep within. When we dig very deep into the ground we reach water. Similarly, when we dig very deep into ourselves, we reach our inner sun. At this point I must say that there is not only one inner sun, but many. How many we bring to the fore depends on how we dig and how deep we dig. If we dig deep within most soulfully, in the way the Supreme wants us to dig, then we discover many inner suns. And we can easily bring them to the fore.</p>
<p>Yet, when we have brought our inner suns to the fore, our role is not over. First we illumine our own inner and outer existence, and then we try to illumine the world around us: our friends, our relatives, our dear ones. And finally we try to illumine the entire world. But first we have to dig deep within in order to get in touch with our own inner suns.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Power To Punish</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Power To Punish" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Akbar asked his ministers, “Tell me, who is superior, God or I?”</p>
<p>The ministers were all amused by this question. Outwardly they acted very serious and made the Emperor feel that he had asked a most significant and difficult question, but inwardly they were all laughing at Akbar for being foolish enough to try to compare himself with God.</p>
<p>At last Birbal came forward and said, “I can answer this question. Undoubtedly you are far superior to God.”</p>
<p>Akbar was outwardly amused, but inwardly he was deeply pleased. He challenged Birbal, “Prove that I am superior to God.”</p>
<p>Birbal said, “Your Majesty, when somebody commits a very serious crime you have the power to punish him. You have the power to place him in a prison cell for the rest of his life. But poor God! He created everything and the whole creation belongs to Him, yet He does not have the power to give a lifelong sentence to anybody. His Power of Compassion is infinitely more powerful than His Power of Justice. He cannot punish anybody the way you do. So you are far superior to God, because you have the power to punish severely.”</p>
<p>Akbar was satisfied and pleased with this answer, but the ministers were all amused.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>When a disciple of a spiritual Master makes a serious mistake, the punishment he gets from the Master is next to nothing. The Master becomes totally one with the disciple’s mistake, with the disciple’s imperfection. Like God, he has a big heart, and he takes his disciple’s mistake as his own imperfection. So he cannot punish his spiritual child. But the other disciples want him to receive extremely severe punishment. At any moment they may make the same serious mistake themselves, yet they are ready to punish their spiritual brother most severely. They feel that they are superior to the person who has made the mistake, and for this reason they think that they have every right to punish him. But in fact, these disciples are superior only in the matter of showing their ego-power or the power of their judgement against the accused. Since the Master is all love and compassion, his judgement is different. His judgement is forgiveness. His judgement is identification with the one who has made the mistake so that he does not make that mistake again. The judgement of equals is condemnation and punishment. But the judgement of one who is really superior is identification and illumination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Universal Jealousy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Universal Jealousy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar asked Birbal, “How is it that there is no hair on my palm? There is hair everywhere else on my body. How is it that there is none on the palm of my hand?”</p>
<p>Birbal answered, “It is because you always have plenty of money in your hands, and you give it away in charity. Your palms are being rubbed constantly, so the hair there has all been rubbed away.”</p>
<p>“But how is it that you do not have hair on your palms, either?”</p>
<p>“Just because I constantly receive money from you, my palms are always being rubbed. You are constantly giving me money and I am constantly receiving it, and that is why we have no hair on our palms.”</p>
<p>“But what about those who do not get money from me the way you do? Why don’t they have hair on their palms?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is because they are very jealous. Jealous people are always thinking of the money that you are giving me and that I am receiving from you. They constantly rub their hands together in anticipation of receiving some money. They are always burning with jealousy and greed, and so they just rub and rub their palms together. That is why they do not have any hair on their palms either.”</p>
<p>Akbar was highly amused and pleased; but those who were listening to Birbal were terribly embarrassed at his accusation, and they bowed their heads in shame.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>When I give something to a disciple my love-power increases, and when that person receives devotedly from me his gratitude-power increases. Whatever I give goes to the disciple in the form of love; and while receiving, what he offers in return comes to me in the form of gratitude. But if those who do not get something at that time become jealous, they simply delay their own progress. When I am giving spiritual wealth to a particular disciple, the others can easily feel that it is they who are giving. And while the disciple is receiving from me, they can feel that it is they who are receiving this wealth. If they can identify themselves with my offering and, at the same time, with the devoted qualities of the receiver, then they become the giver as well as the receiver.</p>
<p>Identification is not illusion. Identification is not deception. In the spiritual life one must always try to identify himself with the Truth that is coming from above and trying to manifest itself here on earth. Identification with Light and Truth is the only important thing in life. When a disciple identifies himself with his Master’s consciousness, he becomes one with the Creator. And when he identifies himself with his fellow disciples, he becomes one with the creation. When he becomes inseparably one with both the Creator and the creation, he gets the utmost joy.</p>
<p>By being jealous of what the giver has or of what the receiver gets, one can never have joy or peace of mind. In order to be constantly happy, one has to identify himself with Reality’s Source and Reality’s Course, with Reality’s Glow and Reality’s Flow. Reality’s Source is the Master; Reality’s Course is the disciple. Reality’s Glow is the Master; Reality’s Flow is the disciple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Heaven And Hell</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Heaven And Hell" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar once asked Birbal, “After death, who are the people that go to Heaven and who are the people that go to hell?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” replied the minister, “only clever people go to Heaven after death. The fools go to hell.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” asked the Emperor. “Why do the clever people go to Heaven? How do they become clever?”</p>
<p>“They become clever by knowing that there is only one thing worth having, and that is love. When they give love to the world and receive love from the world in return, everything is done. Only those who love the world and get love from the world are clever, and they go to Heaven. Those who don’t love the world and do not get love from the world go to hell.”</p>
<p>The Emperor was silent.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Birbal’s answer is almost perfect. His only mistake is to say “clever” when what he really means is “wise.” Now we have to know whether we love the world for its own sake, or whether we love God inside the world. If we feel that the Creator and the creation are one, then by loving the Creator of the world we can love His creation as well. Otherwise, we will love the world and expect love from the world in return. And if we do not get love from the world, we will feel sad and miserable.</p>
<p>According to spiritual philosophy, only those who love God in mankind and do not expect anything in return go to the real Heaven. Only those who offer love constantly and unconditionally to God in man can go to the highest abode of Peace, Light and Bliss after death. Those who do not do that will naturally go to an inferior world where these divine qualities are found in less sufficient measure.</p>
<p>But again, where is Heaven? Heaven is not just a place where we go after death. We go to Heaven and hell every day. Heaven and hell are states of consciousness. In the perfection of the mind, in the peace of the mind, Heaven abides. In the frustration of the mind, in the depression of the mind, hell lives. Every day we experience Heaven and hell in our lives. Frustration, depression, insecurity, worry, doubt, fear, anxiety and jealousy all make us live in hell. Security, beauty, joy, peace, light and love all allow us to dwell in Heaven at every moment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Akbar Is Superior To Indra</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Akbar Is Superior To Indra" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Akbar asked his ministers and the others present in his court, “Tell me frankly, who is superior: Indra, the Lord of the Gods, or I? Be very frank.”</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked, and nobody dared to answer. If they said that Indra was superior to Akbar, Akbar would be displeased. And if they said that Akbar was superior to Indra, it would be a real lie. So they all kept silent.</p>
<p>But finally Birbal came forward and said, “I have the answer.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me,” said Akbar.</p>
<p>Birbal proclaimed, “You are superior.”</p>
<p>Akbar was outwardly amused and inwardly pleased. “Prove it,” he said.</p>
<p>“That is very easy,” replied Birbal. “When the Creator created you and Indra, He put both of you on a scale. On one side He placed you, and on the other side He placed Indra. Just because you were heavier than Indra, you dropped down to earth and Indra remained up in Heaven. So you see, you are superior because you are heavier. You are more fulfilling for earth. That is why you have become the Emperor of the earth.”</p>
<p>Akbar was very happy. He thought, “Indra remains high because he is light. I came down because of my superior weight. That is why I remain on earth.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Everybody was happy with this answer. But poor Akbar did not get the point. He did not understand that Birbal really meant that Indra was superior. Akbar thought that just because he was heavier in weight he had more power.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, a seeker sits on the scale every day. God places him on one side of the scale and his ignorance on the other side. The seeker always finds that his ignorance is heavier, much heavier than his knowledge and wisdom. Then he feels miserable. So he tries to pray, he tries to meditate, and gradually he increases his knowledge and inner wisdom. Simultaneously the other side of the scale, his ignorance, becomes lighter and lighter.</p>
<p>Finally a day comes when he has only knowledge. His ignorance has all been devoured or illumined by his inner knowledge. When there is nothing on the other side of the scale, the knowledge side drops down to earth again and the seeker enters into the world to work for mankind with his newly acquired wisdom. With this wisdom-power he tries to conquer the ignorance of the world.</p>

<p>There were once two brothers. Their father had recently died and left his property and money to them. But the brothers were always in the habit of quarrelling and fighting. When their father was alive he could not bring about peace between his two sons. Now, after his death, their quarrelling increased tenfold.</p>
<p>The two brothers had to share their property and divide their money, but they simply could not come to terms. Each one thought that he rightly deserved more than the other, and they could not agree to have equal shares. Each one felt that his father had more love and more concern for him than for the other one, and there was no peace between them.</p>
<p>Finally they decided to take their inheritance to an old aunt who lived in a distant town and let her keep it for them until they could come to some agreement. They went to this elderly woman and said, “Please, Aunt, you keep the money. We cannot come to any agreement about sharing it. After a year or two, when we become real friends, real brothers, we will come back for it. But only when both of us come together will you give us the money. If only one comes, you must keep it until he brings the other.” Their aunt said, “Yes, my sons, I will keep your money. Your father is dead. Now you should live in peace. I will never take a cent of your money. When you come back as friends, I will give it to you with utmost joy.”</p>
<p>After five or six months, the younger brother, who was a great rogue, came all alone to this old lady, crying and sobbing. He said that his brother had died in an accident near their home. The younger brother struck his chest and reproached himself bitterly, saying that he and his brother still had not become friends when the accident happened. “I have lost my brother,” he wept. ‘'Please give me the inheritance now, for I have gone into debt in order to give him a most elaborate funeral. Now he is gone. I have lost forever a divine opportunity. Now my whole family is gone. I have no one; I have nothing.” And he went on crying and crying for his lost brother.</p>
<p>He so completely convinced the old lady that she began shedding tears of compassion for his sorrow. She showered him with motherly affection and concern and gave him all the money that his father had left them.</p>
<p>Then the younger brother brought the money to the little house in the village where he and his brother both lived, and in a few days he started building a very large new house. The elder brother wondered where he had got the money to build such a big house. “Perhaps he has gone to our aunt and somehow brought back some of the money,” he thought. So without telling the younger one, he set out for her village.</p>
<p>When his aunt saw him, at first she thought she was seeing a ghost. But when he spoke to her, asking if his brother had come for the money, she knew that she had been deceived. Still, she had to answer yes to his question.</p>
<p>The elder brother became furious. “Did we not tell you that we had to come together in order to get the money?” he shouted. “We told you that you were not to give up the money if one of us came alone.”</p>
<p>“That is true,” she said, “but if somebody dies, can he come from Heaven to collect money from me? Your brother convinced me that you had died in an accident far away in your own village. How could I have known that you had not died?”</p>
<p>The elder brother started abusing the lady for her credulity. Then he demanded his full share. “You have to give me at least one half of what my father left us. Otherwise I shall sue you,” he threatened.</p>
<p>The old lady replied, ‘'I did you a favour by accepting the money, and your brother came and deceived me. Now what money do I have left to give you?”</p>
<p>In a rage, he began insulting and cursing the poor woman. When a neighbour heard him screaming and shouting, he came to find out what was going on. When he had heard the whole story he said, “She is an innocent lady. You asked for her help, and she did her best for both of you. Since you made the rule that she could give you money only when both brothers came together, then I wish to ask you what you are doing here alone. Go away. Don’t bother this innocent woman. When you and your brother come together, everything can be settled.”</p>
<p>In this way, the neighbour chased away the second brother for being so unkind to his aunt.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>What do we learn from this? In the spiritual world if we deceive a sincere person, there will be some cosmic power to come to his rescue. The innocent will eventually be protected by a divine force. In this case the younger brother was the real culprit. The older brother was scolding and insulting his aunt, who was innocent. If he wanted to scold, he should have scolded his younger brother.</p>
<p>You will say that the real culprit has escaped completely. But no, he has not escaped. He has only to wait for the law of karma. At the end of the year, or sometime in the future, he will become blind or lame, or he will suffer in some other way. Right now the real culprit is building a big house. When the building is completed, one day you will see that the architect did not design the ceiling properly. While the younger brother is inside, the ceiling will fall and he will be killed, and his money will go to his elder brother, who was largely innocent.</p>
<p>But the most innocent one of all was their aunt, who wanted to help them, and who was being insulted and scolded for her help. So the Divine Grace automatically came in the form of the neighbour to protect her. The second brother was innocent in the matter of the money, but guilty in scolding and insulting his aunt. His bad karma came to him immediately, for he was chased away by the neighbour, and he got no money. His good karma will come sometime in the future.</p>
<p>In this world, if we deceive someone, either today or tomorrow the cosmic forces are bound to recoil on us and punish us. This moment we may escape, but the next moment we will be caught. It is like destroying oneself.</p>
<p>When I do something wrong to you, I am destroying myself also because you are part of my larger existence. When I deceive you in some way, I am deceiving myself. I have a house. You are one wall, he is another wall, somebody else is a third wall. When, out of jealousy or greed or any other undivine quality, I try to destroy you or create problems for you, that means I am breaking one wall of my house. And then what will happen? When this wall is gone and there is a storm or a heavy wind, the other walls will also fall. But if I keep all the walls in proper condition, the whole building remains safe and perfect.</p>
<p>The cosmic forces will never allow us to cheat anybody. Today or tomorrow we shall be punished. But again, when we do something right or good and help someone in any way, then these cosmic forces will reward us. They will take us closer to our Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">No Alternative, The King Had To Laugh</h2><span property="dc:title" content="No Alternative, The King Had To Laugh" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>King Krishna Chandra had a favourite minister who always used to amuse everybody. He would make everybody laugh and laugh and laugh. When the King had worked very hard and needed some mental relaxation, he used to invite this particular minister, Gopal, to give him some amusement.</p>
<p>One day the King said to himself, “I will not allow Gopal to make me laugh today. I will remain silent, serious and grave. Let me see if he can make me laugh.”</p>
<p>Gopal had always been successful at making the King laugh, but on that particular day the King wanted to remain serious. He told Gopal, “If you cannot make me laugh today, then in the evening you will be put to death.”</p>
<p>Gopal tried in every way to make the King laugh, but he could not. He tried everything he could think of, but he failed repeatedly.</p>
<p>Evening was fast approaching, and still Gopal had not provoked so much as a smile from the King. Finally he said, “You rascal! I am going to die at any moment, and you can’t even smile. You think my entire life is not worth one of your stupid smiles. It takes only a second for you to give me a smile. I have children, I have family, I have many obligations here on earth. Everybody will come and cry for me when I have to leave this beautiful earth, and you can’t give me a smile! Which is more important, your smile or my precious life, when I have so many who depend on me? You are a rascal!”</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked and stunned at his audacity. They thought, “Now he will really die! Is this the time to insult the King?” But the King could not restrain his laughter at hearing himself called a rascal by his minister. The King had to laugh, so he lost the game.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>In all our Centres I see that some of you are sad, bitter and depressed for long periods of time. In most of the Centres you don’t see me often on the physical plane, but from the inner planes I try to chase away your depression. In so many ways I try and try with my force to give you Light and Joy. In New York, I see the disciples most of the time with my human eyes, and I tell them, “Don’t be depressed! Don’t be depressed!” I pour and pour and pour Compassion. I show them boundless Concern and Love. But nothing works, nothing works; I cannot make them smile.</p>
<p>Then the time comes for me to threaten. I tell someone, “In twenty-four hours’ time I will throw you out of the Centre. I will throw you out of the Centre if I see you depressed tomorrow.” And this is a serious threat; it is not a mere joke. Even if somebody has stayed with me for four or five years, I don’t care. When I say I will throw him out of the Centre tomorrow, I mean it, and he feels that I am serious. The next day he comes, he smiles, he mixes with people, he does everything very cheerfully. When my Love fails, when my Compassion fails, when everything else fails, then my divine Authority succeeds. When I use my scolding power, it is my divine Authority that is operating. Light comes through my divine Authority and begins to operate inside the disciple who is sad and depressed and harbouring negative forces.</p>
<p>Is it right for me to scold people? No! But it is necessary, and necessity knows no law. When the minister’s life was at stake, he scolded and insulted the King to make him laugh. In my case also I see that this works. In his case it was his own life that was about to come to an end. But in my case it is not my life; it is the spiritual life of the depressed disciple which is in danger, because when a disciple is continually depressed, his spiritual progress ends.</p>
<p>So it is for your own good that I take the very serious step of threatening to throw you out of the Centre. It is for your own progress and improvement that I take this bold step. You will be shocked when I threaten you in this way because you do value God and the spiritual life. My only concern is to make you happy, for when you are happy you make fast progress. If I can make my disciples progress faster, I will do so by any means. This is why I scold my disciples from time to time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Divine Business Proposition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Divine Business Proposition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It was a very hot summer day and, on his way home from the palace, Gopal became tired. So he entered into a garden, took off his coat and lay down to sleep. While he was fast asleep a thief came and stole his coat.</p>
<p>When he woke up and saw that his coat had been stolen, Gopal became very sad. He said to himself, “Now what am I going to do? How am I going to return home? What will I say to my wife? This was my most beautiful coat.”</p>
<p>Gopal prayed to the Supreme Goddess, “O Mother, if You bless me with ten rupees on my way home, I will use half the amount to buy a coat and the other half I will give as a love offering at Your Temple.”</p>
<p>The Goddess kindly listened to Gopal’s prayer, and on his way home he found a five-rupee note. Although he had promised the Goddess half of what he found, Gopal was very clever. He said, “O Goddess, I asked You for ten rupees and promised to give You five. Now I see that You have already kept Your share. Since You have kept Your share, I don’t have to give anything to the Temple. With the five rupees that are my share I shall buy myself a beautiful new coat. I am most grateful that You have given me the money to buy a coat.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Some seekers come to a spiritual Master and say, “Master, give us Peace, Light and Bliss. We shall share it with others. We shall give half of the Peace, Light and Bliss we get from you to others.” But when the Master gives them Peace, Light and Bliss, they feel that he has not given them enough. So immediately they say, “Master, you are very clever. You have not given us the full amount. You have given us only half of what we expected from you. Naturally you cannot expect us to share this little bit that we have with others. We shall keep it for ourselves until we have enough to share. But we are grateful to you for giving us this much.”</p>
<p>But there are some seekers who are very sincere. They feel that even if they get an insignificant quantity of inner wealth, they can still share it with the world without losing anything. They feel that if they give a little of their Peace, Light and Bliss to the world, the Master will give them a hundredfold in return. This feeling of theirs is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Again, there are some seekers who feel that only by giving to others can they manifest the Divine on earth. These seekers never expect anything either from the world or from the Master. Whatever they get from the Master they give unconditionally and unreservedly to the world at large. Even if the Master or the world does not give them anything in return, they will remain happy and satisfied. They feel that offering their wealth gives them the highest and deepest joy. The disciples who give unconditionally without expecting anything from the world or from the Master, those who cry for the manifestation of the Supreme’s Light on earth, are the true chosen disciples of the Master. The Master is most proud of them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Eye Specialist</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Eye Specialist" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day while Gopal was walking along the street he saw a terrible battle going on in front of the office of an eye specialist. The eye specialist and a patient were arguing and shouting and striking each other. Gopal rushed to the spot and enquired what was going on.</p>
<p>The customer said, “Look at this fool! Look at this rogue! Just a few minutes ago I was walking along the street and I heard a man saying, ‘O Miracle-power! O Wonder of Wonders! I am cured of my affliction! I was blind for so many years. Then I came to this eye specialist, and now I can see everything! I can read even the tiniest letters!’ So since my eyesight is quite poor and I find it impossible to read, I thought I would get a new pair of glasses that would enable me to read everything. But this rogue is giving me glasses that don’t allow me to read anything!”</p>
<p>With mounting irritation the doctor replied, “What can I do? I have tried all the glasses I have, but none of them work for you. Nothing is suitable for you, so I am helpless.”</p>
<p>But the customer was not satisfied, and the argument went on. Finally the eye specialist shouted, “Get away from here! Don’t waste my time. I have many more patients to take care of.”</p>
<p>The customer refused to go away, however. He insisted, “No, you have to give me glasses so that I can read. I am ready to pay for them.”</p>
<p>Then Gopal interrupted and asked the customer, “First tell me, did you ever go to school? Did you ever study the alphabet? Did you ever learn to read?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, I didn’t go to school,” replied the customer. “I never studied anything. I didn’t learn how to read or write. That is why I want to get glasses from this doctor, but he refuses to help me.”</p>
<p>“You don’t even know the alphabet and you think that wearing glasses will now teach you how to read? You fool! Wearing glasses will not teach you how to read,” cried Gopal. “And you!” he continued, turning to the doctor. “How is it that while you were offering him one pair of glasses after another, you never asked him whether he knew how to read?”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, you have to start with something. If you have a little aspiration, then the Master can increase it by bringing down Peace, Light and Bliss for you. If you have a little eagerness for spirituality, only then can the Master increase your eagerness in infinite measure. But if someone has no aspiration, what can the Master do? If one has absolutely nothing, then he is a hopeless case. Even the Master is helpless and useless at that time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mockery Returns Home</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mockery Returns Home" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The minister once went to visit a muslim friend of his. The Muslim was eating when he went in, and just for fun, the minister asked him, “Khajee?” That is a respectful Muslim term meaning “what are you eating?”</p>
<p>The Muslim said, “I am eating rice, and I am eating your second Avatar.”</p>
<p>According to Hindu tradition, the second Avatar was the Lord in the form of a fish. So instead of saying, “I am eating fish,” the Muslim said, “I am eating your second Avatar,” in order to insult the minister, who was a Hindu.</p>
<p>The minister, who was not to be defeated, immediately replied, “Oh, do you think it is our second Avatar? No, you are wrong. I see clearly that you are eating our third Avatar.”</p>
<p>Now the third Avatar was the Lord in the form of a boar, and Muslims never eat the meat of the boar.</p>
<p>The Muslim exclaimed, “No, no, no! I don’t eat it! I don’t eat it!” He was so disgusted at the very idea, that he threw all his food away. He shouted, “You have insulted me!”</p>
<p>The minister replied, “You have insulted me. You told me that you were eating our second Avatar, so I told you that you were eating our third Avatar.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>What do we learn from this story? We learn that when we criticise or mock any religion, consciously or unconsciously, immediately God will inspire the followers of that religion to make fun of our stupidity. God wants us to see and feel His living Presence in all religions. One man was a Muslim, and the other was a Hindu. Followers of these two religions are always at daggers drawn. When the Muslim attacked the Hindu, the Hindu immediately retaliated. No matter what the situation, if you attack someone unnecessarily, at that time the divine Power will take his side and challenge you.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life we always see that if we just want to find fault with somebody else, if we want to criticise and make fun of someone, God will immediately give him the capacity to make fun of us. If the Muslim had said the right thing, then the question of making fun, the question of insulting and abusing, might not have arisen. If he had said, “rice and fish,” then who knows what the minister would have said. But instead, the Muslim had to make fun of Hinduism by saying, “I am eating your second Avatar.” That is why the minister gave him a reply which made him lose his appetite.</p>
<p>You have to be very careful in this world. When you make fun of people, they will pay you back in your own coin. Attack them and immediately you will be attacked. Like a tennis ball thrown against a wall, your attack will bounce off and come back at you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Miser</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Miser" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a very, very rich man, but you cannot imagine how miserly he was. He had hundreds of thousands of rupees, but for him to spend one rupee was extremely difficult. Although he did not have the capacity to be content, he thought that if he got married, his wife would have to get at least a little of his money. He therefore remained a bachelor all his life, since he did not want to share his money with anyone.</p>
<p>This poor rich miser had no friends and no relatives. He had only a servant to do his cleaning and cooking while he carried on the business of amassing a fortune. This apparent luxury was an unavoidable necessity for him; he could not do without a servant.</p>
<p>One day many years later when this miser was quite old, he fell sick. He said to his servant, “All my life I have advised you. Now I need your advice. Tell me what I should do. If I go to a doctor, the doctor will ask for a fee. But if I don’t go, people will speak ill of me. They will say, ‘Look at this foolish man. He is sick, and still he won’t go to a doctor.’ Now what do you think? I don’t want to waste any money on a doctor. Do you think that I will die from this sickness?”</p>
<p>“Forgive me for saying this,” answered the servant, “but there is some possibility that you may die.”</p>
<p>At first the rich man became annoyed at this reply. Then he said, “All right. I have an excellent idea. Go to the undertaker and ask him how much money he will charge when I die. Then go to a doctor and find out how much it will cost to treat me.”</p>
<p>So the servant went to the undertaker, who told him that his lowest fee was 110 rupees, and to a doctor, who said that his minimum fee was 150 rupees. When the servant told this to his master, the master said, “In that case, the best thing is for me to go to the undertaker. The cure is too expensive.”</p>
<p>The old miser would not spend the extra forty rupees to cure his illness, and he soon died. Then the servant paid 110 rupees to the undertaker, and since his master had made no will, and had no family to claim his money, all the rest of it — thousands and thousands of rupees — went to the servant.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>Of course the miser was a fool. His attachment to his money became such an obsession at the end of his life that he preferred to die rather than part with any of it, not thinking that once he died his money would all be gone from him anyway. If he had had any sense, all the money that he had amassed he would have given to some charity or religious organisation. But he never even thought of giving it away. He only wanted to hoard and grasp. Why did he want to save money? Just in order to hear people say how rich he was. What would have happened if he had given the money to some worthy cause? His name would have become immortal. But instead he kept his money, and in the end the servant got it all. For the servant this conclusion is like a dream. All of a sudden he has become a millionaire. Everyone will exploit him, and the money will go to people who are not at all spiritual. It will go from one materialist to another materialist, and it will all be wasted.</p>
<p>The miser wanted to be very, very rich, and God made him rich. But if he had had a bit of generosity, a bit of spirituality, even a little brain-power, he could have made himself immortal by giving or just by willing his money to the right people. But he did not have that capacity. His life was all stupid selfishness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Son Of An Ass</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Son Of An Ass" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a minister who was also the court jester. He used to amuse the King with his wit, his talent and his earthly wisdom. The King was very fond of this particular minister.</p>
<p>One day the King was a bit upset. His favourite minister displeased him while he was in this mood, and he burst out, “You are the son of an ass!”</p>
<p>The minister immediately replied, “You are perfectly right in your statement. That is why I consider you to be my true father.”</p>
<p><em>Spiritual Comments</em></p>
<p>The son reflects the light of the father. If I am a spiritual man and you accept me as your true father, that means that you are also a spiritual man.</p>
<p>God is Divine. Since we are all His children, we are nothing but Divine.</p>
