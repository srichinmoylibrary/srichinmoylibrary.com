  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What happens to geniuses like Bach or Shakespeare after they die?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What happens to geniuses like Bach or Shakespeare after they die?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on God's Will and also the eagerness of the soul. If Bach played his role as a great, supreme musician, and if he does not want to manifest any more music, and if it is the Will of the Supreme, then he will give up that life totally. In his next incarnation he may enter into the field of literary activity. If Shakespeare has finished his role as a great writer and if he wants to enter into music, he can do it. Again, if Shakespeare and Bach feel that they have not played their roles satisfactorily, that they could give more to the literary world or to the musical world, then they will continue in the same field in their next incarnation.</p>
<p>We feel that Bach composed such great music. Who could be a better musician than he or who could be a greater writer than Shakespeare? But only the souls of these two great figures know whether they contributed to the fullest extent what they embodied and what they came here to give us. If they have given everything, then they don't have to go through literary life or music life any more. But if they have not given everything and if they want to continue, and if the Will of the Supreme is for them to continue and give more of their soul-stirring music or soul-elevating literature, then they will give. Again, they may not want to continue this particular game. On the sports field, a game lasts for forty-five minutes or an hour. If one plays for forty-five minutes and then becomes tired, he may say, "I do not want to play this game anymore; I am ready to play some other game. I was playing football and it was very exhausting; now I want to play something else, some indoor game." And then God may say, "All right, you don't have to play that game. You can play some other game. I am offering you My Compassion."</p>
<p>Usually great geniuses like Shakespeare and Bach have completed their roles. Then, God may take them into science or spirituality. In the case of Bach, he had already accepted spirituality, whereas Shakespeare had not consciously accepted spirituality. So Bach's music is full of spirituality. But Shakespeare's higher ideals are not spiritual; they are something else. Spirituality is everywhere, true, but you have to know what spirituality you are aiming at. The one has already touched spirituality; the other has not properly touched the real spirituality. It is entirely up to God's Will what they will do next.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any question you cannot answer?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any question you cannot answer?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I use my mind, there will be millions of questions that I cannot answer. But if I use my oneness-heart with the Absolute Supreme, there will be no question that I will not be able to answer, if it has to do with spirituality. Thousands of times I have answered questions, believe me, and when I heard it on the tape or read it in the book, I could not believe that it was I who had said it. Or after I have answered a question, when everything is all done and my physical mind gets the message of the answer that I have given, I cannot believe that I have answered that question. When I try to understand the question afterwards, I cannot understand it. It has happened to me once or twice that I have answered a question one hundred per cent correctly; but if I use my mind in order to know what the question is, I do not even understand the question. So how many times I have answered questions most correctly on the strength of my heart's oneness with God's Will. My heart immediately becomes one with God's Will. Many times it has happened that before the question is even formulated, just when the person opens his mouth, the question has already come to me. You are standing with the question and you have completed two or three words, but your question has already come to me and the answer has already come to me. Then you go on, go on, using so many words; but it is all unnecessary. When you open your mouth, the question and the answer both have come together, and I am just waiting for you to complete your question.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is it that some religions do not mention reincarnation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is it that some religions do not mention reincarnation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some religions say, "Our Father is in Heaven. He is there and we are here, in hell." So naturally they try to go to Heaven, where He is. And then, once they are there, they say, "Oh, He is our Beloved. Are we such fools that we will come back to earth? Who needs reincarnation?"</p>
<p>But if we know that He is in Heaven and also here on earth, then naturally we will come back. Wherever we are, God, poor fellow, is also there; He is bound to be with us. If we are on the ground floor, in the basement, He is also there. And also when we are on the top floor, in the attic, He is with us. So if you accept God's Universality, then you know that reincarnation is absolutely real. But if you accept only God the Transcendental Height, then you will only stay with Him upstairs. You shall not come back. When people say that God is only in Heaven, it creates a problem. But if we say He is both in Heaven and on earth, then this problem doesn't arise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At times the vibration of a city is like the aspiration of its inhabitants. And also, the inhabitants may have a vibration of their own. It is like a house. A house has a vibration of its own and the inhabitants also have a vibration of their own. The inhabitants have a vibration and they are giving it to the house; and the house has some vibration, which it is giving to the inhabitants.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are there delicate and beautiful worlds of the psychic imagination that the artist should try to seek access to for inspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are there delicate and beautiful worlds of the psychic imagination that the artist should try to seek access to for inspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are many, many beautiful, delicate psychic worlds. You are using the term 'imagination', but this is absolutely wrong. These are not imagination; they are psychic realities. What you call imagination is not imagination as such; it is a reality in another world. Here on earth we call it imagination. But when we go to a higher plane, where we get the message of creativity, the light of creativity, it is not imagination at all. It is real. Only we don't see its reality in the physical form here. We are on the first floor and a flower is on the second floor. We don't see the flower because we are on the first floor. But when the fragrance comes down, we know there is a flower, a source, and the source is on the second floor.</p>
<p>So imagination is a world of its own, a reality-world. But here we don't see it because it is stationed a little higher. The good artist must always seek access to the higher worlds for inspiration, for if one wants to create something, one has to get something from a higher plane. Then only will the world be illumined and fulfilled. Anything that comes from above has more beauty in it, more purity in it, more reality in it. Our goal is to bring down from above divinity, reality, beauty — everything that is divine.</p>
<p>The imagination-world is not a mental hallucination; it is reality-world far above this physical world. Let us try to have an access to this world so we can get inspiration and create something new, something unprecedented.</p>

<h2>Question: When I do my daily activities, I do not feel concerned about them. Is this the right attitude?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are doing your daily activities you should pray to the Supreme, to the Inner Pilot, who is operating in and through you. God has infinite Concern for human beings in each of their activities. If you are not concerned, that is a mistake. You will have concern, but you will not feel that this concern is coming from you. Feel that it is coming from somewhere else and that an Inner Hand is guiding you. This is the right approach.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you perform meditation and concentration, if you can&#039;t break through the electromagnetic field around you, it will cause a certain amount of frustration, since you are not able to express what is inside you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you perform meditation and concentration, if you can&#039;t break through the electromagnetic field around you, it will cause a certain amount of frustration, since you are not able to express what is inside you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you concentrate or meditate, you have to surrender to God's Will. The will that is inside your concentration, the will that is in your meditation, you have to surrender to God's Will. If you really love God, then you have to surrender the capacity that you have and also the results that you get from your capacity. When you concentrate dynamically and powerfully, then you have to feel that your capacity has come from God. When you soulfully meditate, you have to feel that this capacity has also come from God. Now, if the result that you want you are not getting, then you should not be disturbed. A child knows how to crawl, but he wants to walk. He will definitely be able to walk one day, but today he can only crawl. Just because he can't reach his goal today, he will not give up his desire to walk. He will crawl today and one day he will be able to walk. While you are concentrating, you meet with some obstruction, some frustration-barrier. If you are not achieving the thing that you want, naturally you will meet with frustration. But you have to take this frustration as a barrier that can be easily overcome. It is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>It is like walking through a tunnel. You know that on the other side there will be light. Right now it is night, but light is bound to come. If you can take frustration as night, then you will know that a few hours later there will be day. But if you feel that only night exists, that there is a barrier and there is nothing beyond that barrier, then you are making a mistake.</p>
<p>When we concentrate, we pierce like a bullet through the thing that is standing in our way. But when we meditate, we don't reject the thing. Because of our oneness with God, we try to accept the obstruction and illumine it. Anything that is discouraging or destructive in us, we don't discard. If we leave aside frustration or other negative things, then they remain on earth and bother somebody else. So when it is a matter of concentration, we will cast aside all obstructions; but when it is a matter of meditation, when our mind has achieved vastness, we will accept obstructions and transform them. In the beginning, when we want to run towards our goal, we don't keep anything negative. But when we reach our goal, then we have to feel that the things we have left aside may create problems for our brothers and sisters. So after reaching our goal, we will come back to illumine them so that they won't stand in the way of others.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we know who is our real teacher?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we know who is our real teacher?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you see four or five persons in front of you, automatically one person attracts most of your attention, or gives you much more joy. Four persons are walking along the street, but when you look at one of them, you will get tremendous joy. That means that you have already become aware in the inner world of your affinity with that particular person. Your mind cannot account for it, but your soul has already recognised its oneness.</p>
<p>A teacher is supposed to be your most intimate, eternal friend. If I give you more joy than other teachers, then I am your teacher. If somebody else gives you much more joy, then that person is your teacher. It is like choosing a school. There are quite a few schools; so you go to a school that you like. You are under no compulsion to go to a particular school. Just because you like a particular school, just because you like the teachers of that school, you will go there. In the spiritual life also, when a seeker sincerely wants help from a spiritual Master, he makes a choice. The one that gives him utmost joy, the one for whom he feels utmost love, is the right one for him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there such a thing as false light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there such a thing as false light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there is false light. There are many destructive forces which attack light and use it to deceive seekers. We can tell whether it is true or false light by seeing if it is all purity. If it is false light, there will be a certain amount of impurity.</p>
<p>These false, destructive forces often take the form of the cosmic gods. Once a hostile force came to me in the form of Vishnu. I was meditating at about half-past two or three o'clock in the morning and this force came and stood in front of me. I was about fifteen or sixteen years of age and I had seen Vishnu three or four times before. He is a most beautiful god. When I concentrated on this being, I noticed impurity within him, so I did not bow down to him. Then a tremendous fight took place and after three or four minutes the figure of Vishnu exploded. There was a tremendous noise and my brother came running to my room. They even heard it in the house right down the street. They all wondered what had happened at that time of the morning. They thought the stove had exploded. But my brother was the only one I told. On another occasion I was attacked by a hostile force during my meditation; then, afterwards, I discovered that my mosquito net had been torn to shreds.</p>
<p>Very often a hostile force takes the form of a seeker's own Guru. The seeker has to be absolutely certain it is his Guru. Otherwise, if he bows down to it, it can cause real harm on the physical plane. It can harm our limbs, even give us a heart attack or stroke. Once a hostile force appeared before the dearest disciple of a spiritual Master. When she saw her Master in front of her she was overjoyed, and she immediately bowed down. Then she was at the mercy of this hostile force and immediately suffered a heart attack. Afterwards, it went upstairs to see who else it could find. But it found only one of the ordinary disciples. When this disciple bowed down to it, the demon could not be bothered with him. It felt it was beneath its dignity in that particular case, and it went away.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful that the light you see is real light. Never bow to any form which appears before you unless you feel peace and purity in it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is God wholly good, or is He both good and evil?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is God wholly good, or is He both good and evil?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is both good and evil and, again, He is above them both. It is like a tree. Let us say the roots are evil and the branches are good. But they are one; they are part of the same tree. Evil is a lower manifestation of Truth and good is a higher manifestation of Truth. There is no night without light; even in the blackest night there is always at least an iota of light. But God is in both of these and above them both, as the sky is above the tree. If you say God is not in evil, then you are saying that God is not omnipresent. And that is like saying that God is not God. God is in both, but He is not bound by them. He is like a boat which is in the water and also above the water.</p>
<p>From the strictly spiritual point of view, there is no such thing as good or evil. Evil only exists in the mental world. What we think of as being evil is actually lesser truth or imperfection growing into greater truth or more perfect reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you please explain what shakti is and its role in Creation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you please explain what &lt;em&gt;shakti&lt;/em&gt; is and its role in Creation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy: </em>Shakti/ is the source of infinite Energy. This infinite Energy can be transmitted as infinite Light, infinite Peace, infinite Bliss. With this Power, we can climb up the tree, we can climb back down, we can walk, we can run, we can fly, we can dive, we can do anything that we want to do. Power is necessary capacity. Naturally we need the necessary capacity for flying, for running, for each activity we do. So this capacity is power here.</p>
<p>On the spiritual plane, God is infinite Light. This infinite Light is also infinite Energy and infinite Peace. Peace is Power and Power is Peace. Light is Power and Power is Light. It is the movement that is <em>shakti.</em> God has two aspects: one is His static aspect and the other is His dynamic aspect. When He wants to manifest, He employs His dynamic capacity, while His other aspect remains silent. Here <em>shakti</em> becomes the universal manifesting Force.</p>
<p>How is it that we say that the Power aspect of the Supreme created the Universe? If we say that the Power aspect can only create something vast, then we are mistaken. If God has infinite Power, then with His infinite Power He can create something vast and also something very tiny. Infinite Power does not mean that He can create only something big. If the infinite Power can create the vast, then it can also create a grain of sand.</p>
<p>Infinite Power is experienced in various forms inside the heart of each seeker. One seeker will experience Power as Bliss, another will experience it as Peace, a third as Light; and a fourth will experience it as Consciousness.</p>
<p>The seeker feels and experiences <em>shakti</em>, the Power, inside him, according to his own evolution. <em>Shakti</em> is the manifestation of God's Vision. When this manifestation takes form, each individual has the right to issue a name to it. The Form remains the same, but the seeker recognises the Form, accepts the Form, in various ways. Then, when this Power operates inside the seeker, if the seeker needs Peace, he will call it Peace. If the seeker needs Light, then he will call that Power Light. If somebody needs Delight, then he will take that Power as Delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each soul has a task and you can know it only through your sincere aspiration. Let us take each soul as a limb of God's own Existence. With His Hand He does one thing, with His Nose He does something else, with His Eye and Ear something else. It is like a football game. Somebody has to play at the goalpost, somebody has to play on the left and somebody has to be on the right. If all the players stay at the goal, there will be no game. No, the players have to be well distributed. So like that, each soul has its respective job to do. And you will know which position you are going to play only when you deal with the captain. God will tell you where your post is.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between intelligence and consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between intelligence and consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Intelligence is limited. Someone may have a bigger thumb than someone else, but at most it is only half an inch or so bigger, and this is not very important. Intelligence also can be a little bigger or smaller, but it is finite and will always remain so.</p>
<p>With consciousness it is quite different. Consciousness is vast, very vast. The finite consciousness is itself finite, but it is capable of expanding into infinite consciousness, into the Infinite itself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a Master comes to someone in a dream, it means that the soul of that particular person has already recognised the Master. Like a magnet, the soul is pulling the Master's love, concern, blessings and affection. The soul is pulling the presence of that Master. Then, a few days or a few months later, the physical mind, the earthly, physical eyes will be able to see the Master. The soul has recognised the Master on the soul's plane, the inner plane; then it has transmitted this truth, this reality, to the dream-plane, to the dream-consciousness. From the dream-consciousness, in the course of time, the reality will come to the physical consciousness, to the physical plane. It is a very good sign, a very good indication, that sooner or later the student will be able to meet with his Master.</p>
