<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual significance I can give, and if that doesn't satisfy you, then you can go to the doctor and see if your eyesight is all right. But I wish to tell you that the light that you see is inner light, and you are seeing it with your inner vision. You are seeing a subtle light around my eyebrows or around my eyes, which belong to the physical in me. This indicates that your inner vision has accepted the physical and also is encouraging the physical. When you see the light circling around my eye, you have to know that my physical part has become one with your aspiration. I embody the aspiration of the physical in you and in all the disciples. While you are aspiring you are seeing the physical in me as well as the spiritual in me. The two cannot be separated. The light is the spiritual in me and the eyes are the physical. The spiritual is always trying to help the physical. So your aspiration, your inner cry right now is crying to be supported or encouraged or fulfilled by the spiritual.</p>
<p>When you think of yourself, think that inside the physical is your inner cry, your aspiration and your dedication. This aspiration and dedication will not go on in vain; they will be crowned with success. They will be garlanded by the physical and the spiritual. The physical inside you is aspiring and the reality from above, from deep within, will come and garland the aspiration of the physical.</p>
<p>So the light that you see is the light of the Beyond. When you see it circling around the eye, it means that the spiritual is encouraging the physical in order to elevate and transform the physical and fulfil the message of the higher reality. The physical is aspiring and a response is coming from the reality and divinity beyond the physical. Very good experience, wonderful experience!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III: Questions and answers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III: Questions and answers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Guru, you once said that if you come two minutes late to God, then He will not even open the door for you. This makes me unhappy.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you think that you have come late to God? Just because you have only recently joined our Centre, you may think that you have come here late. But this is not correct. When you come, <em>that</em> is your time — not when the Centre was inaugurated.</p>
<p>Everybody has a special hour of his own. When the hour strikes for you, that is your time. If the hour strikes for somebody else two years earlier, then that is his time. Inwardly you will know when your hour has struck. Let us say that fifteen years ago you inwardly felt a very strong pull toward the spiritual life; you felt that without God, you could not last on earth even for a fleeting second. If you had that kind of aspiration but did not go to any spiritual Master or follow any path, it means that fifteen years you have wasted. Therefore, God will be displeased with you. He will say, "I gave you a golden chance to come out of ignorance, but you did not value it."</p>
<p>But in your case, you don't have to feel at all sorry, because God did not give you that intense aspiration fifteen years ago. But now God <em>has</em> given you the aspiration. Now God <em>has</em> knocked at your door and your time has come. Before you were sleeping, but now God wants you to get up. If you say, "Don't disturb me, don't bother me, I want to sleep," then God will be displeased with you. But you are not sleeping, so you should not feel at all sorry. The time has dawned for you and you have awakened. But if the time comes and you neglect it, if you refuse to accept it, then you are making a very serious mistake.</p>
<p>So do not worry. You have done absolutely the right thing. If I have accepted someone, then it is the proper time for him. Do not feel depressed or deserted. You have God's infinite Love and Blessings. If two or three years ago He did not ask you to do something, it is not your fault. You are listening to the inner request of the Supreme at this time, so you are doing the right thing. Don't feel at all depressed or sorry, That applies to all of you. It is only the one who comes late who will feel that he has missed the boat.</p>
<p>Now you are in the Boat of the Supreme, so you are safe; you are bound to reach the Golden Shore. But on the way, if you become depressed or doubtful and you jump out of the Boat, then again you will fall into the sea of ignorance. There are quite a few who have come and gone. But in comparison to the number of people who have stayed with us, the number who have left is next to nothing. I have been extremely careful right from the beginning. If I had wanted to, by this time I could have had thousands of disciples. But I am very selective. As soon as people hear our standard, they find it too difficult. Even our outer standard is difficult. If people find our path very difficult, it is all right; God wants us to follow this path.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak a little about how a new disciple should handle the pleasures and problems of daily life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak a little about how a new disciple should handle the pleasures and problems of daily life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us deal with problems first. First you have to ask whether or not these problems that you now have existed before. Immediately the answer will come: yes. So how is it that now you are aware of them, and at that time you were not aware of them? You have to know that when you live an ordinary, unaspiring life, the hostile forces are clever. They know that you are at their mercy. They know your capacity; they know that you are in ignorance and at their feet. So they say, "All right, since he is sleeping, let us not bother him." But the moment you are up, they are going to attack you.</p>
<p>There are many seekers who complain to their Master, "Before we accepted the spiritual life, we had fewer problems. Now that we have accepted the spiritual life, our problems have increased. But it is not true. They must know that these same problems they did have; only they did not consciously want to conquer them. That's why they were not aware of them. If you don't want to conquer something, then you are fast asleep and the problem is fast asleep. But now that you have entered into the spiritual life, you are challenging all your problems. Since you are challenging the problems, the hostile forces stand with them and try to fight you. They feed the problems so that they can continue the fight. But these forces know that they will not be able to conquer you. Only they will try to delay, delay. So you have to challenge them.</p>
<p>Before you accepted the spiritual life, you thought that the life of ignorance, the life of pleasure, was the right life. You looked around and you saw that everybody was enjoying the life of pleasure. You said, "So what is wrong with me? If my friends, my neighbours, and everybody is in the same boat, then I don't want to be an exception." But now that you have accepted the spiritual life, you feel that the life they're leading is not meant for you. You have got now an inner call, a higher call. You can't be with them. Yes, you stayed with them for fifteen years or twenty years. Now the time has come for you to follow something else, to do something else. If you don't accept problems as such, how are you going to conquer them? If you try to avoid problems, they will come to you with more power. Most vehemently they will come and attack you. So you cannot hide from your problems. You have to conquer them here and now. If you wait and say, "No, tomorrow I will have more strength, and then I will be able to conquer my problems," I tell you that <em>that</em> tomorrow will not come. Each second is a golden opportunity, and if you misuse this golden opportunity, then you are strengthening unconsciously the forces of ignorance.</p>
<p>Now, about the life of pleasure. You have to know what you have received or achieved from the life of pleasure. Immediately you will say, "The life of pleasure has given me one thing and that is frustration." Even if you remain in the ordinary life, the unaspiring life, if you are sincere then you will say, "All I have gained from this life of pleasure is frustration." And then what happens? You see that there is no hope of coming out of this frustration unless and until you are destroyed totally.</p>
<p>What today we call frustration, tomorrow will be destruction. We started our journey with temptation. Then, in temptation there was pleasure. And inside pleasure is destruction. After destruction, what remains? Nothing. So the path of pleasure is the negative way of proceeding.</p>
<p>Then there is a positive way. That positive way is aspiration. What is aspiration? Aspiration is the inner cry that makes us feel that we have come from the infinite Peace, Light and Bliss and that we still embody this infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, only we have to bring these qualities to the fore. Now, unconsciously we have these qualities. Unconsciously we have someone called God. But spiritual life means our conscious awareness of God.</p>
<p>You have the treasure within you, but you have misplaced it. When you misplace something, you search for it, but you may not find it immediately. So you ask your friend, your dearest friend, to help you search: "I have lost something; will you search for it along with me?" The friend comes, and since he is more expert than you in finding things, he finds it for you. Who is that friend? He is your spiritual Master. Once he finds your treasure, he does not take it away from you. He will not dare to take it away from you just because he has found it on your behalf. A spiritual Master is like that. He finds your inner treasure for you, and then his role is over. Your role is only to thank him. He finds it for you, then it becomes your treasure. You just thank him.</p>
<p>The life of pleasure has to be replaced by the life of aspiration. In aspiration is the real treasure, the realisation that you come from the Infinite, that you are in the Infinite and that you are for the Infinite Truth and Light.</p>
<p>Each person has a friend and an enemy. If he aspires, then he feels that desire is his enemy and aspiration is his friend. If he does not aspire, if he is leading a life of desire, then he feels that desire is his friend and aspiration is his enemy. He is familiar with desire, even if it is not fulfilling him, he is aware of its reality in his life, whereas aspiration is a stranger to him. So he feels that desire is his friend. But eventually each individual will realise that his one and only friend is aspiration. There will come a time when each individual will feel that realisation does exist, that God does exist. And when that time comes, he will dive into the sea of spirituality and claim the life of aspiration as his own, his very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Today we had a divine competition among ten disciples to see who did the best meditation. Do you think that there is anybody who did not hope that he would be first? The student cannot be the judge. On many occasions his intellect works and he thinks that he does extremely well. But I am dealing with your soul. I am not dealing with your mind or physical or vital. I am interested only in the consciousness that is in your heart, in your soul. If you had thoughts just for a few seconds, it will not affect your consciousness. If your board is white and you have touched one spot with a dark finger, I may not see the spot. I see the large view, the whole wall. You are seeing where you have put the dot, but I am not seeing that portion. With my compassion I am seeing the whole wall. But if you make a spot again and again and again, then I see that you are the culprit.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we deal with the discouragement that comes from trying to sustain a lot of activities after we get physically exhausted from the pace?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we deal with the discouragement that comes from trying to sustain a lot of activities after we get physically exhausted from the pace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why should we be discouraged? Discouragement is not something that can help us. Anything that does not help us we must not take as our friend. Let us take discouragement as our enemy. Once we take it as our enemy, we won't allow it to enter into our system. But right now we feel that discouragement is something necessary in our life. It is something very pleasant. Sometimes frustration gives us joy. Depression gives us joy. But these are all negative things.</p>
<p>If we are discouraged, immediately we have to feel that an enemy has entered into us. We are all God's children and we have no enemies. But we have to know that right now there are things that are standing in our way, which can make us helpless. So the best thing is to take them as enemies; in this way we will always be alert. Once we have conquered these forces, at that time they will not be our enemies; they will have no power. But right now discouragement, frustration and depression are more powerful than we are, and we have to consider them as our enemies. When we conquer them, then they become ours.</p>
<p>Very often our good qualities are captured by the undivine qualities. In the morning we have aspiration to get up, but then lethargy comes and we do not get up until seven or eight o'clock. So the bad forces have won. But again, if the good forces increase our aspiration to get up early in the morning, at that time even if the wrong forces come and tempt us to sleep a few minutes more, still we get up. Then lethargy is conquered.</p>
<p>So in the beginning we have to take discouragement and other wrong forces as our enemies, until we have conquered them. What does an enemy do? An enemy makes us alert and an enemy makes us perfect. A friend does not make us perfect; it is an enemy that makes us perfect. You have told millions of lies, true; but your friend will not point out one lie, one weakness of yours. That kind of thing your friend is not going to do. If he is really a spiritual friend, then he may point it out; but if he is an ordinary friend he will say, "No, if I tell him, then I will hurt him and I will lose him." Spiritual Masters are the real friends of the disciples. Very often they become blunt. They tell the disciples what their weaknesses are. The Master says to the disciple, "Even if I lose you as an individual, God is not going to lose you. So let God take care of you."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the hour comes, feel that it is the most important moment in your life. When we sail in a boat with others, we should be fair to the boatman and the passengers. The boatman is ready, but one passenger is delaying. It is time to sail the boat, but although the boatman shouts and screams, that person is not getting up. We are a spiritual family. If one member is delaying everyone, it is your duty to scold him and say, "What are you doing? For you we shall all be delayed." If someone does not get up, at times I have shown a compassionate face and at times I have shown a face of displeasure, irony or terrible disgust, or I have scolded the person mercilessly. If some close disciples do not get up in the morning, I will first show a sad face and then a distressed face. Nothing works permanently, but sadness sometimes works for a few days. If somebody sees my sad face, then he will make every effort to meditate for a few days. Again, some people feel that they don't need to meditate regularly. So what can I do? No matter what kind of sadness or distress I show them, they will not meditate regularly,</p>

But so many times the physical world disappears and I have to make an effort to bring it back into focus." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to bring it back? When did I say you have to look at me? I only ask you to keep your eyes open. If you keep your eyes open when I bring down Peace or Light, then immediately it convinces your physical mind. Otherwise, in the name of meditation you will enter into sleep, and no matter what I bring down you remain in the oblivion-world. If you keep your eyes open, how long can you daydream? An insect will come along and bite you. Somebody will make a noise. There are many things to keep you awake. But when you keep your eyes closed, automatically you are surrendering to a kind of sleep. You think you are meditating, but you are in the sleep world. If you can keep your eyes open, you can receive continuously. Otherwise, it is better to keep them half open. Some disciples keep their eyes open, but they are daydreaming. Some, as soon as they close their eyes, go to the other world.</p>
<p>When I first started meditating in 1944, for the first few months I was inwardly commanded to keep my eyes open. Then I developed the capacity to meditate with my eyes closed or open. But I feel that meditation with the eyes open is the meditation of the lion. If you can meditate with your eyes open, that means you are a lion. You can devour any wrong forces around you. If you keep your eyes closed, you are meditating like a cat. Anybody can come and devour you. When you have the lion-meditation, you can see a monkey moving around and you are not affected. But if you keep your eyes closed and somebody touches you, you may think that somebody has come to stab you and be frightened to death.</p>

JH 23e1. The following is drawn from an article entitled "The Jewel of Humility" which appeared in the November 1975 issue of the New Age Community, a monthly publication published by the New Age Community Centre in Vancouver, B. C., Canada. The New Age Community staff interviewed Sri Chinmoy at the Vancouver International Airport as he was departing after a brief visit to Victoria, where he had given a talk on the devotional path of life. (The New Age Community is hereafter referred to as NAC.)</p>
<h2>NAC: It is a great honour to meet you; we've heard a lot about you over the years. What does your work generally consist of?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My work is love and my work is service. I try to love mankind and I try to serve mankind according to the limited capacity that God has granted me. To love Him in aspiring mankind and to serve Him by serving mankind — this is my only work.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have about sixty Centres all over the world. From time to time I visit all the Centres and they keep inner contact with me. I have written over two hundred fifty books. I go to the United Nations twice a week and hold meditation for the delegates and the members of the staff. I try to serve mankind in the community of nations according to my inner capacity, which I call my devoted soulful service. This is what I do. Everywhere I try to serve and whenever I get an opportunity to serve, I feel my life on earth is worth living.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes and no. Not in their political capacity. But when they come to me as seekers, since I myself am a seeker, I can talk to them on a spiritual level — but not on a political level. Politics is not my forte, whereas I know a little bit about spirituality. So, when the politicians come to me as seekers, I try to offer light to them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a difficult question to answer. There are some politicians who do not want to disclose their names, but they do take my help secretly. They don't want to be exposed; they don't want to attach themselves to the so-called religious or spiritual life. But when we have soulful meetings, they come and join us in their capacity as seekers and not in their capacity as politicians.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I fully agree with you. What we should do is to cultivate more soulful patience. Right now the world is far from perfection. It is an almost half-animal world that we are living in. We are constantly quarrelling and fighting. But again, there is an inner cry in us to do something, to become something, to grow into something that will give us abiding satisfaction. This inner cry is something that wants to transcend what we have now and what we are now. But perfection does not come into existence overnight. It takes time.</p>
<p>What you need, what I need, what others need, is one thing: soulful patience. We have to know that patience is not something weak. If we are patient, it does not mean that we are forced to surrender to the hard reality of life. No, it is inner wisdom. Our inner wisdom needs patience, a length of time. It is like a seed. As soon as we see a seed, we expect the seed to grow into a plant and become a tree, a huge banyan tree. But the seed takes time to germinate and gradually become a plant and then a tree. If we have the vision of our patience, then one day we will see that truth will manifest and grow into Reality. So what the entire world needs is soulful patience. Then the truth can grow in its own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here I wish to say that the best policy is to first become something and then do something. First achieve, then give what you have. This is the golden rule. First you become the fruit, the most delicious fruit, and then you offer yourself for everybody to eat. But in cases where one is being guided by a higher force, a special rule applies. If the higher force says, "I need you as my instrument," or "I have accepted you as my instrument, so you please me in my own way," at that time the process is reversed. In that case, if the Inner Pilot or spiritual Master tells you, "Do this," then in the process of doing you are becoming. When this happens, then you have to listen to the dictates of your Master, for the Master is representing God for you. When Krishna says to Arjuna, "Surrender to me, I will do everything for you," at that time Arjuna is only an instrument. Here Arjuna has obtained free access to the Inner Pilot. The Inner Pilot says, "Do this, and in the process of doing, you will become what I want you to become." But you have to know whether you really have free access to the Inner Pilot or not.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a most interesting question. The mind here creates tremendous problems for us. If we want to recognise the message or the voice of the Inner Pilot, then we have to know one thing: As soon as we get the message of the Inner Pilot, we will see that this message is giving us inner joy and inner satisfaction. Then, as soon as we carry out the message, the message will bear fruit in the form of success or failure. But if we can take the result with the same cheerfulness, the same amount of inner strength, inner courage and equanimity whether it is success or failure, then we can be certain that the message to do this deed came from the soul. Otherwise, we will be raised to the skies if something comes in the form of success and we will be doomed to disappointment if failure appears.</p>
<p>So, if the message comes directly from the deep inmost reaches of our heart, from our soul, then the result will not be important. If we can see both success and failure as an experience which is helping us to grow into the supreme Reality, if we have that kind of feeling for the message that is coming forward, then we are getting the message from within, from the Inner Pilot.</p>

We may do everything wrong, but out of His infinite Bounty, God will give us eternal time to turn over a new leaf.</p>
