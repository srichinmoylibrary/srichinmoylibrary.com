<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you have to know what happens to you when you see the physical beauty of someone. An old acquaintance by the name of jealousy enters into you. You say, "Oh, I am not as beautiful as so-and-so." We always feel that others have more beauty than we have. They feel that they are ugliness incarnate and you feel that you yourself are ugliness incarnate. This experience never ends. After you observe somebody's outer beauty, very often you feel jealousy. But instead of being jealous when you see somebody's outer beauty, try to have a divine attitude. You can say, "If it were at all necessary for me to be as beautiful as she, I am sure that God would have made me as beautiful. So it is not necessary for me."What happens when you are aware of somebody's inner beauty? When you are aware of somebody's inner beauty, it means that you are in the inner world. When you are in the inner world, there is no competition. If you are aware of somebody's inner beauty you will never be jealous. In the inner world, you feel the inner beauty of that particular person as your very own. When you go deep within, anything that you see in somebody you will not see as his individual property; you will see it as the universal property. In this way, if you see the beauty of someone else, you will feel that that beauty equally belongs to you, because inner beauty is part of the universal Reality. If you want to be aware of other people's inner beauty, try to go deep within. Live in your heart and your soul, not in your mind. Then you will feel that whatever you see in others is also yours.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most beautiful thing on earth is our heart's gratitude to the Supreme, to the divinity in humanity, to God. This is the best and most valuable thing on earth. This is the beauty unparalleled, and it will remain so throughout Eternity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The lesser beauty will always try to bind and limit us. The higher beauty will always try to illumine and liberate us. The moment the higher beauty dawns in us, we will feel others as our very own and we will try to liberate them. And while having that kind of feeling, we will see that we are already received and claimed by others as their very own. When the higher beauty dawns in us, we see that what we do for others, they have already done for us. When we have the higher beauty, it means that the finite in us has gone and we are trying to make the infinite our own. The moment we try to bring down the infinite as our own, to our wide surprise we will feel that it has already claimed us as its very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can always see beauty within yourself only by praying and meditating. When you pray, you have to think that your Source is one; and when you meditate, you have to feel that you are for all. When you are praying to the One, you are going up, up, up to the Highest. When you are meditating on the many, you are spreading your light to all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, you have to become inseparably one with light instead of with darkness and ignorance. If you become inseparably one with light, which is wisdom, automatically you become one with beauty. First you have to become one with the Source. When you become one with the Source, naturally the possessions of the Source will become yours. If you become one with the consciousness of a tree, then you have also become one with the consciousness of the flowers and leaves of the tree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are sensitive to beauty, but becoming upset when you notice ugliness all around you does not help you increase your sense of beauty or your capacity to appreciate beauty. So you have to become wise. If there is light somewhere, you try to increase this light to more light, abundant light, infinite Light. But if you see darkness somewhere, you don't do this. Your goal, let us say, is to the north, not to the south. If you look toward the south, you see that it is all flooded with darkness. So do not look in that direction. You will not even look at it. Inside yourself you want beauty and light; but this moment you look at beauty and see it in an infinitesimal measure, and the next moment you look at ugliness and see a flood of ugliness. This is wrong. Once you see beauty at a particular place, either inside yourself or around you, try to focus your attention on that particular place. When you focus your attention on the place where you have seen beauty, your appreciation of this beauty will increase. But if you see ugliness and become upset, you will not be able to focus your attention on the things that you want to see. Although your present is not flooded with light, although you cannot quite see the Goal, you know the road. The road that leads to infinite Light you have seen. So you will not consciously and deliberately take the road that leads to infinite darkness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Beauty's evolving manifestation in man is man's increasingly conscious awareness of his ultimate height and his God-ordained mission on earth. The more he is aware of his transcendental height, the sooner he will be manifesting beauty. His God-ordained mission is to expand his own inner and outer reality. His inner reality is his dream; his outer reality is his conscious appreciation of his own achievements.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Precisely because the beauty of nature is the expression of the One who is all Beauty. Whenever we see something, we see inside that thing the inner presence, the inner consciousness, of its creator. The Creator of nature is God Himself. He expresses Himself in and through Nature. When we see nature's beauty, we get overwhelming joy because the Creator and Owner is God. When we see a house, if we love the owner, we love the possession. The One who is all Beauty is inside His creation, like a mother's heart is inside her child. A mother's heart cannot be separated from the child's existence. Just because we appreciate, admire, adore and worship the One who is all Beauty, we appreciate His creation as well. Sometimes when we want to see the mother, we get joy just by seeing the child because we have found somebody who is part and parcel of her being. The creation itself is part and parcel of the Creator. Since the Creator is not at our beck and call right now, we are satisfied with the creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the physical plane, we wear shoes when we go outside so that our feet do not touch the ground and get hurt. When there is something undivine, something that may hurt us, we take precautions to protect ourselves. Similarly, when we go to any undivine place, we need protection. When we are at home, when we are not in the battlefield of life, we are protected. But as soon as we go out into the street, we come face to face with a hungry lion. He is more powerful, infinitely more powerful, than we are. At those times we have to become more cautious and conscious. When we are in broad daylight, we do not worry. But when it is very dark we feel that some undivine force will attack us, so we become more cautious. How do we become more cautious and conscious? By remembering the necessity for aspiration, and by remembering the Supreme Pilot within us more often. In order to manifest the beauty in evolution, or in order to become beauty itself in the process of evolution, man has to feel that his Source is Delight, and that he exists on earth only for Delight. While he is manifesting beauty, he has to feel that beauty is nothing short of Delight. In thinking of beauty, in imagining beauty, in revealing beauty, in offering beauty, he has to feel that he is playing with Delight, dancing with Delight, drinking Delight and sharing Delight with the rest of mankind. This is how beauty can be manifested in the process of evolution.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you mean by wearing all kinds of make-up, then yes, it is unspiritual. But if somebody does not take a shower or wash his hair for three weeks and then starts taking a shower and washing his hair every day, this enhances his physical beauty in a very spiritual way. If you comb your hair, if you wear clean clothes, it adds to your beauty. You may say, "If I don't clean my body or comb my hair, what right do you have to complain?" But I do have a right, because when you are dirty and untidy, at that time you are representing ugliness to me. Now what right do you have to bring ugliness into my life? When people in the street are not washed, they will say, "It is our body." But if it is their body, then they should stay inside their room. They don't have to come out. If they do, they are either unconsciously or deliberately poisoning our eyes. We are trying to be normal and natural, but they are acting like abnormal creatures. Like animals, they are just roaming wild and we cannot find any beauty to appreciate in them. Because of their untidiness and ugliness, others suffer. The lower consciousness which they embody does not stay with them; it immediately enters into us. It is good to make yourself pleasant in appearance, but do not do anything that is not natural and normal. If you want to wear all kinds of cosmetics, that will be a terrible mistake. But if you can be clean and neat and always keep your body in a pure consciousness, if you can keep your mind calm and quiet and serene, and if your vital is dynamic and not aggressive, then automatically your face changes. If the body is not lethargic, but active and ready to serve, if the body-consciousness is awakened, then automatically the face changes. There are so many spiritual things one can do to make oneself more beautiful in a natural and normal way. Constantly the inner is perfecting the outer. If you want to enhance your physical beauty, then do it in a way that will also be of help to your spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three principal things that obscure our inner beauty: lack of clarity in the mind, lack of purity in the vital and lack of sincerity in the body. If the body-consciousness is sincere, the vital pure and the mind clear, then we automatically get inner beauty. In the absence of these divine qualities, we see ugliness in ourselves.</p>

I may have entered into a world of beauty, or my soul at that time may want to offer some light to seekers who will receive it according to their capacity. This light can be felt by one person's physical mind as beauty and it can be felt by someone else as power. Whether it is seen as beauty or power, it will be able to elevate your consciousness. If your physical mind sees light as beauty, and if somebody else's mind sees it as power, there is a special reason. On that particular day, if something has happened to bring ugliness into your life, then you need beauty; so you will see beauty. Somebody else may have felt insecure or might have done something wrong on that day, so if he sees my power aspect he won't make the same mistake again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all we have to feel that the soul is all beauty only for one reason: because the soul is consciously aware of God. The soul is consciously aware of God at every second, twenty-four hours a day. That is why the soul is all beauty. If we want to be all beauty like the soul, we also have to be aware of God's Presence at every second of our life. You want to identify yourself with your soul's beauty. That is an excellent idea, an excellent aspiration. If you can become fully aware of God's operation in and through you at every second of your life, then you will be identifying yourself with infinite Beauty. God is infinitely more beautiful than your soul or my soul or any individual soul. If you can have a free access to the infinite Beauty which is God, automatically you become one with the soul's beauty, because the soul is an infinitesimal fraction of the Beauty that God embodies. If you go to the Source, you get everything to your heart's content. If you want to be one with the soul's beauty, then think of perfect Beauty, God. Then if God wants, He can give you all His Beauty, or He can give you what you actually want — the identification with your soul's beauty.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, is ugliness a quality in itself, or is it just a lack of beauty?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, is ugliness a quality in itself, or is it just a lack of beauty?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is both. Ugliness is a quality and it is also a lack of beauty As a quality, ugliness comes from our life of irresponsibility. We do not fulfil the divine duty within us. If there is something that we have to do and if we do not do it on time, immediately this lack of duty creates a kind of disharmony in our physical life, our vital life and our inner life. When there is lack of harmony in us, immediately we see chaos, and chaos itself is ugliness.Lack of beauty comes when we do not aspire to become good and self-giving. Even if we become great, that does not necessarily mean that we are aspiring for divine beauty. Greatness and goodness can be separated. When we want to become good, we aspire. When we want to become great, we also aspire, but in this aspiration we use unfortunately our desire-weapon. This desire-weapon first fulfils us and afterwards kills us. We have a knife and, for some time, we use it carefully. But there comes a time when we don't use it carefully. Since we feel that we know how to use it, we become negligent; that is when the desire-knife stabs us. But our aspiration-weapon is not actually a knife. It is more like a flower within us. In the beginning we see that this aspiration-flower is like a bud. Then gradually, gradually we see one petal open, then two, then three, then four. Each petal takes a long time to blossom, but once the flower is fully blossomed we get the sublime fragrance. At that time, even if we remove the flower, the fragrance remains. And when this fragrance permeates our whole body, we become all-beautiful.</p>
