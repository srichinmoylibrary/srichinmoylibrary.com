  <h2 id="page-title">The Businessman Finds Happiness In Smiles</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Businessman Finds Happiness In Smiles" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A businessman was very, very rich. Unlike other rich men, he was very kindhearted. Always he was giving away money, offering charity, helping his friends and serving others through many self-giving deeds. Compared to other businessmen, this man was a real exception. He kept next to nothing of his own money for his own needs. Whatever extra he earned through his business, he gave away.</p>
<p>The man's business was really prospering. One day, a friend of the businessman asked him, "Can you not keep a little more money for yourself?"</p>
<p>The businessman replied, "That I cannot do. Whatever little I need, I take. The other money that I have earned, I am giving away, because I do not need any extra. I want people to be happy. There are so many people who are very, very poor. When I have money and I spend it, I do get joy. But when others are using my money and getting joy, I get so much more joy.</p>
<p>"When I walk along the street in the morning, if I see all sad faces, then I feel miserable. Instead, now I am seeing that these people are becoming happy with my money. I am seeing so many smiling faces. Along Eternity's Road, if I can make people happy, then I am the happiest person. My happiness does not depend on money. It is only in giving and in becoming one with others' joy. Happiness for me is to see another person's smiling face and satisfied heart."</p>
<p>This businessman learned that he could be very, very happy by making others happy. He was a businessman, but he was also a deeply spiritual man. He was doing his business and depending fully on God's Grace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Priest Sees Jesus Christ Inside The Crazy Lady</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Priest Sees Jesus Christ Inside The Crazy Lady" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At the railway station there were many, many people. One elderly lady was screaming at the priest at the top of her lungs, "Father, stop here! Answer my questions! You always talk and talk about God. Have you found God yourself? Have you seen God? We simple people do not talk about God. We do not say anything about knowing God or seeing God. When we commit sins, we tell you people all about them. Do you tell your sins to someone?"</p>
<p>The priest said, "Yes, we also confess."</p>
<p>The old lady replied, "When we commit sins and confess, we tell you people and we mean it. We are very sincere, simple people. When you confess your sins, it is not sincere. You feel that you are always right. You are absolutely perfect!"</p>
<p>The priest said, "All right! Tell me this. When people miss something or lose something, they try to find it. Do you not miss God? Do you not have to find God? In my case, Christ is not missing at all, so I do not have to find Him."</p>
<p>The lady said, "Prove that you have found God!"</p>
<p>"I can see God, but you are blind! Inside your heart, I can see the living Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Very surprised, the lady asked, "You see the living Jesus Christ in me?"</p>
<p>The priest replied, "Yes! Now am I seeing you as the Christ Himself. For me, you are the Christ."</p>
<p>Suddenly the lady became very calm and quiet. The priest added, "When we lose something, we try to find it. In my case, I do not have to look for God, because I find Him everywhere. In you, I see so much Light. Now you have become my destination, because for me you are the Christ.</p>
<p>"Again, I must reach a new destination. I am going now. Please allow me to enter into the train, and then I can arrive at my new destination."</p>
<p>The crazy lady was pleased that the priest saw her as Jesus Christ, so she allowed him to continue to his next destination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Happiness In Working Together</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Happiness In Working Together" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Two scientists were extremely good friends. They would always work together to discover something new. One particular day, one of the scientists was absent, and so the other scientist was working alone. On that day he discovered something very great. He was overjoyed!</p>
<p>The following day, the man who had made the discovery said to his friend, "Look, look, what I have discovered! I have discovered something that will burn away everything. As soon as you touch it, it will burn continuously."</p>
<p>The second scientist was very upset and very jealous. On the one day that he was sick and did not come to work, the other scientist had to discover something so great all by himself! The second one said, "I am so happy that you have found this." But in his heart of hearts, he was full of jealousy.</p>
<p>After some time, the same scientist said, "I am so happy. But can you answer one question for me? Where will you keep your discovery? It burns away everything. If we keep it inside something, will it not burn away the container? Where will we keep it?"</p>
<p>The other scientist got upset. "What are you saying?" he asked.</p>
<p>The jealous friend said, "You are so happy because you have discovered something all by yourself. I am now very unhappy and very miserable that you have discovered it all by yourself. You could have waited just one day for me. Now you have increased my jealousy like anything!"</p>
<p>The other man said, "But we are friends! We are one! I would have been happy if you had discovered the same thing all by yourself."</p>
<p>The jealous colleague said, "I am not so sure of that! In the future, I want us to do everything together. If you do something all by yourself, I will feel jealous and then I will find fault with you. With your new discovery, for example, you must find a container where we will be able to keep it; otherwise it will burn away everything.</p>
<p>"Because we have been working together for years, always we have to work together. Otherwise, I will feel miserable, because you will be known as the inventor and I will not be known at all. Let us work together and discover everything together. Then we shall both be happy."</p>

<p>Two cyclists were riding together. They had been together for several hours and had covered a very long distance. Both of them were enjoying nature's beauty.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, one of them said, "How I wish one of us would stop cycling so that we could know which one of us is the better cyclist."</p>
<p>The other one said, "What? We are lifelong friends. We have been cycling together for so many years. When you go ahead, I catch up with you. When I am ahead, you catch up with me. We are getting such joy always riding together. At that time, we talk about all kinds of things — nature's beauty, friends, enemies and more."</p>
<p>The second cyclist said, "Is that what our friendship is? I am stopping cycling. You go on. Just see how much you will enjoy yourself! There will be nobody to talk with you, nobody to watch you and nobody to appreciate you. Go ahead on your own, and then you can boast that you are the better cyclist. Unfortunately, nobody will be there to appreciate you."</p>
<p>The first cyclist felt miserable. He said, "You are right. My friend, please come with me. Let us go together."</p>
<p>The friend replied, "No, no! You want to separate yourself from me to see if you are the better cyclist. Go right ahead! Again, I am telling you that alone you will never find the joy that we get when we go together. In togetherness, there is always joy. But I can stop easily right now so that you can find out who is better."</p>
<p>The first friend begged and begged, "Please, let us go together. In comparison and competition there is no joy. The only joy is in oneness. Let us cycle together and we will talk about everything. Now I know that inspiration, joy and encouragement come only when we share with others. I am pleading with you, let us continue together."</p>
<p>The second cyclist agreed wholeheartedly. "From now on, we shall always cycle together. We shall arrive together at our destination."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Balzac Laughs At The Thief</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Balzac Laughs At The Thief" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One night Balzac was sleeping in his room. Very quietly, on tiptoe, a thief entered into Balzac's room. The room was extremely small. There was a simple bed. Beside the bed, there was a desk, where Balzac used to write his novels.</p>
<p>The thief thought that since Balzac was so famous, he would have lots of money. He was looking here, there and everywhere, but he was not finding any money. The thief came to Balzac's desk, and he was so surprised that there was no money on the desk. Without making a sound, the thief opened up the desk drawer. Balzac was actually not sleeping, he was observing. He wanted to see what the thief was going to steal. When the thief opened up the drawer, Balzac burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Astonished, the thief asked, "Why are you laughing, instead of chasing me and grabbing me?"</p>
<p>Balzac answered, "I am laughing because you are looking for money here. You have taken such risk! You might well be caught and then you would be put into jail. You took so much risk to get my money during the night. It is so dark now. But I must tell you that I cannot find any money here even during the day!"</p>
<p>The thief said, "Please, please, forgive me!"</p>
<p>Balzac said, "All right, I forgive you. You have to find someone who is really rich, and I do hope you will be successful."</p>

<p>When Balzac was a young novelist and just becoming famous, a publisher wanted to publish his latest novel. The publisher was carrying with him 3000 francs to offer to Balzac as payment. When he came to Balzac's neighbourhood, he saw that the novelist was living in a very poor area. The publisher then said to himself, "I can easily give him only 2000 francs."</p>
<p>As the publisher came close to Balzac's place, he said, "Balzac is living in a tiny, dark place. I will be able to give him 1000 francs. Since he is so poor, I am sure he will be more than satisfied."</p>
<p>When the publisher entered into the room, he saw that Balzac was very, very simple. He thought, "I am certain he will accept if I offer him only 300 francs." The publisher was right. He bought Balzac's latest manuscript for only 300 francs!</p>
<p>That book, <em>La Dernière Fée</em>, became extremely famous. The publisher was such a rogue! He was carrying 3000 francs with him. But when he saw that Balzac was living in a very poor area, and in a tiny apartment that was simpler than the simplest, he brought the price down ten-fold. He bought <em>La Dernière Fée</em> for 300 francs!</p>

<p>Balzac lived a very, very simple life. He had almost an austere life. Always he was wearing the same white robe, the same shoes and the same old belt. He never, never wore anything new.</p>
<p>One day a friend asked him, "How is it that you are living such an austere life? You are earning enough money. Why do you not buy some new clothes?"</p>
<p>Balzac replied, "When do I have time to buy new clothes? I want to defeat God. God created for six days, and then He took rest. In my case, I do not want to take any rest. I want to work seven days a week, every hour and every minute. This is the only way that I can create more than God does. If I spend my time buying this and that, then my creation will suffer. The best thing for me is to create non-stop and defeat God. I do not have to wear new clothes or even nice clothes. My joy is in my creation."</p>

<p>The man said, "My name is David."</p>

<p>The Master asked a particular disciple, "Why do you enjoy gossip? It is such a dangerous thing. Gossip shows no respect for anybody. It weakens and ruins others' strength. When people gossip and find faults with others, they become such rogues. Again, when people become victims to gossip, they become helpless and hopeless. In every way, gossip is a very subtle, contagious and dangerous disease. Please tell me, why do you enjoy gossip?"</p>
<p>"I get joy from gossiping," answered the disciple.</p>
<p>The Master replied, "If you enjoy gossip at the cost of others' suffering, then what kind of disciple are you? Do you not see how you are making others' lives miserable by gossiping? The time you spend gossiping, can you not spend that time praying and meditating?"</p>
<p>"But I do not get any joy in prayer and meditation; whereas in gossip, I get tremendous joy. Master, you always say to keep innocent joy in our lives. After all, I am not killing anybody."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are not killing anybody. But you are getting only malicious pleasure. This pleasure is not real joy. Anything that you do when you are kind to people, when you are sympathetic to others, or when you serve people, will give you real joy. But when you gossip, you are really hurting people. There is very little and often no truth behind gossip. You are creating something false and absurd.</p>
<p>"Now I am telling you. If you want real joy — not the false joy which gossip gives — and if you have nothing else to do, just read, run, sing or even rest. There are so many good things that you can do.</p>
<p>"In every way, gossip weakens humanity. The best thing is to strengthen humanity. Since you are in the spiritual life, you have to strengthen humanity at every moment with your love for truth and with your concern for reality and divinity. Please do not enjoy gossip. When you gossip, world-destruction and self-destruction proudly march forward. Hand in hand they go together."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Can God Please Everybody?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Can God Please Everybody?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A school teacher asked his students a simple question. "Can God please everybody?"</p>
<p>One student stood up and said, "Since God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent, He definitely can please everybody — unlike us." All the students except one enthusiastically agreed and added their own views to support this.</p>
<p>Only one naughty student stood up and said, "No, God definitely cannot please everybody."</p>
<p>The teacher asked, "How can you say this so confidently?"</p>
<p>The student said, "This is all coming from my own experience."</p>
<p>"Your own experience?"</p>
<p>"Yes, year after year, I am praying to God for something, and He is not fulfilling my desire. My parents also have many desires, as do my sisters and brothers. As their desires are not being fulfilled, how can you say that God can please everybody?"</p>
<p>The other students said, "God certainly can please everybody if He wants to. He has this capacity."</p>
<p>The bad boy replied, "If God has the capacity, let Him use it. Let Him please my sisters, my brothers and my parents. Let Him please me. Then I will say that not only does God have the capacity, but He also uses it. Now you are imagining that God has the capacity. I do not want to remain in the world of imagination. He should show me. God should make me happy, plus my parents, my brothers, my sisters, my acquaintances and all those that I know. Since they are not all happy, then I must say that God cannot please everybody."</p>
<p>The students had a wonderful fight. All of them, except this one boy, said that they had learnt from their parents that God can please everybody. The children wanted to beat the boy up.</p>
<p>The poor teacher said, "Please, please, do not fight! I am the one to be blamed. I am the problem-maker. I asked you, 'Can God please everybody?' This one boy says, 'God cannot.' You say, 'He can.' I am lost between your group and this young fellow.</p>
<p>"I am withdrawing my question. God alone knows whether He has the capacity to please everybody or whether He actually pleases everybody. We do not know. Our faith tells us that God has the capacity, which is absolutely true. But somebody can come along to challenge us, saying that we have to prove that God can please everybody. 'Has God pleased all of your desires? Has God pleased his desires?' This is the boy's argument. He says, 'No!'</p>
<p>"The best thing is to feel that it is all my fault. I brought up this question and now I withdraw it. It is up to you whether or not to believe that God can please everybody and do everything."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Height Of Ingratitude</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Height Of Ingratitude" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is a story about ingratitude narrated by Winston Churchill. A little boy was playing on a pier. All of a sudden he fell off the pier into the water. He did not know how to swim and was in serious danger of drowning. A very kind-hearted young soldier saw this, and he immediately jumped off the pier and swam towards the little boy. He put the boy on his shoulders and brought him back up to the pier quite safely. This young man saved the boy's life.</p>
<p>The boy had been playing with other little boys, but his parents were nowhere to be found. The soldier drove the child to his parents' home and left the boy there. The young man did not even think of receiving any reward. He was a very kind-hearted person, and he was extremely happy that he was able to save the life of this little boy.</p>
<p>A few days later, the boy's parents came to look for the soldier. Everybody was helping them look for him, because they thought that the parents had come to give him a reward for saving their child. Finally they found the soldier working at the pier.</p>
<p>The parents approached the young man, and he immediately said, "You have to come to me? Please, please, I do not need any reward. I am so happy that I was able to save your child's life. That is my greatest reward. You do not have to give me anything."</p>
<p>The father and mother said, "No! We have not come here to give you anything. We have come to ask you for our son's hat. Where is it?"</p>
<p>The young man was shocked. He said, "I tried to save your son's life and I did save his life. Now you are asking me for his hat?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the parents.</p>
<p>How powerful ingratitude can be! The young man had saved the life of the parent's only child, and they were asking for his hat! Instead of giving the soldier a reward or even a simple 'Thank you,' they were asking for the boy's hat!</p>
<p>They demanded, "What did you do with our son's hat? What is wrong with you? We want to know where the hat is!"</p>
<p>This is the height of ingratitude.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Why Did My Son Get Killed?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Why Did My Son Get Killed?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A father received the message that his son, who was a soldier, was killed in battle. The father became absolutely insane with grief. Everywhere people were trying to console him, but nobody could console him. The father said, "My son was such a nice boy. He was very brilliant, very strong and very handsome. This is what has happened to him in the army! I hate the army! Why do they fight against other countries?" The father was cursing the country, the army and everything else.</p>
<p>Then the father went to a priest for consolation. He told the priest, "I am so miserable. I have lost my only son. Please, please tell me how I can get consolation."</p>
<p>The priest said, "What can I do? I am willing to do what you wish, but please tell me what you actually want from me."</p>
<p>The father said, "Consolation."</p>
<p>"I can only pray to God to console you. This is what we priests do. When somebody dies, we try to console the dear ones with our prayer."</p>
<p>"I know," replied the father. "But can you tell me one thing?"</p>
<p>The priest said, "What is it?"</p>
<p>"When my son died, what was our Heavenly Father doing? Where was He? Can you imagine? My son was in the army serving his country. He was a military man and he was killed. What was God doing? My son was doing something great and good for his country, and God did not save him. I am asking you, what did God do?"</p>
<p>The priest answered, "I know what God did. I am getting the message from your heart. Your own heart is telling me that God was right beside your son when he was killed."</p>
<p>The man was so puzzled. "God was beside my son? Then why did my son have to die? Why did God not protect my son? What kind of stupid thing are you telling me, Father? If God was beside my son, then God could easily have saved my son."</p>
<p>"Yes, God could have saved your son. When we sincerely ask God to fulfil our desires, we feel that He will automatically fulfil them. But beyond our sincerity, there is something called God's Need and God's Will. We do not always know what they are."</p>
<p>The man asked, "Now what can I do?"</p>
<p>The priest replied, "Why? Your son has died as a soldier. Do you know that in his next incarnation your son will become a commander general?"</p>
<p>"Commander, my son will become a commander?" asked the man.</p>
<p>"Yes, we all make progress. God wanted him to die a hero. You are feeling a great loss, but your son died heroically. Your own heart is telling me that in his next incarnation, your son will become a commander."</p>
<p>"My son will be a commander? My son will be a commander?" the man asked. He started crying at one moment, then smiling at the next moment. The man was practically going crazy.</p>
<p>The priest said, "Please do not act like this. I tell you, whatever God does is for our good. Our haughty mind will not accept that, but our inner heart will. My oneness with your heart and with your son's heart is so strong that I am getting the inner message that God will make him a military general in his next incarnation.</p>
<p>"Outwardly you are now crying and crying. But when I think of your heart, your heart tells me that your son will become someone very great and you are so happy to hear that. Always look forward; always look upward. If something bad or sad happens, try to feel that something better is coming; something more illumining and more fulfilling is coming. Please try to see today's loss as part of a supreme Game. Tomorrow God will expedite our progress. Today's death does not mean that your son is gone forever. No. Today's death is only a preparation for tomorrow's birth. With tomorrow's birth, your son will transcend himself and become both great and good."</p>
<p>This is how the priest consoled the father. Indeed, the man was deeply consoled. He fell at the feet of the priest. "Father, now you have illumined me. I thank you with all my heart. I am all yours."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Meaning Of The Master&#039;s Stories</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Meaning Of The Master&#039;s Stories" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A disciple once made a serious complaint to the Master. He said, "Master, you always tell stories that give us joy. But will we not get more joy if we know the meaning of the stories that you tell us? We do not always understand what they actually mean. If we understand, then I feel we will be happier, and also you will be happy that we have understood you."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You fool! When I tell you stories, you want me to tell you the meaning? It is as if you are asking me to give you a mango. Then, just as you are about to eat the mango, you want me to take it back and start eating it for you. When I tell you a story, you have to be one with the story. Please try to be part and parcel of the story. Then you will be able to get its real meaning and significance.</p>
<p>"Otherwise, if I also tell you the significance of the story, if I do everything, it is as if I am chewing and eating for you. But if you swallow something without even chewing it, how will you get the taste? Only from chewing and eating will you be able to grasp the meaning.</p>
<p>"My job is to tell you a story. Your job is to dive deep within and understand the meaning. Otherwise, you will remain spiritually hungry. If you play your role and search for the meaning of the story yourself, then you will get real joy, absolute joy."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">New Adventures In Old Age</h2><span property="dc:title" content="New Adventures In Old Age" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Old age is no obstacle. Churchill embarked on painting at a very old age. There are many, many world-famous people who became great in their old age. Even Tagore started painting just a few years before he passed away. Previously, he was all the time writing books. Only at the end of his life, he became an artist. At what point people can bloom, we do not know. That is why we say "late bloomers"!</p>
<p>Then again, when we become old, we will get new joy, new inspiration and new delight if we can continue with the good things that we have been doing for years. We may do the same thing every day, but there will be new joy awaiting us every day with our continued practice.</p>
<p>For example, when Pablo Casals was 95 years old, he was still practising his cello every day. He felt just the same as always. Once someone asked him, "Why do you practise at your age? You have become the greatest cellist. Now you can rest!"</p>
<p>Casals answered, "You want me to rest? You do not want me to make any progress? Every day I am playing the cello and I have been playing for years and years, ever since my childhood. Every day I feel I have made some progress."</p>
<p>When inspiration comes, we must pay no attention to age — whether we are eight or eighty. We also have to continue as long as we live on earth with the good things that we have been doing. Since Pablo Casals played the cello regularly, every day for him was like a new dawn, a new sunrise.</p>
<p>New creative life can start at any age. There is no age limit. But if you want to continue, if you want to make progress and get ever more joy from your creativity, then you have to practise regularly and punctually.</p>

<p>An old lady said to a priest, "Father, today you did not read out your sermon."</p>
<p>The priest said, "I did not read it out, because the sermon that I was supposed to give today I have already given many times."</p>
<p>The old lady said, "When you give something many, many times, do you get any joy? Where is the newness? Every day, if you see a fresh flower, you get such joy. But if you see an old, dry flower, do you get any joy? If you are sincere in your heart, you will see that you do not get any joy from giving your old sermons — and we definitely do not get joy!!! Please use your wisdom and give us new sermons. Then you will get joy and we shall get joy. Always in newness, like in the freshness of a flower, we get tremendous joy."</p>
<p>The priest said, "You are right, absolutely right. I thank you from the very depths of my heart for your most illumining sermon. I love you, dear."</p>
