  <h2 id="page-title">A meeting with Paul Richard</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A meeting with Paul Richard" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a colleague of mine asked me if I would like to meet the great French savant Paul Richard, the husband of the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. I could not believe that he was still alive. I was under the impression that he had passed away many years ago.</p>
<p>On 29 April 1967 I went with my friend to an apartment on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, and there I had a three-hour interview with Paul Richard. He was so nice to me, so affectionate, so compassionate.</p>
<p>In his room, he kept a small picture of Sri Aurobindo. He told me that Sri Aurobindo always used to call him “Brother,” and he also used to call Sri Aurobindo “Brother.” He had such love and respect for Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>He served the French Government. I believe that he was the French Consul in Algeria at one time. In 1910 he came to see Sri Aurobindo for the first time. In 1914 both he and his wife visited Sri Aurobindo. Then after four or five years, she came back alone.</p>
<p>In his later years, Paul Richard came to America to be with his sons, who were teaching here at a university.</p>
<p>He showed me a window in his room and said, “I vividly saw my Brother standing here.” One day before Sri Aurobindo passed on in 1950, he appeared to Paul Richard to bless him.</p>
<p>After the interview, I wrote everything down in Bengali. It filled thirty pages. Later I sent a photograph of our meeting to my family in the Ashram. When Paul Richard died not long afterwards, I wrote directly to the Mother to inform her.</p>
<p>He was an excellent writer. He wrote many books on India, and quite a few articles appeared in India appreciating his writings.</p>

<p>During our marathon interview, Paul Richard said to me:</p>
<p>“I see Nolini more as a divine warrior than as a great thinker. He is my Brother’s (Sri Aurobindo’s) earthly shield and Heavenly sword. His mind is illumined, his life is liberated. I admire Nolini.”</p>
<p>Nolini-da was my immediate boss at the Ashram.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Getting a green card</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Getting a green card" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It took me three years to get a green card. Dulal, Madhuri and Sudha were helping me. Then one disciple in the Puerto Rico Centre came forward unexpectedly. Her name was Rose. I gave her the name Mukti. One evening we had a meeting at the Centre and she was very, very moved by the meditation. Afterwards, she came up to me and said, “My brother, Sol, is an assistant in the Immigration Office in New York. If I can be of any help to you, please let me know.”</p>
<p>She telephoned her brother, and I went to see him when I returned to New York. She had told me that her brother would do anything for her. I was only a junior clerk, but the way he treated me was so nice. His name was Sol Mark. And Dulal’s name was Sol Montlack. He helped me to fill out all the forms and with so many other things that I had to do. Previously, the authorities had written to me that I had to get a letter from the Sri Aurobindo Ashram saying that I was qualified to teach people. I said to Sol, “I will not be able to ask them because I came here against their will.” So he smiled and cancelled that part. He himself answered many of the questions on my behalf. His last question was, “So, when are you planning to go to Russia or China?” I said, “I am not planning to go.” Then he gave me a broad smile. Later I found out that the American immigration authorities do not allow people with green cards to go to Russia or China.</p>
<p>Usually people have to go to the Immigration Office at least three times, but I went there only once. At the end of the interview, Sol Mark told me to continue working at the Consulate for two or three more months, not to take any risk. I worked up until the middle of June 1967 and then I gave up my job and went to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>From Puerto Rico I wanted to go to Jamaica, West Indies, but I could not go without the green card. So I telephoned Sol Mark from Puerto Rico. He said, “When do you want to go to Jamaica?” I told him the date. He replied, “I will get it.” Then the conversation was over.</p>
<p>I thought that I might hear from him again in ten or eleven days, but in just two days the green card came in the mail. On the outside of the envelope was his name. He looked like Ashrita’s father. Usually he was very strict, but because of his sister he was so nice to me. This is how sisters and brothers make demands.</p>
<p>On the day that he promised me the card, I did something for his soul. And when I came back from Jamaica, how much I did for his soul! As soon as I received the card, I sent him a tie. Then at Christmas I gave him a beautiful present. He wrote me a thank-you note saying that he was so happy he could help me. He later became head of his department. Now he is retired and living in the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>His sister, Rose, was our disciple for three years and then she went to live in Florida. Her husband was also very nice to me, although he did not become a disciple. We went to eat at their place in Puerto Rico several times. Once the husband was telling us that Sol was very bad. Meanwhile, Rose was defending her brother. For one hour, X, Sudha and I enjoyed their fight. The food was ready, but we could not eat until their fight was over!</p>
<p>I am so grateful to Rose. She was the one who saved me, the main instrument in getting the green card. Without it, I could not have lived in America for the past thirty-three years.</p>

<h2>New Year's Message for the year 1966</h2>

<p>May humanity climb up one rung in the ladder of divine growth, and realise in its soul the Sweetness, Joy, Light and Peace of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Out of the pure fulness of the heart, may the lips of Truth speak and the hands of Truth act in the year 1966.</p>
<p>The New Year — what can it teach us? It can teach us the secret of spiritual self-reliance. It can teach us how we ourselves can be our Masters and Saviours.</p>
<p>From the New Year we can learn that God is God only when God is OUR God and not MY God. From the New Year we can learn that Truth is Truth only when Truth is OUR Truth and not MY Truth.</p>
<p>At every moment it is we who can make ourselves a blessing to ourselves and to the world at large.</p>
<p>May the universal embrace of the New Year flower into a permanent smile of Victory on the Face of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Mr. S. K. Roy:</em> Consul General of India. He was a former Major in the Indian army. When he was transferred back to India, Chinmoy wrote a poem for him and recited it at the Consul General’s farewell party. He was known as a warm and compassionate official.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy came to New York on 13 April 1964. From June that year until June 1967, he worked as a Junior Consular Assistant in the Passport and Visa Section of the Indian Consulate General in New York City.</em></p>
<p><em>Although almost three decades have now passed by, Sri Chinmoy has often enchanted his disciples with his extremely sweet and vivid memories of those years. He recently said, “In those days I was poverty-stricken, but my heart was full of joy. In those days I used to play in the hope-garden; my heart of hope was blossoming.”</em></p>
<p><em>This volume presents some of Sri Chinmoy’s recollections about his colleagues, friends, early apartments and subway experiences.</em></p>
