 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Can we learn much about occultism from reading books?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many of my disciples are studying books that deal with occultism. I am fully aware of it. But my honest request to you is that you do not study books on occultism if they are not written by spiritual Masters or realised souls. Most of the books written on occultism are collections of fanciful ideas which have nothing to do with reality. Then, by merely studying books on occultism, one can never acquire even an iota of occult force. Books can never give the real secret of occultism. One develops occult powers by going deep within and by enlarging one's consciousness. Or, if one has an earnest, sincere cry to bring these hidden forces to the fore and use them only for the sake of the Divine, then one can develop occult power.</p>
<p>One can also learn occultism from spiritual Masters who have both occult power and spiritual power. If one wants to practise occultism in order to serve humanity or awaken the consciousness of humanity, then he has to first conquer fear. He has to conquer all kinds of fear on the physical, vital, mental and psychic planes. Also, if occultism is to be practised to serve the Supreme, the Divine in humanity, one has to conquer the lower vital or sex-force. You can call it the impure, unlit urge in our human nature. These forces have to be totally conquered. Then, one has to feel that one is living the eternal life in the fleeting life. If one can have the realisation that one is living the eternal life in the fleeting life, then the Infinity, Eternity and Immortality that he has achieved in his own inner being or consciousness can be utilised to serve humanity in the Supreme's own Way. At that time, occultism is not a curse; it is a blessing.</p>
<p>I wish my dedicated disciples who are interested in occultism to bear in mind that first comes spirituality, then occultism; first Divinity, then humanity. Divinity is not outside humanity; Divinity is inside humanity. But unless and until we know Divinity, we cannot serve humanity. We have to remain within Divinity, and then only can we serve humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Real spiritual Masters do not use occultism to play a role in outer human society. The highest occultism will only be used in the inner world to help sincere seekers and to help mankind. In my own personal opinion, occultism has to be seen as something very sacred and precious. It has to be reserved for aspiring humanity, because if it enters into the social and political life and so forth, there it will immediately lose its purity and serenity. Then it will not be of any spiritual service to mankind. Spiritual occultism, pure occultism, to which I am referring, has to be used only for aspiring humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can take material shape. Sometimes occult power looks like a sharp arrow; like a bullet it can go. While occult power is performing, it can take any form it wants to, but it does not have to take outer form. Occult power or spiritual power doesn't always have to be in a form for you to recognise it. It is like consciousness. Consciousness can be very solid and tangible. You can touch it, eat it, feel it. Again, it can be very flat like water.</p>
<p>A lump of sugar can take any form: it can look like a mountain or it can be very flat, but still it is sugar. Sri Ramakrishna used to say that ice and water are the same thing. If you see ice, it is a reality; if you see water, it is also a reality. There are only two forms that you can see. But occult power can be seen in an invisible form.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the strict spiritual point of view, developing occult powers is not necessary. God is the only Reality we need. It is up to Him to give us any power, be it physical, mental or psychic power. If it is His Will, He will grant us power when we are destined to do something for Him in His own Way. Let us pray to God to give us Light. Otherwise, any powers we get on the occult plane may create problems for us. If we pray and meditate only for Light, then when Light descends it will illumine our consciousness. At that time if God wants us to develop some spiritual power to be of greater help to mankind, naturally He will grant it to us. The secret of the highest Truth is this: Do not long for anything except God the Supreme Light. We must feel in the inmost recesses of our hearts that it is the Light Supreme that we need to change our natures, to please God, to fulfil God, to serve God in mankind and to serve suffering mankind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you tell us what mysticism entails?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you tell us what mysticism entails?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three major paths, or roads, of spirituality: <em>Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga. Jnana</em> is the path of knowledge or wisdom. Within <em>Jnana Yoga</em> there is a special branch called <em>Raja Yoga</em> or the <em>Royal Road</em>, on which one runs the fastest. You can call it a short cut. It deals with tremendous aspiration, eagerness and constant dedication. A mystic follows the path of <em>Raja Yoga</em>.</p>
<p>A mystic is not someone who is vague, or who lives in the moon-world, even though, unfortunately, people identify a mystic as such. A mystic is a seeker who, with dynamic energy, wants to discover the Truth in the fastest way, through intuition-power. Using the third eye, he will see the Truth faster than anything, faster than a bullet. But if an individual wants to have that kind of weapon, then naturally he has to give up everything that is undivine in him. Everything that is divine, he will accept and try to cultivate in his life.</p>
<p>A mystic is he who wants to see the Truth as soon as possible in the most illumining and fulfilling way. A mystic is not someone who spurns everything practical. But here in the West and in India also, people do not pay attention to the mystic. They simply say, "He is not practical. He cares only for God; he does not care for the world. He is only looking at the sun, looking at the moon, looking at the hills. He is not for this world." But a real mystic is he who wants to see the divine mystery in everything, in nature and in human beings.</p>
<p>He wants to go to the essence, to the Source, faster than any human being dares to imagine. This is a real mystic.</p>

<h2>Question: Does God like magic?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God likes magic very much because He is the Divine Magician. Every second He is doing something, only we don't see it. God is the Supreme Magician. When we use our outer eye we don't see His Magic, but when we use our inner eye we see His Magic all the time. Again, it is one thing to use our inner vision and another thing to become one with His Transcendental Vision. At that time we don't call it magic at all, but a necessary and inevitable experience.</p>
<p>The outer being has no inner vision; it is blind. That is why we can't see God's Magic at all. Millions and billions of things He is doing at every moment. But these human eyes are useless. Again, the inner vision sees everything. Inner vision does not necessarily mean inner oneness, inseparable oneness. You can see a painting with your eye, but you may not become one with it. Similarly, you may see God's Magic with your inner vision, but you may not become one with it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker on the spiritual path who aspires for real spirituality would never, never indulge in this kind of thing. To go to a medium to find out what is happening in Heaven, on earth, or in the vital world is not spirituality at all. Spirituality means the constant aspiration to be totally unified with God. Spirituality means one's natural oneness with God. In today's world, God has become unnatural. To the human beings who are bundles of ignorance, God has become something abnormal and unnatural. But for those who are following the path of real spirituality, God is absolutely normal and natural.</p>
<p>So if somebody is interested in automatic writing, mediums and trances, you have to try to kindle the flame of aspiration in him. He may not listen to you, but if he is very near and dear to you, try to show him that automatic writing is not good. Only concentration, meditation and contemplation can give him abiding satisfaction. But try to make him see that it is he who is discovering the truth and not you who are imposing some truth upon him. When one feels that he has discovered the truth from within, then that truth becomes normal and natural; it becomes a living reality. In that way you will be able to bring him to the right path. So inwardly please try; but not outwardly. Your inner effort will be much more fruitful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Astronomers have this big controversy about whether the universe is infinitely expanding or whether it is limited. Which view is correct?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Astronomers have this big controversy about whether the universe is infinitely expanding or whether it is limited. Which view is correct?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that there are two universes. One is the geographical universe, the other is the consciousness-universe. So if the scientists are referring to the consciousness-universe, I wish to say that it is constantly enlarging itself. But the geographical universe is limited. According to our mental conception, we think of the world, then the universe, then the creation itself. Each is vaster than its predecessor. But we have to know that the things that we can create or conceive of with our mental faculties, or even with our intuitive faculties, are limited. But what is unlimited is the consciousness-universe, which is all the time transcending and enlarging itself.</p>
<p>When we hear that the universe is growing larger, we have to know that it is actually the spiritual universe that is expanding. I always say that the human heart is a very tiny muscle, but the spiritual heart, which is inside me, inside you, inside everyone, houses the Universal Consciousness. That heart houses most perfectly the universe, no matter how much it enlarges itself. The universe is always inside that heart.</p>
<p>One universe we form with our preconceived mental ideas, but it has nothing to do with the soul's reality. The universe that is connected with our soul's reality is constantly enlarging itself and transcending itself. We come into contact with this spiritual universe when we have a major inner experience or realisation. Before that, the inner universe is all mental. We try to imagine it, but even when we use our imagination-power, it is limited. We imagine an infinite expanse of green which goes on and on. We feel that our imagination is endless, but because we are using the mind, in five minutes or ten minutes or five hours, it will come to a halt. It cannot go any farther because it is in the mental world. Then, if we go beyond the mental world into the intuitive world, there again we get a glimpse of the infinite universe, but the vision is only like a tiny flame. The other day I answered a question about intuition. I said it is like a flame, but when the third eye opens up, at that time we see the difference between a flame and the sun. So until the third eye opens up, everything is very tiny. With intuition and imagination, we can know something about the universe, but we cannot change it. Only when the third eye opens up and starts functioning can we burn out all the evil deeds of our past and expedite our future progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What will happen when the physical sun grows so old that it dies? Or what will happen when earth gets very old?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What will happen when the physical sun grows so old that it dies? Or what will happen when earth gets very old?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dearest child, we don't know what is going to happen at the next moment. This star, the sun, is becoming cold, colder, coldest. But before it exhausts all its light, God knows how many thousands of incarnations you will take. Who knows? Long before it stops giving light, you will realise God and at that time you will be able to take care of this star. Now you are afraid that this star will disappear. But if this star really goes away, God is still there. In the twinkling of an eye, He can create another sun-star which will start again as a child and again give light.</p>
<p>God can replace anybody or anything. As I always say, nobody is indispensable and this present sun-star is not indispensable. God is using someone or something; that is why we say that that person or thing is indispensable. Whoever is utilised by God is indispensable. God is everywhere; only He is giving a particular individual or thing the opportunity to manifest Him. When I utilise someone, he is indispensable in my eyes. I will phone a person to ask him to print a book immediately. When I call him, at that time he is indispensable. But the next moment, if I don't want the book to be printed, then I won't give the person the job, and at that time I don't take him as indispensable. When I am painting, my right hand is indispensable because I am using it. But if I don't want to use it, if I want to use my left hand, God will give me the capacity because He is there in my left hand also.</p>
<p>So in God's case also, with a planet or a human being, when God uses something or someone, He feels that that person or thing is indispensable. When somebody on earth is doing some work, God really makes that person feel that he is indispensable because God's Consciousness is on that person. So, God has given the sun the opportunity to offer light. God's creation did not start with this sun-star. His Silence was His creation, His Dream was His creation. Gradually, gradually, all the planets, stars and everything else came into existence. God lives in the Eternal Now. God never thinks. God does not have the mind or the brain, like ordinary people. I tell you frankly, not only does God not use the brain, but He does not have one. You can try to give Him a brain; He will accept it with gratitude. But right now He does not use the mind. He does not calculate anything. God and calculation do not go together. God and mathematics really do not go together. That is why I was a bad student in mathematics.</p>
<p>If you start calculating something, your real joy goes away. When you see some bills scattered, you may think, "Ah, so much money!" Then, when you start counting the one dollar bills, such a heap of money becomes only twenty dollars. Before counting you were so delighted; you felt that you had so much money. But as soon as you heard "twenty," all your inspiration and joy went away.</p>
<p>God is wise; that is why He does not count. Counting means you are binding- binding your treasure, binding your wealth, binding your realisation. God does not want to bind Himself. Therefore, He goes on creating and creating. The moment He calculates, everything is gone; His Joy goes away.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are the influences of the planets significant in our lives?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are the influences of the planets significant in our lives?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the seeker is very sincere, very genuine and very highly developed, then the influence of the planets cannot affect him. Spiritual Masters are not affected at all by the planets. If something happens in a spiritual Master's life, and the planets have indicated its occurrence, it doesn't mean that the planets have brought it about. No, that is coincidence. But in the lives of absolutely ordinary human beings, the planets do play a considerable role.</p>
<p>The planets are like a broken record. They go on and on playing the same music. But there is a world infinitely higher than the planets. From there we can easily create and we can also delete anything in the record. If we delete what is there, then we can add something new. Your fate can also be adjusted by the Grace of the Supreme. If a seeker is very highly developed and gets considerable Grace, either from God or from a great spiritual Master, then the planets cannot influence that seeker. Even if one is an ordinary seeker, if the Master intervenes, then the planets cannot do anything.</p>
<p>I have done this many times for the most ordinary, unaspiring disciples. It was the Will of the Supreme; that was why I had to do it. If it had not been His Will, I would not have done it at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do the planets and stars have a lower vital?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do the planets and stars have a lower vital?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All the planets and stars have a vital-consciousness, and it is often connected with the lower vital, not the dynamic vital. The moon has a tremendous undivine vital-consciousness which often creates problems for spiritual seekers. It allows celestial beings to destroy the meditation of the spiritual Masters. When they are about to reach the Highest, when they are about to enter into <em>samadhi</em> and the Beyond, at that time the hostile forces go and plead with the celestial nymphs to go to the spiritual Masters and dance. These most beautiful beings come to tempt the Masters and stop them from reaching the Highest. The moon allows these beautiful nymphs to dance in such an undivine way, and very often the Masters fall. This temptation has ruined them. The planets and the stars can do the same thing.</p>
