<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only by mixing and being in the company of spiritual people. Each spiritual person, if he is sincere, is a tremendous inspiration to the rest of the world. So if you have fear or doubt, although there are many ways to remove them, you can easily look for another spiritual person. If that person does not have fear, just talk to him; if the person does not have doubt, talk to him. At that time you gain the strength that he has. A seeker, a sincere seeker, is more than ready to give you his strength and faith.</p>
<p>When doubt appears, if it is not overcome and then on the strength of your doubt you start mixing with people who have left the spiritual path, you yourself will be overcome by doubt. Try to mix with people who have not left the boat. They will lift you up and inspire you, whereas those who have left will say, “I have another boat. Come, come with me.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a lesson to be learned when someone deceives us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a lesson to be learned when someone deceives us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that the life of one who deceives you and your own life are totally different. If somebody brings a snake right in front of you, will you just stay there and say, “Oh, God is here!”? God is in the snake, true. Still one can’t stay in front of a snake and not be bitten. When you were of the standard of the snake, you could have stood in front of the snake and not been bitten. But now you have surpassed the snake. You no longer have the standard of a snake, so you have to be very careful.</p>
<p>God is everywhere, but you have to know your standard. If God is in everybody, then why come to the meditation hall? At this time you could have gone to a bar. God is also inside the people who are drinking there. But you don’t go there because you know that in comparison this is a better place. So you have to be very wise. Birds of a feather flock together. Now you have entered into the spiritual life. Our standard is much higher, infinitely higher, than those people, so you cannot mix with them. At the same time you should not hate them. It is just that you cannot treasure some of the qualities they have. God is having a particular experience inside them, and God is telling us not to have that same experience.</p>
<p>We can learn from others’ deception, and we can learn from our own diligence. When we are alert, we learn a few things, and when we are not alert, we learn a few other things. When we are alert, we don’t learn anything from our failures, or so-called trouble. When we are alert and very diligent, we go from light to more light. But when you mix with people who are not aspiring consciously and deliberately, then you enter into ignorance. We are in darkness, and from darkness we try to come to light. From light we can go to more light and abundant light. When we mix with spiritual people, we go from light to higher light. So in the future, only mix with other spiritual seekers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you want you can become provided you become more sincere. I don’t question your sincerity. You say it is your sincere wish to become a divine warrior. Now sincerity is like a muscle. You are sincere and you should become more sincere. Then what you sincerely want can be accomplished.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do people seem so confident and self-assured?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do people seem so confident and self-assured?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People are confident of everything these days. Even a child knows everything. Two or three hundred years ago, people wouldn’t dare to speak of God. A few hundred years ago most people didn’t know anything about God. Very few had the feeling that some people had realised God. Now all Indian widows are realised; we have to touch their feet. These days in America, people who haven’t even done Hatha Yoga, let alone meditation, talk to their friends as if they know everything about God. They may not have been to any spiritual Master, but they know everything.</p>
<p>As in the Indian villages, people here have a disproportionate confidence. In the past people had faith in their incapacity. They would learn from God. Now the people in the world know everything about God. Often people are insincere. If they tell a lie ten times in a dramatic way, the eleventh time they do not take it as a lie. By the eleventh time, it is the truth. Once they are convinced that they will realise God, they try to give realisation to everybody.</p>
<p>A kind of confidence has entered into the world that is founded upon nothing. We need confidence, but this is false confidence. It is something we have created in order to show off to the world and to other people.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Do accidents ever have a divine purpose?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we look at an accident from the highest spiritual point of view, the highest spiritual consciousness, then it is not an accident at all. It is just an incident, an experience that God is having in and through a particular human being. But in the outer world, in the field of manifestation, very often the dark, wrong, hostile forces cause accidents. Sometimes the Supreme actually disapproves of these accidents. Sometimes the divine tolerance is there and He just tolerates them. And sometimes He approves. This is because at the time of an accident the Supreme feels that a particular person can be inspired to lead a better, more spiritual and more significant life. Someone may be disturbed by circumstances in his life, by members of the family, his neighbours and so forth, so that a new life is needed. The present life may be absolutely useless for that particular person. So you may see that an unfortunate accident will take place. If you look at it with your outer eye, you may call it an accident. But you have to know, did God want that accident? Is it for the person’s punishment? Here I have to say that God does not want to punish us. God never punishes us. He may give us an experience, but if we go deep within, we will feel that God is actually having this experience. If we can identify ourselves consciously with the Will of the Supreme, then there is no such thing as an accident.</p>
<p>In the highest Light of the Supreme what we may call an accident or a catastrophe is actually a form of Delight. But we have to be in the Supreme’s Consciousness. Otherwise, an accident is something threatening, discouraging and painful. We can feel this only when we go beyond the domain of the physical world and identify ourselves consciously with the Will of the Supreme. At that time we get the deepest joy and the most meaningful purpose inside the accident itself.</p>
<p>Several days ago a disciple’s wife had a serious accident. She does not care for the spiritual life, but her husband is extremely devoted to me. He is a true and genuine seeker. If he had not been in the spiritual life, in the inner life, and marching, running towards his goal, his wife would now be in the world of death. So accidents that could take your life away can be prevented by somebody else’s aspiration. But the person who saves you must be your nearest and closest friend or relative. Because this disciple’s wife was his dearest in the outer world, she escaped death. She escaped on the strength of his aspiration. So there are many factors that can prevent accidents from taking place.</p>
