And what do you think the spiritual place of a man and a woman is in this life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the individual. If an individual feels the need of marriage, I tell him that if he gets married, he can feel that he has four hands, four eyes and so on. He has double strength, double capacity.</p>
<p>Then again, if someone is not meant for marriage, if he doesn't feel the necessity of marriage, then I tell him that he should feel he is running the fastest. There is nothing holding him back from his goal, whereas if he is married and the marriage does not work out, there will be tremendous suffering and life will become unbearable. So the individual has to make the choice.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule that one cannot realise God if he is married or if he is not married. No! It all depends on what God wants from him. If he feels from within that God wants him to get married, that God wants him to have that experience, then he is doing the right thing by getting married. If he feels that God does not want him to marry, then he should not do it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can a husband and wife have different teachers?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can a husband and wife have different teachers?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the husband and wife have different teachers, it is like going to the same goal along two roads. Problems will arise if the husband says that his road is clear, sunlit, whereas the wife's road is full of obstacles. Then trouble will start. But if the husband says, "I like this road and you like that road. So you go your own way, I will go my way, and we will reach the same destination," then it is all right. If the husband does not try to convert the wife and the wife does not try to convert the husband, that is the right thing. But when a feeling of comparison or competition enters, then all is lost.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The only thing we have to know is how much understanding and respect they have for each other's path. But it is always safe if they have the same Master, if they are walking along the same road. If the husband and wife follow the same path and the husband becomes tired, exhausted, assailed by doubt, then at that time the wife becomes his helper. And if the wife becomes assailed by doubt or fear, then the husband can be of real help. So if they follow the same path, it is a great advantage.</p>
<p>But if the wife says, "I want to follow the path of the heart," and the husband says, "I want to follow the path of the mind," what can they do? At that time the husband and wife have to be very careful. Each has to know that the other is doing the right thing, according to his or her own capacity and understanding. They should have mutual respect for each other's realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's Eye, there is no man, there is no woman. In God's Eye they are one. Man is the face; woman is the smile. Without the face, how can there be a smile? Again, if there is no smile, what good is the face? So both are equally important.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so grateful. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of dedicated service to you. Both of you have extremely beautiful souls, devoted, spiritual souls. You are serving God the Supreme, and I am also serving the Supreme. Here I have been doing something and you have been doing something. We are members of the same family. If I kept my capacity only for myself and if you kept your capacity only for yourselves, then we couldn't become one. When we unite our capacities, then only is God pleased with us.</p>
