  <h2 id="page-title">A twentieth century seeker</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A twentieth century seeker" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The twentieth century seeker is suffering. He is suffering from the loveless aridity of his heart. He is suffering from the confusion-market of his mind. He is suffering from the power-politics of his vital. He is suffering from the lethargy-supremacy of his body.</p>
<p>Depressed, he has been singing the song of self-resignation. Humiliated, he has been marching along the road of world-revolt.</p>
<p>Lo and behold! God, the Author of all Good, out of His infinite Compassion-Light, has removed from his aspiration-life the world of depression-night. God, the Author of all Good, has removed from his dedication-life the surrendered breath of humiliation-helplessness.</p>
<p>No more self-resignation-song; no more world-revolt-march! The seeker is now enjoying the life-acceptance-smile. His joyful acceptance of life is freedom from inactivity-indulgence.</p>
<p>There was a time when the seeker’s life was suspended in mid-air between the old fears and the new doubts. But the binding fears and the blinding doubts have finally disappeared, and indomitable courage and an unshakable faith have replaced them. Now the seeker aspires because he needs God’s all-liberating Heights. Now the seeker serves because he needs God’s all-illumining Depths.</p>
<p>His aspiration is God’s Silence-Life. His dedication is God’s Sound-Life. Silence-Life is God the Seed. Sound-Life is God the Fruit.</p>
<p>His aspiration is God’s Vision-Life. God’s Vision tells him that he is Eternity’s progress and Infinity’s success. Success receives; progress achieves. Success receives God-Satisfaction from the outer world of duty. Progress achieves God-Perfection from the inner world of beauty.</p>
<p>His dedication is God’s Manifestation-Life. God’s Manifestation tells him that he is of God and for God. He is of God in the inner world; he is for God in the outer world. In the inner world he is God’s Dream-Reality and in the outer world he is God’s Reality-Dream.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The five paths of love and devotion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The five paths of love and devotion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are five paths of love and devotion. In one path, one approaches God with a calm, quiet, soft, angelical, joyful attitude.</p>
<p>In the second, the seeker approaches God as though he were a slave and God were the master. If the seeker wants to approach God with this servant-like quality, this is the right path. Here the seeker is the eternal slave of God’s Love.</p>
<p>In the third approach, the seeker regards God as his eternal Friend, eternal Companion. In this path, the seeker speaks to God openly and freely, without obstruction. We can see the embodiment of this path in the relationship of Arjuna and Sri Krishna. Arjuna approached Lord Krishna as a friend, but eventually his relationship with Krishna changed, and he became a perfect, devoted disciple.</p>
<p>In the fourth relationship, God is considered as one’s own child. Nothing is expected from God, just as we never expect anything from a child, a baby. When we approach God in this way, we have no desire, conscious or unconscious, to take anything from Him. We do not want to take anything from a little baby. We only try to please the baby in his own way. In India there are many devotees of Lord Krishna who think of him as a child, an eternal child. This is a most significant path, but it is quite uncommon here in the West.</p>
<p>The fifth path is the path of sweetness. Here the lover and the beloved become one. In this path we see the union of the human, aspiring soul and the divine, fulfilling Soul. The human soul and the transcendental Self become inseparably one on the strength of the seeker’s absolute surrender. When an aspirant can offer his inner and outer existence completely, cheerfully, unreservedly and unconditionally to the Supreme, at that time he can achieve the sweetest inseparable oneness with the Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>These are the five approaches in the path of love, devotion and surrender. Each aspirant can walk along the path with one quality or with two or three.</p>
<p>Again, if he wants to have all the qualities, he can achieve this also. It depends on the individual aspirant, on what kind of relationship he wants to establish with his Inner Pilot or with the Supreme in his spiritual Master.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many who will sit in front of a spiritual Master, talk to a spiritual Master, mix with him, have all kinds of intimate experiences with him, but they will get nothing. It is only aspiration that will be able to bring to the fore all the divine qualities of the Master. If we have no aspiration, then no matter what the Master has, no matter what kind of spiritual height he has, he will not be able to give us anything.</p>
<p>To get the most from your spiritual life, the qualities you need are peace, joy, love, power and sincere inner concern for your spiritual Master. These you can have on the strength of your own aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The path and its teacher are inseparable. If you accept me, you have to accept my path. If you follow my path, then you have to accept me. Vision and reality can never be separated; true vision and reality are one. So, inside me you will see that the vision and reality cannot be separated. Just as fire and its flames can never be separated, so a spiritual Master and his path cannot be separated.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I tell my disciples that I am not their leader. The real leader is God. God is your leader, my leader, the supreme Leader. God has told me to inspire my students for the time that I am on earth. I am a source of their inspiration. But I don’t tell them that I am God. I don’t say that I am their realisation. I am just their inspiration. God is their realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each disciple has his own level of development and the Guru has to guide each one individually. If someone is more developed, then the Guru has to deal with him in one way. If somebody is less developed, then the Guru has to deal with him differently. There is no systematic rule. A lion, a cat, a donkey and a monkey will not all be of the same standard. It is not possible. So what the Guru does is tell them “You come individually and meditate with me. I will give you your meditation and I will know when you are achieving something inwardly. Then I shall help you and guide you.” So the Guru cannot deal with all in the same way. God has given us ten fingers, and they are not of the same shape; they are not of the same length and breadth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may not immediately recognise that I am your Master because of fear or doubt, but gradually you will feel joy. Your inner joy will grow like a muscle and become very strong. The Master is someone who has tremendous love. It is the Master’s love that is transformed into joy in the disciple’s heart. So when you feel joy, tremendous joy, from being with a spiritual Master, please feel that that person is your true Master. When there is strong faith in the seeker’s own life, then the Master’s presence immediately convinces the seeker that he is the true Master. Also, the moment you get your Master, you become a spiritual child; you act like a divine child. This is another way that you will know.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I see a person who wants to become my disciple, even before he asks the question about being accepted, the answer is already there. So I wish to tell you that I accept both of you wholeheartedly. Before you formed the question I knew this. When I ask seekers to send me a picture and short resume, in a fleeting second after I open it I make the decision whether to accept or reject them. The Supreme in me makes the decision.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whomever I select definitely is meant for our path. People do not come to us all of a sudden. They come because they have a connection here. Sometimes they have a dream about me or they read my books and get intense joy. People I take are definitely meant for me, but then they go away. It is not because they chose the wrong path. They go away not because they made a mistake. Their mistake was to leave the Centre.</p>

So please do not be afraid of me. Please forgive me, but we have to run far — very, very far. When you are not afraid of me, when there is no fear inside you, when you are all love and surrender to the Will of the Supreme, at that time you will run the fastest.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Among the disciples there are many souls who were previously together, so in this incarnation they have again established an inner oneness. Suppose you have established an inner oneness with five or ten or fifteen people. Their good thoughts and bad thoughts will then affect you more than they will inspire or affect others.</p>
<p>I definitely know that there are a few group souls among my disciples. They may not be only here, but also in San Francisco or Canada or in other Centres. It does not have to be here, for in the inner world there is no separation. Sometimes these souls have similar dreams, but on different planes. For instance, you may have a dream on a particular branch of the reality-tree and on a different branch another person will have the same dream. Then the following day you may forget the dream, but you will have such good feelings for that person. Perhaps when you are on the street or at work, that person will flow before your mind, although you were not thinking of him at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is absolutely true. I always look for quality and not quantity. I have come across thousands and thousands of seekers, many who were very sincere, but they were not meant for our path. Out of seventy thousand or more whom I have come across, I have accepted only seven hundred disciples. I feel that when I go to God, He will not ask me how many disciples I have; He will ask only about those who are meant for me. The Boss has asked me to do one particular thing and I will do that very thing. He will ask me about those for whom I am responsible and I will answer, “Yes, these are the persons that You asked me to take and I have done it.” I care for quality and not for quantity. We always say that it is quality that God appreciates.</p>
