  <h2 id="page-title">The shepherd boy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The shepherd boy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a poor shepherd boy who lived in England. He loved nothing but games and his friends loved him dearly for his childlike nature. But one day one of his friends told him, "I am not going to waste so much time with you in playing. It is a waste of time. We have to value time."</p>
<p>The poor shepherd was so grateful to his friend for his wise advice. When he was fifteen years old, the Lord granted him a powerful and vivid vision of the Lord Himself. The boy then gave up everything and wanted to become a saint. He entered a monastery. Later, he became a hermit on a small island off the coast.</p>
<p>In the course of time, he was made a bishop and he went from village to village cheerfully, devotedly and unconditionally to spread the message of the Saviour.</p>
<p>Although by nature this priest wanted to live a life of seclusion, for that is what he loved most, his love of God and his service to mankind came first and foremost. So he gladly fulfilled his divine duty.</p>
<p>His name was Saint Cuthbert.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The saint-king</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The saint-king" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a very soulful God-lover and, at the same time, a very powerful man-ruler in Denmark. He ruled his kingdom powerfully in the sense that there could be no corruption in his kingdom and not that he wanted to show his supremacy over his subjects. His power-life and soulful heart he utilised in a divine way.</p>
<p>At the dawn of his reign, he had to fight against the barbarians. He defeated them easily and placed his victorious crown at the feet of Christ in a church. He gave the credit to Christ. He felt that it was the Christ-force acting in and through him that conquered the barbarian force. Therefore, he was extremely grateful to Christ and placed his victory's crown on the altar.</p>
<p>In this life, unfortunately, when we become great and good, we become a victim to others' jealousy, meanness and hatred. So it was that this King had many enemies. His enemies did not appreciate his good qualities and, above all, they did not appreciate his support for the Church.</p>
<p>The King wanted everyone to go to church regularly and support the church in every possible way. He wanted people to be spiritual and he wanted the church to be more disciplined and self-giving. His enemies could not tolerate this. They wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>One day the King was in the church praying. His enemies came to the church. The King knew his enemies intended to harm him and so, before any harm could fall on him, he prayed to the Christ to forgive them. Then he prostrated himself before the cross and awaited death. Lo and behold, his enemies threw a spear at him through a window and killed him.</p>
<p>A heart of compassion and a soul of forgiveness was he. He is our Saint Canute.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Egyptian saint</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Egyptian saint" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In a small village in Egypt he was born. His parents were rich. When he was twenty years old, both his parents died and he became the owner of a large estate. He had a younger sister. Both brother and sister were kind to each other and fond of each other. Both of them decided to lead the spiritual life.</p>
<p>One day this young man heard something in the church that transformed his consciousness: "Give everything to the poor and follow me, if you want to have your treasure in Heaven." He thought that this message was meant directly for him. So he gave away everything. His sister was glad that he did so. She joined a convent to lead a spiritual life. She became a nun.</p>
<p>He went into the desert to remove himself from worldly distractions. There he received spiritual instruction from several hermits. In the course of time, many people began to flock to him for spiritual guidance. When he was over fifty, he built a monastery. By that time, he had many devoted disciples and admirers. They all needed his advice. They all admired his inner depth.</p>
<p>He told them that all problems can be solved only through prayers. There is and there can be no other way. He told them, "We are afraid of the devil. The devil is afraid of us. The devil is afraid of us when we pray, specially when we love Jesus with all our heart and soul."</p>
<p>He lived a very long life. He ended his earthly existence in a cave at the age of 105. His was a life not only of God-service to man but also man-illumination for God. Discouragement was a stranger to him. Continuous enthusiasm, continuous zeal, continuous self-giving his aspiration-heart and dedication-life became.</p>
<p>He is our St. Anthony of the Desert.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The choice of the two brothers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The choice of the two brothers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were two brothers who were born in Italy. They had tremendous love for their religion, Christianity, and both of them tirelessly performed countless services for the needy.</p>
<p>These two brothers happened to be extremely close to one another. The Bishop of their district made them priests and they began to preach devotedly and unreservedly to the poor and the rich alike.</p>
<p>Fear could not torment them, although their enemies tried to kill them. When the Emperor Hadrian came to hear about these two brothers, he put them into prison and asked his soldiers to torture them mercilessly.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor informed the brothers that either they would have to give up their Christian faith totally or they would have to suffer unspeakably until the end in the hands of the soldiers.</p>
<p>The brothers gladly chose torture and suffering and did not abandon Christianity. These two brothers were Saint Faustinus and Saint Jovita.</p>

 <p>
TRNS 34-50. Sri Chinmoy related these stories about some of the world's immortal artists in February and March 1980.</p>
<h2>Two surprises plus one astonishment</h2>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci, when a young boy, drew a picture of a strikingly powerful monster, belching fire and poison, then proudly placed it on a window ledge to surprise his father. When his father came home and saw the picture, he had the shock of his life. The monster was so vivid, so real!</p>
<p>Very shortly after that, his father got the opportunity to spring a surprise on the little Leonardo by enrolling him in an art class.</p>
<p>The Mother Earth did not want to remain in pin-drop silence. She astonished both father and son by making the son the most astonishingly immortal artist-man on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Leonardo da Vinci&#039;s vision</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Leonardo da Vinci&#039;s vision" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Leonardo da Vinci had tremendous fondness for flying. He was all affection for birds. He used to buy them in large numbers only to set them free and watch them fly. He was fascinated by their flight.</p>
<p>For a long time, he wanted to make an aeroplane. With greatest difficulty, he succeeded in making a model of a flying machine that would be propelled by the wind, and he made up his mind that on a certain day he would fly. Alas, one of his pupils, Zoroaste de Peretolo, was clever enough or foolish enough to steal the aeroplane and he himself tried to fly it. As ill luck would have it, he went up a little and then fell down and paid the price. He broke one of his legs.</p>
<p>So the poor artist was saved from his own creation. But who can deny da Vinci's vision? He could not transform it into reality, but later on, human beings did make aeroplanes and fly in them.</p>
<p>Today's vision is tomorrow's reality. Vision may take time before it manifests itself into reality. But vision is always appreciable and admirable.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The immortalising smile</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The immortalising smile" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Leonardo da Vinci is truly immortal. He achieved wonders in many walks of life. Not only in the world of art, but also in the worlds of literature, the sciences, architecture, engineering and many other fields he became a real immortal. His most important and significant artistic work, which fascinates the entire world, is the <em>Mona Lisa</em>.</p>
<p>Mona Lisa was the wife of an elderly nobleman. Da Vinci took quite a few days to paint her portrait. She used to come and sit before him, but she would never smile and she was never in a mood to be entertained. Da Vinci tried in so many ways to make her smile. Finally, he resorted to music and he hired a band of musicians to entertain her. The musicians played for a few days, but there was still no response from Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>One day, just for a fleeting second, she gave a faint smile, and da Vinci was able to catch it. That smile has immortalised her, immortalised the artist and immortalised the art. Artist and art have been immortalised by just a faint smile, a smile that has an enigmatic touch. Even now a soul-touch is there, and that soul-touch has conquered the heart of the world. Because of that smile, the artist and the art at once have touched Immortality's Shore and become immortal.</p>

<p>Michelangelo had a temper of the quickest. He used to quarrel and fight in season and out of season. A young sculptor named Torrigiani was terribly jealous of Michelangelo's ability. On his part, there was jealousy and, on Michelangelo's part, there was anger. So jealousy and anger fought together.</p>
<p>In the fight, Torrigiani struck Michelangelo mercilessly and broke his nose. As a result, Torrigiani was compelled to flee the city. Michelangelo's nose remained disfigured for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Michelangelo loved to glorify the human body in its pristine form — that means, as natural as possible. He was wont to create his figures as God made them, with the fewest of clothes. He was ruthlessly assailed by certain moralists for his <em>Last Judgement</em>. A Vatican official felt that this particular painting was another name for a shocking and unspeakable experience. In order to console the poor official, Michelangelo made a few changes. He added a donkey's ears and a snake's tail. The immortal artist proved to be an overnight trickster.</p>

<p>Michelangelo and Pope Julius II were always in the habit of quarrelling. The artist would frequently find it impossible to comply with the Pope's requests or commands. Once the Pope asked Michelangelo to add gold to some figures. Michelangelo responded, "It cannot be. Holy men cannot wear gold. They are poor."</p>
<p>The Pope argued, "Why not? They can!"</p>
<p>The artist would not listen, but on this occasion Pope Julius did not want to fight. He was sick of fighting with Michelangelo for he knew that the artist had a temper of the quickest, the worst possible temper. So he forgave Michelangelo's outbursts and rewarded him for his extraordinary capacities as an artist.</p>
<p>Here the Pope valued the art, ignoring the shortcomings of the artist.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">An unusual justice-light</h2><span property="dc:title" content="An unusual justice-light" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>An art-lover named Agnolo Doni commissioned Michelangelo to do a special painting of the Holy Family for his bride-to-be. The payment was to be seventy ducats. When Michelangelo completed the painting, he felt that it was a tremendous success and he sent it to Agnolo's house by messenger. Agnolo saw the painting and was greatly delighted. But all of a sudden, an unthinkable deception captured his mind. He gave the messenger forty ducats, instead of seventy, to give to Michelangelo.</p>
<p>When the messenger returned and gave Michelangelo the forty ducats, the artist became furious. He gave the money back to the messenger to return to Agnolo with a note: "I cannot put up with a despicable liar like you. I am demanding more money than was in our agreement, since you have not kept your promise. Therefore, you must give me thirty extra ducats."</p>
<p>This time the messenger came back from Agnolo with seventy ducats, which was the sum they had first agreed to. Michelangelo's anger reached its zenith. He said, "Agnolo, since you are not a man of principle, I shall have to deal with you in an unthinkable way. You must send me one hundred and forty ducats, double the amount on which we first agreed. For the liar, there is only one kind of medicine: an unusual justice-light."</p>
<p>Because Agnolo's wedding day was fast approaching and he needed the painting for his bride-to-be, he was compelled to give Michelangelo the full amount.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Fondness and oneness go together</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Fondness and oneness go together" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Michelangelo was usually averse to leaving his name on his sculpture. But in the case of his beloved <em>Pietà</em>, he compelled the artist in him to leave his signature on the work. This is how it happened.</p>
<p>Once, a large number of strangers from Lombardy came to see his <em>Pietà</em>. They were all appreciation. In fact, they were wonderstruck. One of them wanted to know who the sculptor was. The immediate answer came from another in the gathering, "Who else could achieve this kind of miracle, if not our Gabo of Milan?"</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately, Michelangelo happened to be on the scene. A most powerful sadness tortured his being and he cursed the ignorant world. So one night, when no human being was visible around his beloved <em>Pietà</em> he cheerfully and proudly carved his name on the work. He felt that his fondness for his immortal sculpture and his immortal oneness with it must needs go together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The ploughman versus the Christ</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The ploughman versus the Christ" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were two great artists from Florence — Donatello and Filippo Brunelleschi. Once, when Donatello was quite young, he made a crucifix of wood and thought he had achieved nothing short of perfect perfection. He invited his dear friend Brunelleschi to offer his wise comment. Needless to say, inwardly he was dying for the best possible appreciation, which he felt he so rightly deserved. Alas, his dream-world was shattered to pieces when Brunelleschi said to him, "I see a ploughman on the cross instead of the Saviour."</p>
<p>Donatello was utterly mortified by this unexpected criticism from the older artist. He said, "You are a great judge! But let me see you do it yourself. You say I made a ploughman instead of Jesus Christ. Let me see your masterpiece of the crucifixion."</p>
<p>That very day Brunelleschi began working on his crucifix. In due course, Brunelleschi completed his sculpture. One day, by chance, he met with his dear friend Donatello in a grocery. Brunelleschi said to his friend, "Tonight you will have supper with me. Please do me a favour. I have bought these items and I have still more items to buy. Will you be good enough to carry these items to my house? I shall be coming home shortly."</p>
<p>Donatello gladly complied with his friend's request, carrying a few eggs and some cheese in his apron. Upon entering Brunelleschi's studio, he got the shock of his life. Perfection incarnate was Brunelleschi's sculpture of the crucifixion. Utterly amazed, he lost his outer senses and dropped the apron containing the eggs and cheese. Everything was smashed and all was perfect chaos before the immortal sculpture.</p>
<p>On his return, when Brunelleschi saw the great calamity, he said to his friend, "What is the matter with you? What are we going to have now for dinner?"</p>
<p>Donatello said, "Sorry, I have already had my dinner. Your supremely great achievement has fed me to my heart's content. I feel sorry for you that you have nothing to eat. Now, listen to my sincere heart. The difference between you and me is this: you know how to make the Christ and I know how to make a ploughman."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tintoretto&#039;s entry</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tintoretto&#039;s entry" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Four Italian artists were invited to make a design for a large mural, and eventually a selection would be made. While the other artists were labouring at their designs, Tintoretto, in secret, measured the actual size of the space. Then, not only secretly but also rapidly, he painted a great canvas and placed it in the exact place for the public to appreciate.</p>
<p>The officials who had invited him to enter the competition did not appreciate the artist's dishonest manner. They were extremely angry with him. How could he do this without being formally commissioned?</p>
<p>Tintoretto said to these officials: "Dear friends, this is how the artist in me works. Now either you buy it as a piece of art or take it as a small gift."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Rembrandt&#039;s love for his monkey</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Rembrandt&#039;s love for his monkey" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The great artist Rembrandt was extremely attached to his possessions. One of his possessions was a pet monkey. He was extremely fond of this monkey and, alas, when it died, he felt extremely miserable, to say the least. A strong desire haunted him for some time. He wanted to keep some kind of remembrance of this monkey.</p>
<p>Once, a couple came to Rembrandt's studio for their portrait. The artist did a very good job. Then he begged them to allow him to paint from memory a picture of his pet monkey in the portrait. The couple said, "No, it cannot be done. We do not want your monkey to be in the picture with us."</p>
<p>Rembrandt insisted and insisted, but the couple did not listen to his request. Nevertheless, he drew the monkey's picture in the portrait. As soon as they saw what he had done, the couple became furious. They left the artist's studio without taking the picture.</p>
<p>So Rembrandt's love for his monkey far surpassed his love for name, fame and money-power. And he cherished that painting for the rest of his life.</p>
