<p>When you have to lose weight, it is no joke. Today I took only four hundred calories and ran fifteen and a half miles â€” only to lose weight.</p>
<p>Usually I weigh more after I finish running than I did before I started. This time I decided to catch the culprit! Before I went out, I weighed my ERG bottle when it was full. It weighed one pound and three ounces. Then I subtracted the weight of the bottle â€” an ounce and a quarter. From now on after I run I will know how much I have gained from drinking.</p>

<p>The Toledo Marathon in 1979 was my best marathon. I did it in 3:55. It was so cold that day! Sometimes I was running on the left side so I could pass people, but sometimes I ran in between people to keep warm. In the beginning, before the sun came out, it was twenty-four degrees, so I was running in between people. Even so, at one point my back was freezing.</p>

<p>Just before the four-mile run started, I was unfortunately standing beside a man who was very hostile. While Tarak was giving instructions to the runners, the man said, "Stop chirping!"</p>
<p>When Tarak asked for one minute of silence, the man said, "What nonsense!"</p>
<p>This same man finished far behind me in the race.</p>

<p>When I reached the turnaround point in our four-mile race, I saw that Kumuda was behind me. My ego became so big and my chest expanded. But Karabi, her sister-in-law, was no good. After eight hundred metres she and Savita went ahead of me. At least I was ahead of Sunanda and Nilima for five hundred metres.</p>
<p>Barada was so nice to so many people. She started the race five minutes late, so she did not defeat me or any of the others who were ahead of me.</p>

<p>After running our four-mile race, I ran the ten-kilometre or 6.2-mile Foliage Run in New Jersey. The course had good mile markers and it was very beautiful. The trees on both sides of the road gave shade and created a soothing atmosphere. These kinds of races are really good. Sometimes in the races with thousands of people you get lost.</p>
<p>The only problem was that at times the course was dangerous because of the cars. Even near the finish line two cars were driving in front of me and not allowing me to go by them. At another place there was a parked car and the runners couldn't make a turn properly. Of course, this is because of the speed we were maintaining. The race officials were very careful that the front runners were unobstructed.</p>
<p>Also, there were many hills on the course â€” practically mountains. At one point, I walked about fifty metres up a very steep hill. I didn't dare run up it. Everybody else was also walking.</p>

<p>One child about ten years old was competing with me mile after mile. He was not running; he was dancing and jumping. I didn't see his feet touching the ground!</p>
<p>Then he saw a little girl who was younger than he was go ahead of us and his ego came forward. He could not bear it. He ran very fast to go ahead of me and catch her. Then he saw that she had stopped; she had surrendered. After five miles the little boy himself surrendered and I didn't see him anymore.</p>

<p>After the Foliage Run the officials were making announcements for runners to turn in their place cards. My card was just sitting on the grass near me. Finally Pahar saw it and went to return it. So I was one of the culprits in that respect. But they were not waiting for the place card of finisher number 236 â€” me. They were waiting for the cards of some of the top runners.</p>
