<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<p>I am very pleased to invite you to the University of Washington as a Visiting Poet on April 2, 1998. Your Peace Concert will take place in Roethke Auditorium in Kane Hall (in the center of campus) at 7:30 p.m. on April 2. We are now arranging a location for your poetry and art display. Our university has been the home to many renowned writers, including Theodore Roethke, for whom the hall in which you will be performing was named.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Department of English, Professor Charles Johnson and I will be very honored to present you with the Light of Asia award for sharing your wisdom with millions of people worldwide. We are very much looking forward to your Peace Concert and also to the display of your poetry and artwork. Your visit is a great honor for our students, faculty and staff, and we are proud that the Department of English has been given the opportunity to serve as the sponsor of your visit to our campus.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shawn Wong, Chairman</p>
<p>Department of English</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poet and poetry</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Poet and poetry" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A poet has three very special names: yesterday's delight-seeker, today's delight-seer and tomorrow's delight-harbinger.</p>
<p>There are three types of poets: ordinary poets, great poets and seer-poets. Ordinary poets grow like mushrooms in infinite number. The great poets are few and far between and are also known as born poets. The seer-poets are of the supreme heights. A seer is he who envisions the present, the past and the future all at once.</p>
<p>Poetry has three very special names: inspiration-mind, aspiration-heart and beauty-life.</p>
<p>God wanted to have a very, very special garden of His own. He asked His poet-son to be the gardener. He also asked the gardener to create a garden as beautiful as possible and, at the same time, as small as possible.</p>
<p>The poet-gardener devotedly asked God if there was any esoteric purpose for the garden to be smaller than the smallest and beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful.</p>
<p>God said to His newly appointed poet-gardener, "What is poetry, if not My real Beauty? Do you not recall what My English poet-son Keats' immortal utterance is: 'A thing of Beauty is a Joy forever'? Beauty and Infinity are inseparable. I want to reveal the Infinity that I am through the finite that I equally am. Therefore, I am asking you to make Me a garden of beauty unfathomable and beauty unsurpassable."</p>
<p>God further said to His poet-gardener, "My son, once you have accomplished your task to My Satisfaction, I shall entrust you with another task. You will be the only flute player in My garden. Infinity's Beauty-lovers from the four corners of the globe shall visit and drink deep the beauty of our garden."</p>
<p>The difference between a prose writer and a poet is this:</p>
<p>A prose writer is a marcher. He marches and marches along Eternity's Road to arrive at Infinity's Goal.</p>
<p>A poet is a singer. He sings and sings along Eternity's Road to arrive at Infinity's Goal.</p>
<p>The prose writer has thunder-legs.</p>
<p>The poet has lightning-feet.</p>
<p>Arriving at the destination, the prose writer declares,</p>
<p>"I have become."</p>
<p>Arriving at the same destination, the poet whispers,</p>
<p>"I eternally am."</p>
<p>I have been writing prose and poetry for over half a century. I am very happily and proudly sailing in the boat of Coleridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wish our clever poets would remember...Prose: words in their best order. Poetry: the best words in the best order."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it is illumining to read a comment by Rabindranath Tagore, the master poet of India, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1913. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wonder why the writing of pages of prose does not give anything like the joy of completing a single poem. One's emotions take such perfection of form in a poem, they can be taken up by the fingers, so to speak. While prose is like a sackful of loose material, incapable of being lifted as you please."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poetry I read to lighten my mind and enlighten my heart.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to sweeten my bitter mind.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to replace my heart's sorrows with my soul's ecstasy.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to transform my human mind-jungle into my divine heart-garden.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to fathom my own inner worlds and to scale my own higher worlds.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to see and feel Divinity's Beauty inside the heart of humanity.</p>
<p>Poetry I read to watch the hide-and-seek of my heart's tearing tears and my soul's blossoming smiles.</p>
<p>Poetry teaches my heart infinitely more than it preaches to my mind.</p>
<p>Ancient poetry pined for inner freedom. Modern poetry hungers for outer freedom.</p>
<p>Since, according to many, I am a modern poet, I do not know how I can escape from Goethe's irrefutable observation of modern poets: "Modern poets mix too much water with their ink."</p>
<p>Ancient poetry paid more attention to the Unknowable than the knowable. Modern poetry maximises the power of the knowable and allows the Unknowable to remain a stranger, a perfect stranger.</p>
<p>The ancient poetry-boat was quite often overloaded with poetry-passenger-readers. The modern poetry-boat is quite often empty of poetry-passenger-readers.</p>
<p>Now what about those who are not poetry-lovers at all — no, not even poetry-readers? They do not care in the least either for ancient poetry or for modern poetry. Dear audience, with your soul's permission, I am crying ditto to a statement by Anthony Hope Hawkins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wish you would read a little poetry sometimes. Your ignorance cramps my conversation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ancient poetry loved to swim in the sea of tears. Modern poetry loves to surf in the ocean of laughter.</p>
<p>Poetry tells the world, "O world, I am a flower. Appreciate my beauty if you want to. Enjoy my fragrance if you want to. But do not expect from me anything more than my beauty and my fragrance. If you expect anything more, you will be doomed to disappointment."</p>
<p>Poetry tells the world, "O world, I can teach you how to smile, even while you are crying."</p>
<p>In my case also, I have my own ancient poetry and modern poetry. My ancient poetry embodied my inner cry:</p>

<p>A sea of Peace and Joy and Light<br /> Beyond my reach I know.<br /> In me the storm-tossed weeping night<br /> Finds room to rage and flow.</p>

<p>My modern poetry reveals my inner smile:</p>

<p>I am flying and flying<br /> On Immortality's Wings<br /> In Infinity's Sky.</p>

<p>When I started my poetry-journey, my inner experiences and realisations spontaneously expressed themselves through the power-aspect:</p>

<p>No mind, no form, I only exist;<br /> Now ceased all will and thought.<br /> The final end of Nature's dance,<br /> I am It whom I have sought.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>My spirit aware of all the heights,<br /> I am mute in the core of the Sun.<br /> I barter nothing with time and deeds;<br /> My cosmic play is done.</p>

<p>As I continue my poetry-journey, my inner experiences and realisations spontaneously express themselves through humility and devotion-aspects:</p>

<p>My Lord,<br /> Your Love has entrapped my eyes,<br /> My heart, my life and my all.<br /> May I be allowed to entrap<br /> The hallowed dust of Your Feet?</p>

<p>Throughout my poetry-journey, my poetry-tree has cherished various branches: philosophy, prayer, religion, spirituality, my love of Nature's beauty, my love of word-making, which the English language indulgently allows me to explore, and my abiding love, concern and hope for this world of ours.</p>
<p>When nationalism captures my mind, I soulfully sing:</p>

<p>I dearly love my India<br /> And her age-old silence-peace.</p>

<p>When internationalism embraces my heart, I offer my sleepless and breathless prayer-song to God:</p>

<p>My Lord, do give me the capacity<br /> To wipe every tear<br /> From every heart.</p>

<p>Wherever I go, Nature's beauty enters into me and feeds me with abundant inspiration:</p>

<p>The sky calls me.<br /> The wind calls me.<br /> The moon and stars call me.<br /> The green and dense groves call me.<br /> The dance of the fountain calls me.<br /> Smiles call me, tears call me.<br /> A faint melody calls me.<br /> The morn, noon and eve call me.</p>
<p>Everyone is searching for a playmate.<br /> Everyone is calling me, "Come, come!"<br /> One voice, one sound, all around.<br /> Alas, the Boat of Time sails on.</p>

<p>It was Horace who offered us the following illumining definition of poets: "Poets, the first instructors of mankind."</p>
<p>May I add,</p>

<p>Poets, the first God-Beauty-lovers<br /> of God-Nature-creation.</p>


<p>Poetry is not something to be understood.<br /> Poetry is not something even to be felt.<br /> Poetry is something to discover one's universal Reality.<br /> Poetry is something to uncover one's transcendental Divinity.</p>

<p>I am deeply honoured to be talking to you in this august hall dedicated to Theodore Roethke, the esteemed American poet who was a beloved professor and poet-in-residence at this university. According to my humble opinion, Theodore Roethke was truly a God-Beauty-lover in God the creation. I would like to end my talk today by invoking the presence of his bright illumination-soul: "The Light Comes Brighter," which celebrates the simultaneous arrival of Spring in nature and in the mind:</p>

<p>"...soon a branch, part of a hidden scene,<br /> The leafy mind, that long was tightly furled,<br /> Will turn its private substance into green,<br /> And young shoots spread upon our inner world."</p>

<p>My highly esteemed Chairman Shawn Wong, my lovingly revered Professor Charles Johnson, your university is unique for its motto: "Lux Sit," "Let there be Light." Your love of light, both the light of the soul and the light of the mind, is supremely unparalleled. Today you are kindly, compassionately and blessingfully honouring me with The Light of Asia Award. In silence-secrecy-ecstasy I am sowing the seeds of my heart's gratitude-tears and gratitude-smiles in your beauty-non-pareil-heart-gardens.</p>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy:</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to invite you to speak at Florida International University in the Wertheim Performing Arts Center, on May 26, 1998 as a visiting philosopher.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege of meeting you before, and I am sure your audience at FIU will be delighted to hear your words, your music, and your presence. The Department of Religious Studies is working with the local Sri Chinmoy Centre on all arrangements, and we look forward to seeing you in Miami next month, and to presenting you with a plaque honoring you as "India's Peace-Service-Tree" to mark this auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>The philosophy of the mind says:<br /> God perhaps has.<br /> The philosophy of the heart says:<br /> God certainly is.<br /> The philosophy of life says:<br /> God is both the seeker and the Sought.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the mind-philosophy, I declare:</p>

<p>No mind, no form, I only exist;<br /> Now ceased all will and thought.<br /> The final end of Nature's dance,<br /> I am It whom I have sought.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>My spirit aware of all the heights,<br /> I am mute in the core of the Sun.<br /> I barter nothing with time and deeds;<br /> My cosmic play is done.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the heart-philosophy, I whisper:</p>

<p>Sweet is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Eternal Truth.<br /> Sweeter is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the only Doer.<br /> Sweetest is my Lord.<br /> Him I have realised as the Enjoyer Supreme.</p>

<p>When I go beyond the life-philosophy, I promise:</p>

<p>Never to meet again:<br /> My yesterday's face,<br /> My backward race,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>
<p>Never to meet again:<br /> The clasp of death<br /> And Satan's breath,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>
<p>Never to meet again:<br /> Chinmoy the failure,<br /> Ignorance sure,<br /> Never to meet again.</p>

<p>The cruel critics of philosophy say that philosophy is nowhere to nothingness and nothingness to nowhere. The same critics say that philosophy is absurdity's longevity. They also venture to say that in everything there is a winner, but when two philosophers fight, there is no winner, no loser. In this connection, I wish to cite the opposing views of two immortals in their different fields. Beethoven, who is vested with supreme authority in the musical world, says:</p>
<p>"Music is a higher revelation than philosophy."</p>
<p>Fortunately, Milton, the immortal epic poet, is there to gainsay this denigration of philosophy. Milton writes:</p>

<p>"How charming is divine philosophy!<br /> Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose,<br /> But musical as is Apollo's lute."</p>

<p>Between the two, I must needs cast my vote with Milton and place philosophy on the same level as music in its capacity to reveal and manifest the Divine here on earth.</p>
<p>To me, philosophy is the mind-clearance. Philosophy is the heart-assurance. Philosophy is the life-transcendence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of my mind says: "I doubt."<br /> The philosophy of my heart says: "I hope."<br /> The philosophy of my life says: "I am lost."<br /> The philosophy of my soul says: "I promise."<br /> The philosophy of my Lord says: "It is all done."</p>

<p>In May 1882, the great German scholar Max Müller delivered a series of lectures at Cambridge University. The first was entitled, "What Can India Teach Us?" Professor Müller expressed himself most powerfully and succinctly by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered over the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions to some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant-I should point to India.</p>
<p>"And if I were to ask myself from what literature we, here in Europe, we, who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life-again I should point to India."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Max Müller ventured to study India's ancient scriptures, the Vedas, in their original Sanskrit, he truly discovered the wealth of meaning behind Hamlet's words: "There are more things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</p>
<p>With your kind permission, I wish to take a leaf from Professor Müller's life-book and ask, "What can Indian philosophy teach us?"</p>
<p>Indian philosophy does not subscribe to the salvation from sin philosophy. Indian philosophy subscribes to the liberation from ignorance-night philosophy. It offers to humanity an unparalleled prayer:</p>

<p>Lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br /> Lead me from darkness to Light.<br /> Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>

<p>This kind of philosophy is not God-speculation, but soulful God-invocation based on an intuitive certainty of God's existence. Hence, we can never apply to it the criticism made by Keats that "Philosophy will clip an angel's wings." Indeed, Indian philosophy is most closely connected with that of the ancient Greeks. It was Socrates who declared, "The unexamined life is not worth living," and Plato who said, "True philosophers are lovers of the vision of Truth."</p>
<p>In order to understand Indian philosophy, we must first realise that it is founded upon Spirit and Matter. Spirit plays the role of involution. Matter plays the role of evolution. Spirit is inward dive. Matter is upward flight.</p>
<p>Now, God has a habit of repeating Himself so that nobody remains with His Philosophy unlearned. In India, this divine philosophy has been embodied and expressed in age after age by her spiritual Masters and Avatars, or direct descendants of God.</p>
<p>India's first Avatar Sri Ramachandra's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Obedience and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Give up all religions.<br />"Take shelter in Me."<br />"You I shall liberate."<br />"Be thou only an instrument."<br />"You have the right to work, but not to the fruits thereof."</p>
<p>Lord Buddha's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Compassion and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Sri Chaitanya's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Love unconditionally.<br />Everybody has the right to deserve love.</p>
<p>India's philosopher unparalleled Sri Shankaracharya's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Neti, neti. Not this, not this.<br />The world is an illusion.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna's philosophy is:</p>
<p>The synthesis of all religions.<br />Be a child-heart; God will immediately be all yours.</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda's philosophy is:</p>
<p>Be brave.<br />Have adamantine will-power.<br />"The soul cannot be won by the weakling."</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo's philosophy is:</p>
<p>The acceptance of life.<br />Yoga integral.<br />"Fate can be changed by an unchanging Will."<br />"We are sons of God and must be even as He."</p>
<p>Ramana Maharshi's philosophy is:</p>
<p>"Who am I? Who am I?"</p>
<p>Since I am a son of my Mother India, I, too, have my own philosophy. My philosophy is:</p>

<p>Love, devotion and surrender.<br /> Love the Supreme in humanity.<br /> Devote yourself to the Supreme in humanity.<br /> Surrender yourself to the Supreme in humanity.</p>

<p>Each philosopher-sage of the highest order realises the Truth in his own way. Each one creates a path which others may follow in order to arrive at the Destination: the Golden Shore of the Beyond. But the Truth itself does not vary. That is why we say that the Indian philosophy, the Indian religion and the Indian spirituality all have the self-same source.</p>

<p>2 June 1998</p>
<p>PROFESSOR MANDAKRANTA BOSE (Chair and Co-ordinator, Cross-Cultural Literary Studies in Asia Group): Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure and delight to welcome Sri Chinmoy to the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p><em>(Reading the text of the "Dreamer of Peace" award)</em> "Sri Chinmoy is a fervent and tireless dreamer of humanity's most cherished dream, the dream of peace amongst all peoples of the world family. It is to this sterling vision that Sri Chinmoy has sleeplessly and undauntedly dedicated his life. His service to peace includes an enormous body of creative offerings that uplift and ennoble the human spirit. These include poetry, plays, essays, paintings, drawings and musical compositions. Through his artistic works as well as his Peace Concert series, the international Peace-Blossom programme, and the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run, countless men and women worldwide have gained the inspiration to serve the cause of world peace. By sharing his peace-vision in myriad ways, Sri Chinmoy has abundantly revealed the wisdom and beauty of a life consecrated to higher ideals. May his peace- dream and peace-service grow into an abiding and universal reality for all humanity."</p>
<p>As a token of appreciation from the programme in Inter-Cultural Studies in Asia at the Institute of Asian Research, I am deeply honoured to offer this award to Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>SRI CHINMOY: I wish to offer gratitude from the inmost recesses of my heart to our esteemed Professor Mandakranta Bose for so lovingly and compassionately inviting me to this august university and for blessingfully honouring me today with this signal honour, the "Dreamer of Peace" award.</p>
<p>Professor Bose, I am deeply moved by your personal concern and powerful determination to arrange my entire visit. My admiring mind applauds and applauds you for your many significant official responsibilities which you so capably carry. My aspiring heart unmistakably and proudly feels the teeming divine qualities-inspiring, aspiring and self-giving qualities-which you have, and from your Bengali heart, you are sharing so lovingly and unreservedly with all, near and far.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poetry the winner</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Poetry the winner" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A poet sees what we cannot see — the highest Beauty's golden crown, the deepest Beauty's golden throne.</p>
<p>A poet feels what we cannot feel — oneness with the sorrows of Eternity, oneness with the joys of Infinity.</p>
<p>They say a poet is born and not made — not true, not true, not true. I am an eye-witness. Many supreme poets at the dawn of their poetry-adventure were nothing but pathetic.</p>
<p>Again, there are many late-bloomer poets. We do not know how and when God's Compassion-Eye descends on them.</p>
<p>True, poetry and poverty are good friends, but poverty has its own joy. To feel that joy, we needs must have a different heartbreath. That heart-breath only a poet can claim. At times, the outer poverty can be an illumining expression of an inner purity.</p>
<p>Poetry and invisibility are dear friends.</p>
<p>Poetry and invisibility are great admirers.</p>
<p>Poetry and invisibility are perfect oneness-heart-flyers, divers and runners.</p>
<p>When a poet sits in deep contemplation, who can say to which realm his thoughts are winging? Lord Byron jests, "Poetry should only occupy the idle." But the idle moments of his own life were not spent uselessly. Even in idleness, the inspiration-promise of dynamism can burst forth. In Don Juan, for example, Byron writes:</p>

<p>"The mountains look on Marathon —<br /> And Marathon looks on the sea;<br /> And musing there an hour alone,<br /> I dream'd that Greece might still be free."</p>

<p>When the present mind enters into the bosom of the past, we tend to glorify the past, but when the present is with us, we treat the present either in a humorous vein or in a contemptuous vein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A poet in history is divine, but a poet in the next room is a joke." — Max Eastman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, inside each human being there is a poet. I fully concur with Joubert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You will find poetry nowhere, unless you bring some with you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must have a subtle poetic touch of our own to appreciate and admire poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry and truth are inextricably linked. The Sanskrit word for poet is <em>kavi</em>. <em>Kavi</em> means "he who envisions". What does he envision? He envisions the truth in its seed-form. Once more I wish to invoke Joubert. His sublime realisation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You arrive at the truth through poetry; I arrive at poetry through truth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been a poet all my life and I have been a dreamer of truth as well. Inside my heart I feel that these two players — the poet and the dreamer — are at once interchangeable and inseparable. That is why I wrote many years ago, at the dawn of my poetry-journey:</p>

<p>Arise, awake, O friend of my dream.<br /> Arise, awake, O breath of my life.<br /> Arise, awake, O light of my eyes.<br /> O seer-poet in me,<br /> Do manifest yourself in me<br /> And through me.</p>

<p>What is my poetry and what do I actually expect from my poetry?</p>

<p>O my poetry,<br /> You are the lotus of my heart.<br /> You bring into my heart<br /> Nectar-Light from Heaven.<br /> When my life flows<br /> With the river of sorrow<br /> With its countless waves,<br /> May your magic touch<br /> Hide me in the waters of liberation-sea.</p>

<p>At this point, I wish to cite the words of a certain poet. History has not preserved his name, but this veil of anonymity only serves to heighten the essential invisibility of a true poet. It is not we, but God, who writes poetry in and through us.</p>

<p>"Each time you pick a daffodil<br /> Or gather violets on some hill<br /> Or touch a leaf or see a tree,<br /> It's all God whispering,<br /> 'This is Me.' "</p>

<p>Something of tremendous importance in my life I wish to share with you. I cannot help reproducing a few momentous words from India's greatest poet Rabindranath Tagore's poem "Fruit Gathering":</p>

<p>"To the birds You gave songs, the birds<br /> gave You songs in return.<br /> You gave me only voice, yet asked for<br /> more, and I sing.</p>
<p>#+ENDVERSE"</p>
<p>Being both a prose-mind-writer and a poetry-heart-writer, I have made a supreme discovery in my own life: every time there is a competitive race between my prose-mind and my poetry-heart to arrive at God's Golden Palace, my poetry-heart invariably wins. How and why? Because, unlike my prose-mind, my poetry-heart sees invisibility's reality-existence-life.</p>
