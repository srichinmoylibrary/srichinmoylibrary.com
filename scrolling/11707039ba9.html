  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Spiritually, is the world going forward or backwards?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Spiritually, is the world going forward or backwards?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Twenty years ago the world was not ready for some things, but now the world is ready for them. Look at the way modern science has improved outer facilities over the past fifty years! The same kind of progress has been made in the spiritual world. One hundred or two hundred years ago, it was so difficult for spiritual seekers to get the experiences that you people get. The kind of experiences it took people years to get during the time of the Vedic Seers — experiences they tried for and cried for and shed bitter tears for — in the twentieth century people get in perhaps a few days or a few months. In the past it took so long to make a little progress or to get an iota of peace. But now, as Sri Aurobindo wrote, spiritual figures are coming who are infinitely more powerful than the Vedic Seers. So the world is progressing, progressing. Then again, some Masters of the past like Krishna and others not only reached the Highest but became the Highest.</p>
<p>In general, modern-day seekers have many opportunities that seekers of the past did not have. Now if you want to get inspiration by praying and meditating with hundreds of people, you get in your car and drive to church. In the days of the Vedic Seers, where could they find thousands of people meditating and praying, such as we find at our peace concerts? If many people are aspiring together most sincerely, there is often more intensity than if one person is doing it alone. In the tug-of-war against ignorance, if on one side there are ten or twelve people, there will be more strength. Some of the seekers may be weak, but even their little strength helps you have a better meditation. Again, if somebody is weak and you waste your time thinking of him or her in a negative way, when the time comes for you to pull hard and use all your strength, you cannot.</p>
<p>So there are advantages and disadvantages today; but on the whole, it is much easier today than in the past. Again, the seekers of the past had more intensity and more aspiration. Today there are more distractions; we have wonderful friends like television and other things! Now we have more outer facilities, but they offer no spiritual benefit.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do you mean when you speak about our highest meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do you mean when you speak about our highest meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each one has his own standard. My highest meditation may not be as high as somebody else's highest. According to my own standard, today I may have my highest meditation; then tomorrow perhaps my meditation will not be so high, and the day after tomorrow my meditation can be lower than the lowest. When we have our own highest meditation, it is because on that day our love for the Supreme, our devotion to the Supreme and our surrender to the Supreme are most remarkable. Or you can say that God unconditionally showers His Compassion on us that day, and that is why we have such love, devotion and surrender. Or perhaps God wants to do something in and through us on that day, and He finds us ready to accept His Compassion.</p>
<p>When the outer world is tempting us or beckoning us, we have to remember these happiest moments. It was because of the things that we chose in our life — our love, devotion and surrender to God's Will — that we got the highest bliss. So if we can remember that bliss when unaspiring forces are attacking us or we are allowing ourselves to be attacked by them, then we will be inspired to resist these hostile forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we lose our God-realisation when we try to reveal or manifest it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we lose our God-realisation when we try to reveal or manifest it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First comes God-realisation. Inside your heart-garden you see a most beautiful flower — the God-realisation-flower — and you become that flower. Then you bring it out of your central being and reveal it to the world, not to show off, but in order to offer the beauty and the fragrance of your heart-flower to others.</p>
<p>Some people, after realisation, do not want to reveal God's Light because it is so difficult. They say, "Who cares whether others believe that there is a most beautiful flower inside my heart? If they do not believe that I have divine peace, which they lack, then I do not have to show them." They also say, "Who knows? While revealing or manifesting God's Light, I may lose it."</p>
<p>But others want to share the peace and light that they have inside because they feel that others will be miserable without it. This is the heart's generosity and magnanimity of those daring souls who try to reveal and manifest God. They are not afraid of losing their inner wealth. They feel, "If I only possess something, then definitely I can lose it because my possession is separate from me. If there is a difference between my existence and my realisation, then naturally I can lose my realisation. But if I have become what I was longing for, then how can I lose it? What I have, I can lose; but what I am, I cannot lose."</p>
<p>Again, it is possible to have an impermanent realisation. When Arjuna got a vision of the Krishna Consciousness, he had not actually achieved God-realisation, so it did not last. In the case of one very great spiritual Master, at first the Krishna Consciousness used to come and disappear. It took twenty-eight years before the Master declared that the Krishna Consciousness had descended fully into his personality. But once you truly realise the Supreme Consciousness, then it can never go.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How should we deal with our defects?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How should we deal with our defects?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning, all the defects that we have we consciously or unconsciously cherish. Then, when we become wise, we feel so sad that we cherished these weaknesses. But even when we want to overcome our weaknesses, we feel helpless. This is the time when we need determination, which has to come through God's Grace.</p>
<p>Everything has to happen step by step. In the beginning, unconsciously or consciously we are cherishing all our weaknesses, which come in the form of temptation. Then we realise that these defects are no good and we separate ourselves from them. We do not want to be insecure; we do not want to be jealous. We do not want to have doubt, impurity and so on. Then we decide that we must conquer these weaknesses. At that time we cannot be relaxed; we have to be fully determined. And where does this determination come from? Its source is God's Compassion. So ultimately we have to go to the Source, God's Compassion, to get the determination to conquer all our defects.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always say that man writes prose, but it is God who writes poetry in and through man. In poetry, each word carries us into the Unknowable, where there is tremendous joy. We may think that when we enter into the Unknowable, we will be totally lost. But we are not lost; we are flying.</p>
<p>Poetry is intuitive, so we should not try to understand it. It is not the mind we need in order to derive joy, but the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the relationship between eagerness and perseverance?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the relationship between eagerness and perseverance?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Eagerness expedites everything; it goes faster than the fastest. With eagerness we can climb up the Himalayas. But sometimes eagerness gives up when it meets obstacles and hurdles in life. With all eagerness we try something once, twice, three times, and then we give up. We approach somebody to ask for this or that, but after two or three attempts we feel it is beneath our dignity to approach that person again. Then we fail. But if perseverance comes to join eagerness, then we are saved.</p>
<p>When somebody succeeds, others may say, "Oh, he was lucky." But it is not luck. Previously, this person may have failed over and over again; many times he may have been unlucky to the extreme. But unlike others, he did not give up, and then finally he succeeded.</p>
<p>Many people are eager, but after two days their eagerness disappears. Two days is more than enough for them. If they do not succeed in two days, they will bring me the report: "I tried so hard, but it cannot be done." To succeed, we have to maintain our eagerness day after day. Eagerness can move mountains. But if eagerness cannot do something, then perseverance and patience are needed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I not criticise others and what can I do when others criticise me? Sometimes I get very mad.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I not criticise others and what can I do when others criticise me? Sometimes I get very mad." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When somebody criticises you, think of that person as an insect or worm and feel that you are the strongest and largest elephant. Since you are larger than the largest, you do not have to pay any attention to a little insect or worm. Vivekananda used to say that the elephant is going to the market for bananas and the dogs are barking. The elephant does not pay any attention to the dogs; he just goes to the market and eats bananas to his heart's content. So when others criticise you, you have to convince yourself that you are infinitely stronger than the criticism that you are getting.</p>
<p>When you are inspired to criticise someone, immediately feel that what is disturbing you in the other person is some weakness that he has. Feel that the wrong thing that he or she is doing arises out of some deplorable weakness. Then try to feel that your criticism of the other person is only increasing his weakness and making it worse.</p>
<p>Also, you have to feel that your criticism is causing all kinds of ailments inside the other person. Then try to pull these ailments into your own system — into your hands or legs or head. Immediately you will say, "My God, it is so painful, so painful!" Then you will see how much suffering you are causing that person. Or imagine that your words of criticism are like an arrow that you have hurled at the other person, and now his entire being is bleeding. When you see him bleeding, your sympathetic oneness will make you feel miserable. It is the same kind of sympathetic oneness that Lord Buddha felt when he picked up the bird that had been wounded with an arrow.</p>
<p>When you identify yourself with the other person's suffering, you will feel, "No matter how imperfect and useless he is, I have no right to cause this kind of suffering in him. I have come into the world to establish my oneness with others and not to destroy others with my criticism." Then your heart of oneness will make you stop criticising the other person. These ideas I am giving you are very practical.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is to feel that your criticism of the other person, which you are cherishing in your being, is a very heavy load. Also, the other person's criticism of you is another heavy load that that person has thrust upon you. How can you move or even breathe if you are carrying two heavy loads on your shoulders? What you have to do is get rid of both loads. You have to cast them aside so that you can run the fastest towards your destination.</p>
<p>Here is still another way. Each time you criticise someone, feel that you have created a black spot on the moon of his heart. By diminishing the beauty of his heart's inner moon, you can never get real joy. Also, you have to feel that if you criticise him, he also will criticise you and ruin the beauty of your inner moon. By destroying one another's inner beauty, neither one of you can be happy. So you have to feel that your happiness can come only with the other person's happiness; it has to be simultaneous. If you do not darken his moon, he will not darken yours, and both of you will be happy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes the world lowers my consciousness.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes the world lowers my consciousness." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is why people remain inside the Himalayan caves. As soon as they come to the village to have a glass of milk or a few fruits, they say their consciousness descends. So they are ready to remain without milk or fruit and give their body to God. But that is not our philosophy. We feel that meditation and the spiritual life are like a boat. Because we are in the boat, we are not affected by the water. If our meditation is really solid, if we can meditate soulfully and powerfully for two hours each day, then definitely the power of our meditation will keep us safe.</p>
<p>But during meditation if we think of tomorrow's breakfast or of who insulted us, then that kind of meditation will be useless. The clock will say that we have meditated for three hours, but during those three hours we have gone to so many peculiar lands and mixed with so many people! If we count how many thoughts we had during our meditation, we will be shocked. So our highest meditation may not be enough. It may be the highest for us, but it is not the kind of silent meditation that advanced seekers have, not to speak of spiritual Masters. If I am a pole vaulter, it is not enough to reach my highest; I have to reach Olympic standard or world champion standard. I have to come to a certain height.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you realise God, at that time you will see that everything was unconditional from God. Why did you get up at six o'clock to pray and meditate, whereas your friends and acquaintances did not? It was because something within you responded to God's Wish or God's Will. God was able to inject His Will into you, whereas someone else was not receptive enough. The moment you feel God's Will operating in and through you, at that time you are responsible to do prayerfully and soulfully what God asks. If you do not do it prayerfully and soulfully, then only will you be blamed.</p>
<p>God will not blame you if you do not succeed, but God will definitely blame you if you do not try cheerfully, soulfully and self-givingly. God will blame you only if you do not try with a divine, self-giving spirit. You are responsible only for making the journey with the right attitude; you are not responsible if you do not meet with success. Success and failure are at His Feet, and you have to offer the results happily and prayerfully to Him.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Suppose you expected something to happen in your own way; you worked very hard for it, but it did not take place. Let us say you expected your daughter to pass her driving test, but she has failed very nicely. With so much hope, eagerness and joy you taught her. If you want to do the spiritual thing, when she fails you have to place at the Feet of God the same amount of energy or feeling that you had when you were hoping that she would succeed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important is common sense?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important is common sense?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Common sense is wisdom. Suppose I see a flame. It is so beautiful that I want to touch it. But common sense tells me that if I touch it, then definitely I will burn my hand. So we start with common sense, but then afterwards we have to go beyond common sense, using whatever wisdom we have got from our past lives or from earlier in our present life. Then we come to a certain stage or height where we see that common sense no longer works. So from there we have to go forward and upward until we are far, far beyond the domain of common sense.</p>

 <p>
SCA 296-304. Questions asked in April and May of 1995.</p>
<h2>Question: You often tell us the story of when Lord Krishna asked Arjuna the colour of some fruit on a nearby tree. Each time Arjuna said it was one colour, Krishna said it was a different colour, and immediately Arjuna changed his opinion to agree with Krishna. When we are dealing with you, how can we know when we should agree with you and when we should offer our own personal opinion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A spiritual Master deals with many, many planes of consciousness. There is a plane of consciousness where earthly realities do not exist as such. If you say that something is blue or red, you are describing the earthly reality. But realities in the higher worlds are not like that; they entirely depend upon God or the cosmic gods. Lord Krishna knew that on the earth-plane the fruits that Arjuna was seeing had a particular colour. But he wanted Arjuna to go to a higher plane where fruits do not even exist, where the tree itself does not exist. On that plane, all that exists is oneness with God's Will. For Arjuna, Lord Krishna was the embodiment of God. So, to reach this higher plane, what Arjuna needed was oneness with Lord Krishna's Will.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Krishna contradicted himself, Arjuna agreed with him. If Arjuna had been an ordinary human being, he would have said, "How many times do I have to agree with you? You corrected me and I agreed with you. Now why are you changing your mind again? What kind of man are you?" But Arjuna did not do that. He showed his obedience and also tremendous patience. All spiritual people have to go through this kind of examination.</p>
<p>To you, Arjuna may appear stupid because he continually changed his opinion. But Arjuna was not a fool. He was not as well-educated as his brother Yudhishthira, but he was far better educated than many people of his day, including Bhima, his other brothers, his cousins and so on. But Arjuna realised that he had to go beyond both form and formless to be one with Lord Krishna. Arjuna's prayer was, "Lord, I want to be one with You. I want to see through Your Eyes; I want to feel with Your Heart." Some people are clever. They say this prayer but continue to see with their own eyes and feel with their own heart. But Arjuna was not one of those; for him, this prayer was not mere words. He knew that Lord Krishna was a God-figure. That is why he made the promise, "Lord, from now on, I will make full surrender to You and become one with Your Will."</p>
<p>This kind of oneness also exists in the ordinary human world. A Bengali mother will teach her child the word <em>phul</em>, which means 'flower'. But a small child often is unable to pronounce it properly. He says, <em>phu, phu!</em> and does not use the 'l' sound. Even after twenty times he still says, <em>phu, phu.</em> The mother sees that by saying <em>phu</em>, the child is getting tremendous joy. So, if her heart is all oneness, she also starts saying <em>phu</em> to make the child happy. Her love for her child is infinitely more important to her than the correct pronunciation of the word. Her mother's love exists one hundred per cent on the human level, and it is so strong that she surrenders to the child's way of speaking. Sometimes twenty or thirty years later, after their children have grown up, you find Bengali mothers still using those wrong words that they learned from their children! Still they are getting so much joy from these childish words. This is called love between two human beings on the ordinary human plane.</p>
<p>On the human level, if the mother will call a flower <em>phu</em> to please her small child, on the divine level can the disciple not also surrender, out of his heart's love, to the Master's way of seeing reality? If the Master says, "One plus one equals four," ordinary humans will say, "The Master is obviously an idiot. I do not want to be associated with him." But the true disciple will say, "My Master is an ocean of love, light and delight. If he says that one plus one equals four, then he must be correct." The disciples who insist that one plus one equals two are correct in mathematics, but spiritually they are millions and billions of miles away from the supreme truth.</p>
<p>On the human level, if you flatter a small child and agree with him, then the child will go into the kitchen and bring you some delicious food to eat. If you do not agree with him, he is not going to bring you such nice food. Sometimes God acts exactly like a child. By listening to yourself, you will get some satisfaction, certainly. But will you get your Master's ocean of love and light? Who is going to give it to you? The one with whom you did not agree?</p>
<p>The problem is that each and every human being has formulated certain ideas on the mental plane. But a spiritual Master cares not for your mental ideas; he cares only for how much oneness you have established with him. When you agree with him, he gives you such a smile, such affection, such blessings. No matter how certain your mind is, it cannot give you that kind of smile, that kind of affection or blessings. So you have to make a comparison. See what you can get from your own mind-room and what you can get from your Master's heart-room. By agreeing with the Master, you will be able to get infinitely more of the Master's inner wealth than by remaining with your own limited mental conception of truth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: During the Battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna got down from the chariot to fight even though he had taken a vow not to fight at all. I was wondering what this tells us about Krishna&#039;s personality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: During the Battle of Kurukshetra, Krishna got down from the chariot to fight even though he had taken a vow not to fight at all. I was wondering what this tells us about Krishna&#039;s personality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When Arjuna saw Vishma advancing towards him on the battlefield, he said to Krishna, "We lost our father when we were quite young, and Vishma became our father. Such affection, such love he had for us! Is there anything that we would not have done for him? He is so dear to me. I cannot fight him."</p>
<p>Krishna told Arjuna, "He is already dead in the inner world. You have to fight him!" Still Arjuna could not bring himself to fight with his grandsire; so Krishna came out of the chariot with his discus. When Krishna decided to fight, he said, "My love for my Arjuna is infinitely more important to me than my so-called promise. People will say that I am not a man of my word. I do not care. I want to prove that my love for my Arjuna is infinitely more important than preserving honour in the eyes of the world. I am prepared to go against the ordinary light of morality in order to win the victory for Arjuna."</p>
<p>When Vishma saw that it was Krishna himself who had come to fight him, he came running to be killed. He said, "My Lord, my Lord, I know who You are! If You kill me, I will be the happiest person. On the one hand, I am so sad that You are breaking Your Promise. But again, I am so glad that I will die by Your Hand. Kill me, kill me! I am dying to die by Your Hand!"</p>
<p>Then Arjuna said, "No, no, I am ready to fight!" He pulled Krishna back into the chariot and fought Vishma with utmost determination. At last, Vishma lay dying, and Arjuna brought water to his grandsire. When Arjuna saw that Vishma was shedding tears, he said to Krishna, "Our grandfather did not do anything wrong. He was so good, so divine. Why does he have to suffer? Why are there tears in his eyes?"</p>
<p>Krishna said to Arjuna, "Why are you asking me? Ask him! He will tell you." So Arjuna asked his grandfather, "Please tell me why you are crying, Grandfather. In our kingdom, there is nobody as divine as you. It was you yourself who told us how to kill you. Who else on earth would have been so noble? But now that your death is fast approaching, why are you crying? Are you afraid of death?"</p>
<p>Vishma replied, "You fool! I am weeping not because I am afraid of death, but because the Pandavas have suffered so much. Krishna, the Lord of the Universe, was all the time with you and for you. So how is it that you have suffered so much? I do not understand the Lord's Game. That is why I am shedding tears."</p>
<p>Krishna answered him, "This is my creation. You will never be able to understand it. My mystery is unfathomable."</p>
<p>The <em>Mahabharata</em> is sweeter than the sweetest and, at the same time, deeper than the deepest. On the mental level, we cannot justify many of the things that Krishna did. But, again, his divinity is all the justification that is needed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just before the battle began, Yudhishthira did something most remarkable. He came and stood in front of the enemy and said, "If anybody from your side wants to join us, now is the time. We shall be very happy to have you."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, one of Duryodhana's own brothers came running and said, "My brothers are very bad. I want them to be killed! Please accept me on your side." This brother's name was Yuyutsu. He was born not to Gandhari but to a Shudra woman. At the end of the Battle of Kurukshetra, he was the only brother to remain alive.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If someone is connected with a particular god or goddess, does that god or goddess show special concern for that person?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If someone is connected with a particular god or goddess, does that god or goddess show special concern for that person?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Provided the person leads a good and spiritual life, concern is definitely there and these cosmic gods and goddesses will help. In a school, not all the students are of the same standard; the teacher has to teach every Tom, Dick and Harry. But if there are some excellent students who give the teacher joy, he gives those students more attention. Privately, he tells them, "Come to my house. I will teach you more." But a third-class student he will teach only during school hours. In the spiritual life also, if somebody is a good seeker, that person will get more attention and inner concern from the cosmic god or goddess who is ruling his destiny. But again, the cosmic god has only limited authority over the person; only the Supreme has full authority.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the cosmic gods and goddesses will help the seeker in so many ways when the seeker is praying and meditating. Then, when they see that the seeker is going beyond their height or domain, at that time they stand against him. First they feed you and feed you; then they stand in your way. But if you can go beyond them, they again become extremely close to you and try to help because they see that you have direct contact with the Absolute.</p>
<p>Again, if one has a spiritual Master, the cosmic gods do not get involved. Because the spiritual Master keeps direct contact with the Highest, the Absolute Supreme, on the seeker's behalf, the cosmic gods or goddesses become like dear relatives. With relatives we do not keep daily contact. Once a month or once in six years we may see them. But with our father and mother we keep contact every day. So our spiritual Master is the one with whom our soul has to keep a daily connection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy</em>: Nobody wants somebody else to go beyond him. The Puranas are flooded with stories of Parvati's jealousy and insecurity. She is a cosmic goddess; people worship her. But every second Parvati is dying for more beauty or cursing someone! Look at her human aspect! Again, we pray to Parvati for our illumination, for our liberation, for everything.</p>
