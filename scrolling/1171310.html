 <p>
SCA 831-878. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions about angels and fairies on 23 April 1995 in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we enjoy the company of angels?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to enjoy the company of angels, one has to be extremely sweet, pure and subtle. Sweetness is what angels like most. There are many aspects of God that we like. At different times we like God's Compassion or God's Forgiveness or God's Beauty. Very often we think of God's Power. But mostly when we think of God, His Compassion aspect comes forward. We call Him 'God the Merciful'.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we think of an angel, there are two qualities that immediately come to mind: sweetness and brightness. Sweetness in brightness and brightness in sweetness are the predominant angelic qualities. If we can also have that sweetness, brightness and subtlety, then definitely we can be in the midst of the angels.</p>
<p>Even in an ordinary family, mothers often speak about their children by saying, "He is an angel," or "She is an angel." They are not thinking of their children's mental capacities or other talents at that time. They are only thinking of their sweetness. As soon as we think of an angel, we imagine someone who is sweet, delicate, subtle and bright. This is the angelic touch.</p>
<p>Angels always like brightness in nature. Fairies, on the other hand, like naturalness. Anything that is natural fairies like. Most of the fairies wear white, while angels wear brilliant, bright colours. Angels are usually from higher planes, while fairies have freer access to Mother Earth. If you think of a tree, angels are like the higher branches, whereas fairies are like the branches that are only a little higher than the ground. They are branches of the same life-tree, but the fairies are like lower branches and angels are like the high, higher, highest branches.</p>
<p>Angels can come to earth if they want to visit people or see some people who are very dear to them. Angels can take the form of a relative and come to someone who may be going to die in a few hours. At such times angels can act as the direct representative of the divine force to take somebody into the other world. When somebody is about to die, we often hear them say that an angel has come. But fairies do not or cannot do that kind of thing. Fairies deal mostly with children, whereas angels deal with all human beings irrespective of age.</p>
<p>Angels also like children very much, but in terms of receptivity, elderly people receive more blessings from angels because they are more conscious of the angels' divinity. Children do not know what divinity is, so in that respect their receptivity is missing. Elderly people get more benefit when they think of an angel or meditate on an angel — they are filled with joy. Children may hear all about angels from their parents and they may get joy by hearing the word, but they have no idea how angels can help them in their daily lives.</p>

But why do fairies associate with people?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It seems that angels come to be of some kind of service. But why do fairies associate with people?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels love God, and some want to serve God's creation consciously. They say to God, "I want to serve my brothers and sisters on earth. I want to be of some help to them. My brothers and sisters are suffering, and they are not conscious of who You are. Since I am conscious of who You are, let me go and help them."</p>
<p>Fairies come to show us that there are other worlds and these worlds are full of beauty and light. When fairies do something, there is tremendous charm in it.</p>
<p>It is like two magicians. One magician has a very simple, cheap wand and another magician has a very expensive, golden wand. Similarly, angels are full of brilliance, whereas fairies are natural and simple. Fairies can never be complicated. Angels have so much brightness and splendour in them, but they can be very, very complicated.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are angels very large?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are angels very large?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, angels are not large, but fairies can be. When we use our ordinary eyes, fairies can be huge. Angels are light. Most of them are tall and proportionate, but fairies are not like that.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies have more control on earth. If fairies want to do something in and through someone on earth, they can. They get results on the practical plane. Angels also get results, but they are on the inner plane, the subtle plane. The angelic touch is much higher and deeper than that of a fairy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels will have more trouble than ordinary people because the world is so undivine, so gross, so unreceptive.</p>
<p>I have seen some girls in the acting line who were angels or fairies once upon a time. But then they became corrupted by the outer world; they got married ten times and this sort of thing. They came from the angel world to teach mankind to aspire. But it is like a deer coming and telling an elephant to go up. The elephant is so huge that it just grabs the deer. Or it is like a beautiful bird that comes down and asks us to fly. As soon as it comes, we grab the bird and clip its wings. The bird comes to inspire us to go up and fly in the sky, but we do not even allow it to fly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies can be good. Again, fairies can be mischievous or tricky, while angels are not like that. Fairies do help human beings. But angels, as I said, have more brightness, more compassion, more depth, more maturity. Fairies are like children; they break more than they build. That is their joy. Angels do not believe in breaking. They believe in only making things luminous, more luminous, most luminous.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can come to anybody. They are not the sole monopoly of Christianity. Christianity talks about angels, but so do other religions. An angel can also take the form of a deity, and a deity can take the form of an angel if they wish to have certain angelic qualities.</p>
<p>Here I am not referring to Kali or Durga or the cosmic gods and goddesses of a very high order. Angels take the form of ordinary deities who have compassion, affection and concern.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All angels cannot have the same beauty, but all of them do have wings. Angels are always dynamic. They are constantly moving, whereas fairies can be very lethargic. Fairies are no match for angels in this respect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because children are more connected with fairies, to give the children more joy, fairies are shown wearing bright colours. But it is just the opposite. In general we can say that children deal more with fairies, whereas when we speak of angels, we imagine our Grandfather-God is coming to bless us via an angel. When somebody is dying, we say that an angel came. At that time we do not say that a fairy came. When you are sick, do you ever think that a fairy will come and help you, that a fairy will take your sickness away? Never! You do not think that a fairy will come and take your headache.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A spiritual Master is much higher than an angel. Even a yogi is higher. But angels are much higher than fairies. In terms of spiritual height, you can say that fairies are like nurses and angels are like doctors. Again, nurses know a few things that doctors know. Sometimes it is beneath the dignity of the doctors to give injections. The nurses will actually give better injections than the doctors who have got higher than the highest degrees. By doing it so many times, they have become expert. So one is in theory, the other is in practice. Again, nurses are nurses. When we are treated by the nurse, shall we say that we were treated by the doctor?</p>
<p>Fairies have a more magical touch than angels. When you think of an angel, usually the angel is coming to do something really serious — a life and death matter. With fairies, one does not think of life and death.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our Indian theory is that each human being has a special god of his own, apart from the highest God. As there are many human beings, so there are also many gods and goddesses. Here in the West, it is said that there are as many angels as human beings. But you cannot say the same about fairies. An angel is like a direct part of our aspiration. You can also say that they are an express portion of divinity. Angels have more light than fairies. When something serious occurs, when it is a matter of life and death, if you think of a fairy, nothing will happen. But if you think of an angel, because of their infinite affection or compassion, they will come and be of real help to you.</p>
