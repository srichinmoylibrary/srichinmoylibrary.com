<p>I go to my Mother India for affection, compassion and illumination, and I do get these divine realities in boundless measure in the inner world. But, unfortunately, the outer experiences that I get in India are extremely painful. Alas, my life-boat plies between the confusion-shore and the deception-shore!</p>

<p>From New York to London everything went well. The stewardesses were extremely kind to me in every way. I can give them one hundred out of one hundred. The funniest thing is that they served pizza for vegetarians. They gave me three pieces and they wanted to give me more! Plus it was real pizza.</p>
<p>In London, I went to transfer for the flight to Bombay. Again, it was British Airways, and I got the upper deck once more, so I was very happy.</p>
<p>When I went to my seat, there was an Indian lady, middle-aged, on my right. It was executive class, so there was plenty of room between the seats. I put my small bag in front of me.</p>
<p>The lady said to me, "You cannot do that!"</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I am not feeling well, and I need plenty of room to stretch my legs."</p>
<p>The bag was right in front of me, and she wanted to put her legs there!</p>
<p>A few minutes later she called the stewardess. "I need a couple of pillows," she said. She already had one pillow, and so the stewardess brought her another. Then their fight started.</p>
<p>The lady, who was Gujrati, said, "I asked you for a couple of pillows, and you have only brought me one!"</p>
<p>"But you already have one pillow," the stewardess pointed out.</p>
<p>"I am not feeling well, so I need lots of pillows," said the lady.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the Gujrati lady called the stewardess again. She said to the stewardess, "I need aspirin. I am not feeling well."</p>
<p>"Only aspirin?" the stewardess asked. The stewardess brought two aspirin, and gave her one of them.</p>
<p>The lady cried, "I need four at least!"</p>
<p>The stewardess told her, "I am not authorised to give you four. I can give you at most two. I gave you one, and I am giving you one more."</p>
<p>"No!" said the lady. "You have to give me as many as I want."</p>
<p>"No, I cannot do that," the stewardess said, and she left.</p>

<p>Can you imagine? The story never ends, and the plane had not yet even started! I was sitting on the aisle, and the Gujrati lady was sitting on the other side near the window. My left foot was in the aisle. It was aching, so I was shaking it a little.</p>
<p>The lady saw me, and she said, "You are not allowed to do that. I am sick, and you are shaking the whole plane." She was on my right side, and my foot was nowhere near her.</p>
<p>O God, O God, we were still on the ground and I was shaking the whole plane! There were only sixteen seats in our section. I stood up to see if there were any empty seats, but there were none, so I surrendered to my fate. Then I was obedient. I did not shake my foot anymore.</p>

<p>In executive class the seats recline so far back; it is not like economy class where the seats go back two inches. An elderly man, bald-headed like me, was sitting right in front of the Gujrati lady. He pressed the button and went back, leaving a very small gap between his seat and this lady. She also could have reclined her seat in the same way; everybody can do it.</p>
<p>The man was near me, so I could easily see him. He fell asleep in five minutes, and he started snoring very loudly, perhaps deliberately-God knows! The lady began shaking his seat, and then afterwards she started shaking his shoulder, saying, "Stop snoring!" I was sure that he was ignoring her; otherwise, the way she was shaking his shoulder, he would have been furious. But he stayed fast asleep.</p>
<p>Again she called the stewardess. This time her complaint was, "He is snoring! He is making so much noise and not allowing me to sleep."</p>
<p>I buried my head in my palms and said, "O God, what am I going to do?" There was no seat empty.</p>
<p>Then a man came to me and said he was the head of the stewards. He asked, "How do you pronounce your name? Do you say Ghosé or Ghose?"</p>
<p>I said, "My name is Ghose, not Ghosé."</p>
<p>He pulled me by the left shoulder and whispered, "Are you comfortable?"</p>
<p>Very quietly I told him, "She is torturing me." He said, "Let me go downstairs." Downstairs also there was executive class. He came back and said, "There are three seats empty. Where is your bag?"</p>
<p>He carried my small bag and took me downstairs. Then I got excellent treatment. Three seats were empty and nobody was there to bother me. Behind the seat of the person in front of you there is a television screen. You just pull it out and you can watch whatever is on the big screen. And the seats are so comfortable. So I was the happiest person, and I was far, far away from that crazy lady!</p>

<p>At the end of the flight, when I was gathering up my things, I remembered that I had left a small bag upstairs. It had some candy bars and newspapers inside. When I approached my former seat, the Gujrati lady asked, "Where have you been?"</p>
<p>I just smiled at her. Then she said, "Shame on you, shame on you!"</p>
<p>That was her parting blessing.</p>

<p>When I reached Bombay, I wanted to go to a hotel nearby named Samraj. I was going to be in Bombay for three hours, and I wanted to stay in the hotel for two hours. At the airport I asked a hotel representative, "How much do you charge for two hours?"</p>
<p>The man said, "Eight hundred rupees."</p>
<p>I asked, "For half a day there is no special rate? I will be there only for two hours."</p>
<p>He told me, "No, this is our fixed rate."</p>
<p>I decided to go anyway. I asked, "How long does it take to get there from here?"</p>
<p>The man said, "It takes only three minutes."</p>
<p>"Then please take me," I told him.</p>
<p>He said, "Just wait, the coach is coming."</p>
<p>Five minutes went by, then ten minutes, fifteen minutes, twenty minutes. Finally, I said to the man, "Instead of the coach, let me take a taxi." I was ready to give him money, but he said, "We do not take money here. We only make arrangements for the hotel."</p>
<p>After twenty minutes had passed I got disgusted. I said, "I am going to another travel agency to make arrangements."</p>
<p>He cried, "No, no, no." At that moment, somebody came and said the coach was there. Instead of three minutes, it became twenty minutes!</p>

<p>When I arrived at the hotel, they asked me to pay in advance, so I gave them eight hundred rupees. Then they asked me, "At what time do you wish to leave?"</p>
<p>I answered, "I want to leave this place at three o'clock."</p>
<p>They said, "Oh yes, we shall call you at three o'clock."</p>
<p>I told them three, but I knew that if I left at 3:15, it would also be all right. The plane was due to leave at 4:30. It was only three minutes from there and I had my ticket. In the room I took out my timer. I said, "In case they do not call me, I will use this." So I set the timer.</p>
<p>Then I called my brother to find out how my sister was. He said, "She is still alive. You will be able to see her."</p>
<p>I said, "This is the greatest news I have got." This was the only message I wanted to hear; I was so happy that she was still alive.</p>
<p>Then I phoned up the nursing home. The nurse shouted, "Lily-di, Lily-di, Chinmoy-da is calling you!" Then she took the phone to my sister, and said, "Say something, say something! Say hello at least or call his name."</p>
<p>My sister was not able to do me that favour. She could not speak. I thought, "The boat is sinking. Before I touch the destination, before I reach Pondicherry, she cannot even say hello. She is so sick." I was praying to God: "Since I have taken such trouble to come to see my dearest sister, God, allow me at least to see her."</p>

<p>The two phone calls that I made to Pondicherry from Bombay were not even one minute long. The first time I only asked my brother how my sister was. Then I dialed the nursing home. At the nursing home, my sister did not even come to the phone. But the hotel charged me for four minutes per call. Then I placed a phone call to New York. The hotel operator dialed the wrong number. When I challenged them, they denied it, and before I came downstairs, they changed the number on my bill. I happened to see that on their copy the incorrect telephone number was still there.</p>
<p>So they told me lies. They said that because somebody answered the phone in New York, I had to pay two hundred rupees, even though it was a wrong number. Plus I had to pay more than six hundred rupees for the two calls I made to Pondicherry, which should have been forty or fifty rupees. So in the Bombay hotel, deception started.</p>

<p>The plane to Madras was delayed by an hour and a half. From Madras to Pondicherry it takes three and a half hours if you drive very fast. One of my close friends came to take me. He always comes. He is such a kind friend. He was waiting for me at the airport and he said, "At ten o'clock the nursing home closes. After that they do not allow visitors."</p>
<p>I said, "What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>He said, "I will drive as fast as possible, and Mother will protect us."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, Mother will protect us."</p>
<p>On the way two or three times big lorry trucks unnecessarily blocked us. He used all his Indian mantras, but the trucks did not listen. Whenever he got the opportunity, he drove very fast. Where it says you cannot drive more than 35 miles per hour, he was going very fast.</p>
<p>I said, "Let us hope and hope that we can reach Pondicherry in time."</p>

<p>At five minutes to ten, my friend and I arrived at the nursing home. I forgot that I had knee trouble. There were three staircases inside the building. One was short but the other two were long. I went practically running up the stairs. There were nurses and servants in the hallway and I said, "I have come to see my sister."</p>
<p>They said, "No, it is past ten o'clock."</p>
<p>"My watch says five minutes to ten," I said and I showed them my watch.</p>
<p>They replied, "No, ours says ten o'clock."</p>
<p>I said, "I am coming all the way from America to see my dying sister."</p>
<p>They said, "Come tomorrow at eight o'clock."</p>
<p>I looked around and saw a huge picture of the Mother. With such devotion I looked at her picture, and the Mother saved me. When they saw me with folded hands praying to the Mother, they said, "All right, we have changed our mind. You can be there, but only for two minutes."</p>
<p>I said, "Two minutes is too much. Just allow me to see her."</p>

<p>When they took me into my sister's room, my sister was eagerly waiting for me. As soon as she saw me, she started screaming with joy. There were tears in her eyes. She became hysterical. I placed my hand on her head and started blessing her. She immediately grabbed my hand, pulled it down and placed it on her heart. She pressed my hand against her chest. Both of us were swimming in a sea of tears. She told me that she did not want to live on earth any longer. Now that she had seen me once more, she wanted to go to the other world.</p>
<p>I said, "No, you have to stay on earth. Your soul wants you to stay."</p>
<p>We were together for perhaps three or four minutes. We created a scene! Then they sent a servant to knock at the door to remind me that it was closing time. He was knocking at the door very hard. I opened it and said to him, "There are four patients in this room. All of them are sick. What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He said, "But two minutes are up."</p>
<p>I said, "You could not have come here and whispered?"</p>
<p>When I was leaving, my sister was so happy and, at the same time, she was so miserable that I had to leave her.</p>
<p>The nurses told me again, "Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock you can return."</p>

<p>That night I did not have a wink of sleep. I did not have even one minute's rest. I was extremely tired, but I was so happy to remain awake so that I could go and see my sister and we could have a good talk. I had promised her that I would be there at eight o'clock. The next morning finally arrived. Exactly at eight, I presented myself at the nursing home. I was so eager to see my sister.</p>
<p>One of the nurses said to me, "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>I said, "I was told to come at eight o'clock."</p>
<p>The nurse said, "No, the visiting hours are between four and seven in the afternoon."</p>
<p>I said, "Last night they told me to come back at eight o'clock."</p>
<p>She would not allow me to see my sister. Then I said, "All right, let me see what I can do." I sat on a chair in the hallway for about ten minutes. "O God, is this to be my fate?" I thought.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a lady wearing a sari appeared and said, "Ah, Chinmoy-da, what are you doing? Why are you here? I am Doctor Salila. What are you doing here? You did not go to see your sister today?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am not allowed. Last night I came at five minutes to ten. At first they did not allow me. Finally, with greatest difficulty, they allowed me. Then they told me to come at eight o'clock, but now I cannot go to see her."</p>
<p>The doctor said, "You go and tell them that I am the doctor. Any time you want to come, you can come, and as long as you want to stay, you can stay. I am giving you permission."</p>
<p>I said, "The nurses will not believe me." Then Dr. Salila called one nurse and introduced me, "This is Chinmoy-da. Any time he wants to come, he can come here, and he can stay as long as he wants to."</p>
<p>She is one of the main doctors. There are two doctors: Dr. Datta, who is from Calcutta, and Dr. Salila. Both of them are extremely, extremely, extremely kind to me.</p>

<p>I went to see my sister, and we chatted for about an hour. Then a nurse came and said, "Now we have to bathe her, so you go out for some time."</p>
<p>I said, "I am going to stay outside. Will you kindly inform me when I can come back in?"</p>
<p>The nurse said, "Definitely."</p>
<p>My sister was not the only patient in that room. There were three more patients. The lady right by her on the left side was constantly screaming so loudly: "Yeeah, yeeah."</p>
<p>I asked my sister, "What is wrong with her?"</p>
<p>My sister said, "Somehow she was responsible for her husband's death. She poisoned her husband or she did something, so now she is getting the karma back."</p>
<p>I asked, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>My sister told me, "We hear from people that she was responsible."</p>
<p>While the lady was sleeping, she was quiet. Otherwise, when she was awake at every moment she was screeching very loudly: "Yeeah, yeeah."</p>
<p>Another patient does not sleep at all. The doctor confided to me that this lady is mentally unbalanced. Unfortunately, I had to pass by her to see my sister. On one occasion, the lady said to me, "Is she your sister?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, she is my sister."</p>
<p>Then she said, "How is she? Is she still alive? Then no problem, my mother is in Heaven. My mother will take care of her." Her mother will take care of my sister, and my sister is still alive? All kinds of rubbish things she was telling me. I had to pass by her to see my sister, and she would always say something crazy. This was my experience at the nursing home.</p>
