<p><em>(Krishna's palace. Krishna and Satyavama are together.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: How is it that people think you are full of compassion? I see that you have no compassion at all. Look at your greatest devotee. He is repeating your name so devotedly and so soulfully! But you don't care for him. All he eats is a blade of grass now and then, because there is nobody to feed him.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: Why don't you ask someone to look after him? You have so many admirers and devotees. Why don't you ask someone to bring food to Durvasha every day, so that he can continue his meditating and still have proper food to eat.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: He does not need that kind of food.</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA <em>(becoming angry):</em> He does need it, but you don't supply it.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: No, no. His food is different, entirely different.</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: I am sure that if I take him some proper food, delicious food, right now, he will eat voraciously.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Well, perhaps you are right. You can try it. Go to him on the other side of the Jamuna, and then come back and tell me what he says about the food.</p>

<p><em>(Satyavama, having prepared a most delicious meal, goes to the River Jamuna, and tries to cross it. The Jamuna is a tiny river that is usually knee deep, but when there is a flood or a storm, it has to be crossed in a ferryboat. Satyavama sees that the water is raging like the surges of the sea. The boatman refuses to take her across because of the danger. Satyavama, depressed and angry, returns to the palace!)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: Krishna, I went to cross the river to take food to your dearest disciple, but the river was hostile to me. Do something!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: All right. Go and say this to the river: "If my Lord Krishna has not seen the face of any woman other than me, then calm down."</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: How can I say this? I know how many women friends you have. I cannot say to Jamuna that you have never seen the face of any woman but me. It is all lies! Jamuna will never calm down. You have seen the faces of millions of women. To say that you have only seen my face is ridiculous!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Go. Go and say what I have told you to Jamuna and see what happens.</p>

<p>SATYAVAMA <em>(thinking aloud):</em> I am sure the Jamuna has allowed me to cross just to please Krishna.</p>
<p><em>(She comes to the place where Durvasha is meditating. He is in a high trance, but slowly opens his eyes when she approaches him.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: O Durvasha, I have observed that for many weeks now you have been repeating my Lord's name with deepest devotion, and you have taken almost no food. Today, I have brought you food which I myself have prepared for you.</p>
<p>DURVASHA <em>(still in a meditative mood, touches the feet of Satyavama):</em> Mother, your compassion is food enough for me. Yet I am supremely grateful that you have thought of me and brought me food.</p>
<p><em>(Satyavama has to feed Durvasha herself as he is still in a trance-like state. When he has finished the food, Durvasha bows and touches Satyavama's feet.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Exit Satyavama)</em></p>

<p>SATYAVAMA: O Durvasha, please do something for me. There is no boatman at the river and my Lord is on the other side. I cannot cross because of the storm. While I was coming here it was also stormy, but my Lord made the river subside. But now my Lord is not here. Please tell me what I should do.</p>
<p>DURVASHA: This is very easy, Mother. I will tell you. Go and say this to the river: "If Durvasha has not eaten anything but a few blades of grass for many years, then you must calm down, O Jamuna."</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: You fool! You liar! I have just fed you a most delicious meal with my own hands, and now you are asking me to say this!</p>
<p>DURVASHA: Mother, please tell the river what I have told you. I will come with you.</p>

<p><em>(Krishna's palace.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: Krishna, you are a liar and you have taught your dearest disciple also how to tell lies.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: What lies have we told?</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: You said that you have never looked at any woman's face in your life except mine. How can it be? Millions of women you have seen. We have so many relatives, including your own mother, your sister and many others around us. So how can you say that you have not seen any other woman's face?</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Satyavama, you don't understand my spiritual knowledge. You are my dearest. You and I are one. When I look at any woman, immediately I see your face in that person. All women to me are represented by you. When I look at any woman's face, physically it is different, but according to my inner wisdom, inner light, I see that it is you who are that particular person. You are the Divine Mother and I am the Divine Father. So I see my female part, you, inside everyone. How, then, can I say that I am seeing somebody else? It is you I see in different forms, in different shapes.</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA <em>(satisfied):</em> I see. You are dealing with your universal consciousness. You are the Lord and I am your divine <em>Shakti.</em> But what about this liar Durvasha? He is your devotee. I fed him a delicious meal with my own hands. And immediately afterwards he said that he had not eaten anything but a few blades of grass for several years!</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Dearest Satyavama, all the while you were feeding him, Durvasha was in trance. He always remains in trance. And in trance what he eats is delight, ecstasy. That is his only food. He has practically lost all outer consciousness. On rare occasions he comes down to the earth-consciousness. Most of the time he is in his highest transcendental Consciousness, where he is communing with me. I feed him Peace, Light and Bliss. When he told you that he had taken only blades of grass, he was speaking the truth. He ate your food, true, but he didn't get any taste from the food you gave him. He was only drinking my divine nectar all the time. Before he entered into this rigorous discipline, this austere life, he decided that he would eat only blades of grass after beginning serious meditation. That particular idea is still in his mind, and he still thinks that he is eating only grass and nothing else, for he is not aware of outer things, earthly things. He has lost the consciousness of the outer world. So if you give him delicious earthly food, he gets no more taste from your meal than he gets from grass. That is why he could say that he had not eaten anything other than a few blades of grass for many years.</p>
<p>SATYAVAMA: You have convinced me, my Lord. I am most grateful to you. I withdraw my charges.</p>

<p>ARJUNA: O Krishna, this woman is so poor. Why don't you do something for her? I could not tell her you were Krishna because I did not have your permission. But you can see, Krishna, how she suffers. She has nobody on earth. Her only means of support is her cow. She has only the cow and nothing else on earth. How can she live, Krishna?

<p>KRISHNA: True, Arjuna, you don't understand me. Now listen. She always thinks of the cow. The cow has to be fed; the cow has to be milked; the cow has to be bathed, and so forth. I want her to think only of Me, and when she has nobody on earth, not even the cow, she will think of Me all the time, devoting herself to Me twenty-four hours a day. If her cow were to remain alive, she would linger on earth and constantly think of the cow, and not of me. She would not make as much progress. But since I am now taking her cow, soon the time will be right for me to take her away from this world, and after a few years I will give her a better and more fulfilling incarnation.</p>
<p>ARJUNA <em>(bowing):</em> O Krishna, you are right. You are always right. Your ways are inscrutable, but I see you are always right, perfectly right, once I understand you. You are always right, my Krishna.</p>

<p><em>(A Brahmin and his wife inside their cottage.)</em></p>
<p>WIFE: My Lord, you always speak of your friend, Krishna. If he really is your friend, how is it that you don't go to him and get some money to relieve our poverty? You happened to be a very close friend of his when you were both boys. Now he has become King of Dwaraka, a very opulent, powerful King ruling a vast territory. But your fate is otherwise. You are extremely honest, sincere, moral and spiritual, but you are extremely poor. Sri Krishna is so rich, and you always speak highly of him. Why don't you go to him for help?</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I don't want to ruin our friendship now that I know Krishna is not an ordinary man. He is a King in the outer world, and he is also a King in the inner world. I think of him, meditate on him and pray to him. He gives me much joy, much inner treasure. Although I don't have a lot of money and I do not wallow in the pleasures of riches, inwardly I am very happy. If I take money from him, then perhaps our friendship will come to an end. That is why I don't want to go to him.</p>
<p>WIFE: No, you should go. He is not an ordinary man, and he is very generous. He will give you a large sum of money. And I assure you that he will maintain his same old friendship with you.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I really can't do it. <em>(Pauses.)</em> All right. Since you have been insisting on my going for a long time, I will go there. I will kill two birds with one stone. I will please you by listening to your request, and I will please myself by seeing my intimate childhood friend whom I haven't seen for a long time. I will go and see him, but not to ask for money. I will see him, my Lord Krishna, so I can be filled with inner joy. And at the same time, I will be fulfilling your request that I go to his palace. Give me some food. Krishna, if he is still the same old Krishna, may ask me for something home-made.</p>
<p>WIFE: I have a small quantity of popped rice that you can tie in the corner of your dhoti.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: Thank you. I shall leave for his palace right now.</p>

<p><em>(The Brahmin and Sri Krishna at Sri Krishna's palace.)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA: I am exceedingly glad to see you, my old friend. Please tell me about your present life.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I am very happy, and my wife is very nice. And you, Krishna, you are a Lord now - an inner King and an outer King. Even so, you are showing me the utmost kindness, sympathy and friendship.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: What have you brought from home? I am eager to eat something of yours.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN <em>(aside):</em> Krishna is the King here. He has hundreds of slaves, and his palace is most luxurious. All divine and earthly things are at his command. What can I do? I am too embarrassed to give him this small quantity of popped rice.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Krishna snatches away his popped rice and starts eating.)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA: Delicious, most delicious! For a long time I have not been blessed with this kind of food. I left Brindavan, and now I am King. Here I get food, but it doesn't have in it the real affection, the boundless affection, that is in this food you have brought from your wife. Now that I am in a city, I miss real affection, real concern.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN <em>(aside):</em> How I am enjoying Sri Krishna's presence! Divine Joy, divine Peace, divine Light is pouring forth from him, and I am drinking in his divine Nectar. I am so happy. Oh, now I am really pleased. I have fulfilled my desire, and my wife's desire I have also fulfilled in a way, since I have come to Sri Krishna. But I will not be able to ask my beloved Krishna for earthly wealth. I can't. How can I ask him for earthly things, fleeting things, ephemeral things, when out of his infinite bounty he has given me divine things, eternal things?</p>

<p><em>Amar bhuban tomar charan lagi</em><br /><em>Amar jiban tomar swapan lagi</em></p>


<p>My world is for Your Feet.<br /> My life is for Your Dream.</p>

<p><em>(Suddenly, a heaviness attacks him.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMIN: I am spiritual; that is why I am in a position to cry for divine things. But my wife does not care for spiritual things; she needs earthly things. Perhaps I made a mistake. I ought to have asked Krishna to give her something. She likes candy. I should have asked him to give me some candy for her. I feel sorry, but now it is too late. I don't want to go back to my friend, but I know she will be angry with me. What can I do?</p>

<p><em>(The Brahmin enters his village and approaches his home. Many men and women servants are moving around.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMIN: Oh God! Where is my cottage? Standing where my home, my tiny cottage, was, I see a big building, a huge palace. I see servants and maids. <em>(Looking in.)</em> From here I can see that it is full of expensive furniture, and it is decorated with elaborate ornaments. <em>(Turning to one servant who is passing by.)</em> What happened to the cottage that was here?</p>
<p>SERVANT: Oh, don't you know? The owner is now wallowing in riches.</p>
<p>BYSTANDER: He went to his friend, Krishna, and Krishna gave him all this wealth.</p>
<p>BRAHMIN: Ah! Now I know the whole story. <em>(His wife appears briefly in the doorway, dressed in costly garments and jewels.)</em> Now my wife is decked in a most expensive, beautiful dress, and I see a flood of joy in her face. Hundreds of servants are waiting to attend me. But an inner pang shoots through me. O Lord Krishna, you have deceived me! Now how can I think of you? You pleased me when I was with you. Now you have pleased my wife. But here is temptation. My wife did not care for the spiritual life. Now that she is rich it will be worse; she will never care for it! Perhaps my spiritual life will come to an end as well. I will become involved in these ordinary earthly things, ephemeral glittering things.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly Krishna appears before the Brahmin in a vision.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMIN: O Krishna, feed me only with inner wealth. I want to live in you and receive your inner wealth, not this outer wealth. O my eternal friend, beloved Krishna, keep me inside your heart and feed me with your Compassion, Peace, Light and Bliss. And I pray to you to transform my wife's consciousness so that she will also realise that earthly wealth is no wealth - only inner wealth is worth having.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: My childhood friend, do you think I would betray you? You sought only inner wealth, and I have given you all that I am. Your wife sought outer wealth, and I have given her all that I have. After a while she will get tired of this outer wealth, she will see that it does not satisfy her, and then she too will cry for Light, Peace and Bliss. And then you both will run side by side to your Goal: my Infinity's Breath and my Eternity's Life.</p>
