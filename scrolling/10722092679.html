<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During your meditation, just try to throw your inner and outer existence into my transcendental Consciousness. In the transcendental Consciousness, you do not have to think of anything. You just throw yourself into the sea. Then the sea will feed you with light, peace, bliss and power. But do not expect peace from there, or any particular divine quality. I want to give you something, but when you expect, with your expectation you are binding yourself and you are binding me.</p>
<p>Human expectation is very limited. Suppose you want divine peace. This is wonderful. But when you expect, immediately your mind acts. The mind creates some receptivity inside you and you feel that you have the capacity to receive what you are expecting. But first you have to know that the receptivity that you have in your mind or in the physical is very limited. If you do not expect, but only try to give, then the problem of receptivity comes to the Master. Because you are giving, the Master also wants to give. In order to give, he has to make the vessel; he not only has to make it, but he has to make it very large so that he can give the amount that he wants to give. At that time the Master is bound to give you everything in boundless measure and, at that time, he creates the receptivity in you to receive what he has to offer. So when you meditate, just throw yourself with your utmost aspiration into my Consciousness. Your utmost aspiration should be the feeling of oneness. Feel that you are entering into something which is your true self. You are not entering into a foreign element or foreign person; you are entering into your own highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In silence we possess the highest. If I enter into my own highest trance, at that time nothing will bother me. But the moment we talk, we come down one level. There we see that the earthbound consciousness, the noise and everything else there, is affecting us. If I want to remain in my highest and if I don't want to care about what is happening all around, I can do that. But if I am to be of service to my disciples, then how can I all the time stay there? If somebody is drowning in the water, then naturally the person who is on the shore has to also enter into the water if he wants to be of help. So here also, if a spiritual Master wants to remain in his highest, he has the capacity to do so. But from the highest he cannot help humanity. The students cannot come up to his height, so he has to come down to the level of the students. So I come down to the level of my disciples and teach them how to meditate. If I want to remain in my highest, ignoring them, or if I don't want to be perturbed by the earthly circumstances, noise and so forth, I can easily remain in my highest. But that will not help my fellow beings and my disciples.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should I meditate on my third eye?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should I meditate on my third eye?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes during meditation, individuals concentrate on their third eye. There is nothing wrong with an individual meditating on his third eye. Only you have to know how much preparation you already have. Suppose your third eye opens up untimely and you are not spiritually mature. If you see with your third eye that your mother is going to die tomorrow, you will die today with worries and anxieties. Or your third eye may allow you to see the past. Suppose you see that in the past you badly deceived someone. Now you are such a sincere seeker, but you will feel so miserable because of what you did in the past. You will say, "I have deceived someone, so in this incarnation how am I going to realise God? I am such an undivine person."</p>
<p>But if you have inwardly prepared yourself through gradual meditation on the heart, then if your mother dies tomorrow you will simply say, "Oh, it is God's Will. After all, I have come to surrender my whole existence to God's Will. If He wants to take His daughter, it is His business." And if you had been a thief or a very undivine person in the past, so what? Before you were undivine and now you want to become divine. That is why you have accepted the path of aspiration. This is called illumination, and illumination will save you. If you have this kind of illumination, and it is a living experience in your life, then you can easily meditate on the third eye without any fear. But unless you have illumination as a living experience, it is dangerous to open the third eye. Any serious incident that you see in the future will kill you right in the present. And if you become aware of any unfortunate incident that took place in your past, you will feel extremely miserable and you will not have the heart to go forward.</p>
<p>That is why it is not advisable in the beginning to concentrate and meditate on the third eye. But when your inner being is developed, when you are fully mature and are able to cope with the situations of the past and of the future, then there is nothing wrong with meditating on the third eye. At that time you develop your own power and you make the fastest progress. But right now I tell the beginners not to concentrate on their third eye, because it only creates unnecessary problems.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not because you meditate too much. If you are losing energy while meditating, it means that your meditation is incorrect. If you meditate well, you will gain energy, not lose it. If you do the right thing, naturally you will succeed. But if you meditate in a wrong way, then the meditation fails its own purpose.</p>
<p>Your meditation, unfortunately, is not the way it is supposed to be. You are supposed to meditate on the heart or on your inner being. But you are meditating on the mind or in some other wrong place. That is your problem. Meditation is the only way to gain infinite energy, infinite light and bliss. But if the particular method you use every day is wrong, then, naturally, you will lose energy instead of gaining it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How many times should we meditate per day?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How many times should we meditate per day?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one follows the spiritual path, then one has to meditate at least once a day. This is obligatory; otherwise, it is useless to follow the spiritual path. It is better to meditate at least three times a day, but if it is not possible to feed your soul three times, then please feed it at least once. I am telling this to all of you. At least once a day you have to feed the soul. Feel that the soul is a little child, a divine child. If you don't feed the soul, then it will starve and your divine manifestation will be delayed.</p>
<p>So, if possible, you should meditate at least three times a day: early in the morning, at noon or during your lunch hour, and in the evening. Your morning and evening meditation should be for a longer time, that is to say, half an hour, and your meditation at noon should be for five or ten minutes. If possible, on some days try to meditate seven times for ten minutes or fifteen minutes each time. Seven is an occult number. It carries great significance. But this does not mean that you will only count the number of times and not how soulfully you meditate. You may meditate seven times a day, but it has to be done most soulfully. If you feel that you can meditate soulfully only once, early in the morning, then that is enough. You have to see your real capacity, sincerity, willingness and joy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How long should one meditate? How long can one meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How long should one meditate? How long can one meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual seeker. One athlete may practise running for half an hour while there may be another who can run for only two or three minutes. In the spiritual life also it depends on how far the seeker has advanced. There is no hard and fast rule that we have to meditate for ten or twelve hours. But if we can meditate soulfully and devotedly for one, two or even six hours, we should do it. We should continue to meditate as long as we can do it soulfully and devotedly. But if we meditate beyond our capacity, we will get headaches and have serious problems. Someone might force himself to meditate for twenty-four hours, but what kind of meditation will it be if he does not have the capacity? This will not bring about any satisfactory result. On the contrary, one may become insane.</p>
<p>The best thing is to meditate as long as we can without creating any mental disturbance or any difficulty in our spiritual life. It depends entirely on the capacity of the seeker. It is like developing a muscle. Today we may exercise and become tired after five minutes. After ten days we develop our muscles and we can exercise for half an hour or even more. In the spiritual life there is a spiritual muscle. This spiritual muscle is our inner intensity, our aspiration. How long and how sincerely we can cry for God is our inner muscle.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is better to keep the eyes open. Otherwise, when you keep the eyes closed, very often you go to the other world, the world of sleep. You may think you have had the highest, deepest meditation, but you have only been unconscious. But if you keep your eyes half open, a little open, then you are conscious of the outer world and, at the same time, you are conscious of the inner world. In order to be alert and aware of both worlds, it is always good to keep the eyes a little open. Sometimes if you feel that for two minutes or five minutes you want to keep your eyes closed, there is nothing wrong with that. But if you want to meditate for an hour or two hours while keeping your eyes closed, then I am sorry, but you will only fool yourself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly one can meditate anywhere when one has acquired the capacity. When you become like me you can meditate any time — while driving, while running, while cooking. But right now you are only a beginner. You can meditate in your highest only when you are alone in your room or here at the Centre. You do not have the mastery over your meditation in other places. If you want to do your highest meditation while driving or doing some other serious, important job, you may have an accident because you are not yet an expert or an advanced seeker. While walking, if you try to remain in the higher world, you will jaywalk and then someone will come and take your life away. So I do not advise you to do it. I would like you to meditate as much as possible, but you have to know your capacity. In the car you may do japa. For a short while repeat the name of the Supreme, who is my Guru, your Guru, everybody's Guru. Then wait a few minutes and do it again. In this way you are helping yourself spiritually, and not putting yourself in any danger. But when you become an expert in your meditation, you can do it anywhere. In the beginning, a dancer always makes mistakes. But once he becomes an expert, he can dance anywhere he wants to. Right now it is advisable to see what kind of capacity you have. You have to learn how to do the highest meditation and, at the same time, know what is happening on the earth plane. That is why I ask people during meditation to keep their eyes a little open, so that they can go to the highest while they are retaining their conscious oneness with Mother Earth. Otherwise, they will go up and forget all about this world, and then they are useless here.</p>
<p>I want everybody to become an expert climber. Everybody has to learn how to climb up the tree and bring down the mangoes and share them. If you have the capacity only to go up but not to come down, then you will be stuck there. The best thing is to learn to climb up and climb down. Gradually, gradually you will develop your capacity and then you will be able to do your best meditation anywhere.</p>

<h2>Question: What is the most important thing for the spiritual aspirant to bear in mind?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual aspirant should always bear in mind that he is of God and he is for God. Right now he may be a budding seeker, he may be a beginner; so for him God cannot be or need not be always a living God. Sometimes the aspirant will only be able to imagine God, and sometimes, in spite of his outer efforts, he may not feel the presence of God in himself, and sometimes he may even forget the existence of God. But he has to bear in mind that he has a Source and that Source is Light, boundless Light, infinite Light. He has been wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance for many years and he has not yet come out of ignorance. But he has to feel that his Source is not ignorance; his Source is Light and Delight. He is for that Source and he is making a conscious effort to return to his Source. While returning, he is manifesting God-Delight here on earth. Even now he is in ignorance to some degree, but he is always for God-Life and he is always for God-Light. If he can remember this, then he will feel a constant sense of satisfaction in his life. He will feel Light, more Light, abundant Light, infinite Light in his outer and inner life.</p>

The answer is that illumination will take place. Put illumination in front of your mental vision and feel that slowly, steadily and unerringly you are growing into illumination itself. In this way, imagination will give you the message of reality. Then you have to feel that this reality is nothing other than your true self, and that you have to grow into this reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it necessary to control the mind first in order to receive the divine Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it necessary to control the mind first in order to receive the divine Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we want to control the mind with our human will, then it will be like asking a monkey or a fly not to bother us. The very nature of a monkey is to bite and pinch us; the very nature of a fly is to bother us. To try and control the mind directly is just like trying to straighten the tail of a dog; it is impossible.</p>
<p>The mind needs a superior power to keep it quiet. This superior power is the power of the soul. We have to bring to the fore the Light of the soul, which has unlimited power. In the outer world, when somebody is superior in strength or power, he tries to punish the inferior. But in the spiritual world, the Light of the soul will not torture or punish the mind. On the contrary, it will act like a most affectionate mother who feels that the imperfections of her child are her own imperfections. The heart will feel the obscurity, impurity and darkness of the mind as its own imperfections and, at the same time, the heart will be in a position to offer its Light to the mind. In pin-drop silence it will try to transform the nature of the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This Light actually comes from the soul; it is inside us. The moment we can have free access to our inner being or to the soul, we will see that this Light is coming to the fore to permeate our whole outer existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual seeker. If he has established abundant purity in his entire being, then it is only a matter of months. But if the seeker is not pure enough, then the mantra will take a very long time to produce the desired effect.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the purest Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the purest Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The purest, highest Light is the Light of the Absolute Supreme. This Light can be seen and, at the same time, it can be felt or experienced. When we have established our constant, eternal and inseparable oneness with the Highest, the experience that we get is purest Light. If we have to define the purest Light, we can say that it is nothing but an experience of the Supreme in the Supreme. When we consciously feel our permanent and complete oneness with the Absolute Supreme, we get an eternal and everlasting experience of real, purest Light, and the purest consciousness of the Supreme is put at our disposal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we attain the experience of purest Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we attain the experience of purest Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We achieve this experience on the strength of our inner cry. If we work outwardly for material wealth or power, eventually we achieve these outer things. When we want to do something or achieve something, we have to work for it, Right now our goal is purest Light. In this case, our work is to cry inwardly. We have to inwardly cry like a child for inseparable oneness with the Supreme. The child cries for what it wants, and the mother always comes. No matter where she is, she comes to offer the child whatever it wants. Similarly, when we cry in the inmost recesses of our heart, our request is granted. But everything depends on the sincerity of our inner cry. If our cry is sincere, God is bound to grant it. If we cry inwardly for spiritual things — for Peace, Light, Bliss — then we are bound to achieve these divine qualities.</p>
