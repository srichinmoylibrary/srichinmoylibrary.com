<h2>Question: Should we pay more respect to the divinity inside a man than the divinity inside an animal, or is it all the same?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth everything is evolving. A stone has a soul, but the development of the soul is not so clear, so vivid. Then comes the plant life, the animal life and finally the human life. We are not satisfied even with the human life; we are crying for the divine life. God is everywhere, even in this branch. But in you the soul is infinitely more developed than in this branch. So we have to see where the manifestation of God is more vivid. We have to pay more respect to a human being than to an animal. Again, when we are in the presence of a spiritual man, we show a little more respect to him than to an ordinary human being, because in him we see and feel more development, more manifestation of divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, if the Supreme is in everything, then He must also be in the mind. So why is the mind bad?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, if the Supreme is in everything, then He must also be in the mind. So why is the mind bad?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two minds. One mind is extremely nice, extremely divine, extremely pure. The other mind, which is in the physical, is not so divine and pure. When we say that the mind is not as good as the heart, we are speaking about the mind that is inside the body. This mind does not allow our own heart to become big. Right now you are thinking of me; the next moment you will think of your friends who are somewhere else. The mind thinks of only one person or one thing at a time, and the next moment it goes somewhere else. This mind cannot hold four or five things at a time; it is very limited. It sees one thing at a time and it goes very fast.</p>
<p>Right now the mind that you are using is called the physical mind. If I smile at one of your friends, you will become jealous. The mind will say, "Oh, Guru didn't look at me." But when you use the other mind, the pure mind, you will say, "After all, so-and-so is my friend. Why have I to become jealous when she and I are one?"</p>
<p>The heart is all oneness. So, if you remain inside the heart, you will not feel jealousy. If I smile at someone else, immediately you will say, "Oh, she is my dearest friend." Then you will have no suffering, no anxiety, no doubt, no jealousy. You are a sincere girl, so try always to have the heart that tells you, "We are all one, we are all one." If I look at your mother and bless her, you will be very happy that I am blessing your mother and nobody else. Similarly, if you feel that these other girls in the Centre are also like your mother — members of your own family — then you won't feel miserable in the mind. The mind makes you feel that your spiritual sisters and brothers do not belong to you. But the heart makes you feel that everybody belongs to you. That is why the heart is better. Remain in the heart, pray in the heart, meditate in the heart. Then you will see that everybody is yours and you are everybody's.</p>
<p>I am trying to simplify the matter; otherwise it will become a philosophy. God is in everything. God is also inside a tiger, but will you stand in front of the tiger? No. The tiger will just eat you up. You have to know that the God that is inside the tiger is not to be worshipped by you right now. God is inside everything, but in some things He is manifested to a greater degree. You are a human being and I am also a human being. You eat rice, you eat bread, you eat pizza; I also eat these things. But there is a little difference between you and me; that is why you have come to me. So, the Supreme is in the mind also, but in the heart He is more accommodating, He is broader, He is kinder and more compassionate. Again, the water that I am drinking is good water, pure water. There is also water in the street, but I won't drink it. It is dirty, filthy. So, you have to know where God is more divine, more sympathetic, more loving.</p>
<p>God is inside cauliflower, tomatoes, everything. So you may say, "Oh, I am eating God!" But if you don't eat cauliflower, potatoes, tomatoes, rice, then you won't be able to live on earth. Here on earth always we are living at the expense of something. But we have to know who is more conscious. Human beings are more conscious than plants. Again, among human beings there are some who are more conscious than others. At the age of eleven you are praying to God. So, you are more conscious than millions and billions of people on earth who are not praying to God. I am showing preference to you and not to your friends and neighbours. Inside them also is God, but inside you God is more conscious right now.</p>
<p>The heart and the soul love God much more than the mind. That is why we say that the heart is better, the soul is better. It is a comparison. The mind is not totally bad; if we don't have the mind, we won't be able to think and we will be like a fool. But there are quite a few things which are better than the mind. Better than the mind is the heart, and better than the heart is the soul. Again, right now the mind is the boss. As long as your mind is the boss, it will make you feel miserable. But when you realise God, you will see that the mind is under your command. When you become the boss of the mind, at that time you are free.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Has God a special Will for our outer life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Has God a special Will for our outer life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In God's Eye, the outer life has to be the expression or revelation of the inner life. So, if the inner life is divine, perfect, then the outer life also eventually has to be divine and perfect. There is only one way that is God's Way: what is within today will be used tomorrow to express and fulfil. So, we must come from inside out. From underneath the ground, the tree germinates and grows upward. Thus, God does have a special Will, but it is in the inner life. In the inner life when we recognise God's Will, it becomes easier to recognise His outer Will. God's Will operates first in the inner life and then in the outer life. But it is the same Will. God gives equal importance to both the inner life and outer life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> By will and by God's Grace. Will itself is God's Grace. What we call will is actually God's Grace. In your family, perhaps your parents are not aspiring, your brothers or other members of your family are not aspiring. So how is it that you are praying and meditating? Just because God's Grace has descended and you have the receptivity to receive God's Grace. Without will, without determination, you can't do anything. But where do will and determination come from? They come from God, from the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Today I was on the George Washington Bridge and a man was threatening to commit suicide. At first I wanted to pray for his life, and then I remembered your saying once that we shouldn&#039;t ask the Supreme to do anything, but only pray for the Supreme&#039;s own Victory.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Today I was on the George Washington Bridge and a man was threatening to commit suicide. At first I wanted to pray for his life, and then I remembered your saying once that we shouldn&#039;t ask the Supreme to do anything, but only pray for the Supreme&#039;s own Victory." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first thing you have to do is ask the Supreme, "Tell me what I should do." In a fleeting second your human mind will say that committing suicide is undoubtedly bad; there is nothing as bad as this. So you will go and save the person and everybody will appreciate you. But how do you know that his suicide has not been sanctioned by the Will of the Supreme? Or perhaps the Supreme has chosen somebody else as an instrument to save this person. The Supreme is not only inside you and the rest of our spiritual family; the Supreme is also inside the policeman. Perhaps you are taking away the policeman's job. Perhaps the policeman is going to save the person and in this way his evolution will take place. Who knows the operation of the Supreme?</p>
<p>It takes only a second to know the Will of the Supreme. If you take a second, He will definitely tell you yes or no. Always you have to take inner permission from the Supreme. Otherwise, who knows whether He has commissioned you to save that person? The thing that you want to do and take the credit for, perhaps the Supreme wants the policeman to do. Now you are taking his credit away.</p>
<p>Since you are a seeker, the first thing will be for you to refer the matter to the Supreme. Then He will tell you what is best for you. Morality may tell you to save the man. But in your case, your oneness with the Supreme's Will is infinitely higher than ordinary morality.</p>
<p>In the <em>Mahabharata,</em> Krishna asked Arjuna to kill all his relatives. In the beginning Arjuna resisted with all his moral weapons. How could he kill his cousins and his nephews and his uncles? But finally he surrendered. He said, "Whatever is Your Will I shall do." Then he became a real instrument, a perfect instrument.</p>

Could you please tell me why this happens?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> 'God' in reverse becomes 'dog.' In your case, when 'God' is replaced by 'dog,' what does it actually mean? Here it means faithfulness. God has all faith in us, in humanity. It is we ungrateful creatures who are wanting in faith in God. He is infinitely better than us in every way, but it is He who has abundant faith in us. A dog, in the spiritual sense — and even here in the field of manifestation — represents infinite faithfulness. A dog is ready to offer its very life to save its master. A dog is ready to offer its very existence at every moment, and what is the dog getting? A piece of bread. In the case of God also, when an aspirant is crying for Light, for self-discovery, for self-realisation, yet all around him ignorance is trying to devour him, it is God who comes and tries to save the person.</p>
<p>Your experience is most significant. When 'God' is uttered and then the word is replaced by 'dog', you have to feel that God wants from you constant and spontaneous faith. You have accepted the spiritual life. For an ordinary person, spirituality means peace of mind for one or two seconds, or spirituality means something that will bring harmony in the family. That is why ordinary people enter into the spiritual life. But a true aspirant enters into the spiritual life with a different motive. For him, spirituality means something that will give him realisation.</p>
<p>Someone can try to get realisation by hook or by crook. In India, many people have tried to realise God within a fixed time — two years, five years or ten years. And if they don't realise God, they commit suicide. But when one wants to realise God, one has to surrender to God's Will. Even the one who is crying for infinite Light must surrender to the Will of God. If one can consciously surrender to the Will of God, that means that one has abundant faith in God's Will in operation.</p>
<p>So, from your experience, I wish to tell you that it is very clear that you have to have faith in your own aspiration. Your spiritual name means divine satisfaction. This satisfaction will come only when you are faithful to the inner cause, and this inner cause is nothing else but God. Every day when you meditate, try to feel that you can satisfy the Supreme only when you have all faith in your life and in God's all-fulfilling cosmic Will for your husband, for your children and for your spiritual brothers and sisters. You must always follow the Light, which is God the aspiration and God the realisation. You are the aspiration today. Tomorrow, on the strength of your faith in your inner divinity, you become God the realisation. So God is faith and dog, the symbol of faith, is God.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Can one know the achievements of God through the intellect alone?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through the intellect alone, one can never, never, never, never, never know the achievements of God. It is impossible! God's true Existence, true Height, true Heart, is millions and billions of miles away from the intellectual domain. Again, we can't say that God doesn't exist in the intellect. No. God is omnipresent. We can't say that God is not here or God is not there. But if one wants to know God's highest Height, His deepest Depth, His all-pervading Consciousness, then one can never know these through the intellect. The intellect is the helper. When we enter into the human creation, intellect does help us. Without intellect, we would all remain brainless sheep. But there comes a time in our evolution when we see the limitations of intellect. On the mental plane there is no peace. Your intellect is fighting against my intellect; two naked swords are fighting against each other. But these swords can never cut asunder the wall of ignorance which is blocking the inner Light, the Light Supreme. For that, we have to go far beyond the intellect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Depend on your sincerity. If you see something, you can acknowledge it for what it is or you can just call it a mental hallucination. I am meditating in my highest. I am offering Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure, infinite measure. You are watching me and immediately you are seeing the reflection of God-Consciousness in me. My consciousness is changed to such an extent that you are bound to see that I am somewhere else. My face will radiate and you will see something inside me if you are meditating well. The other day one of the disciples meditated extremely well and received light from me. Then a visitor, who is not a disciple, asked her, "Is he your father?" She is my spiritual daughter, and she received so much light that a stranger said that we looked alike. Now, what kind of philosophical proof is needed?</p>
<p>Philosophy is in the mind; spirituality is in the heart. If you want philosophy, then you have to see something which you can easily define. If you want to define God with your mind, you will never be able to do it. You have to see God with your heart. If you use your mind, you will feel that I am showing off, rotating my eyes and all that. But if you use your spirituality, easily you will be able to see the proof. In this world the best proof is your own consciousness. If you come to a spiritual Master and meditate for a few minutes, you will see the difference in your consciousness. Let your sincerity be the judge.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does knowledge of our dreams help us to know God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does knowledge of our dreams help us to know God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, if it is a good dream, if it is an inspiring dream, certainly it helps. But if it is an undivine dream, it will not help. If somebody is stabbing you and you are stabbing somebody else, or if you are in the battlefield or some catastrophe is taking place, you have to know that these kinds of dreams come from the vital world and they will not help you at all. But if you have a dream in which an angel appears before you, or if I am blessing you in a dream or if you see a sea of Peace right in front of you, then these kinds of dreams naturally will expedite your spiritual progress. So it depends on what kinds of dreams you have. If it comes from the vital world, the destructive world, then you can't make any progress. But you definitely can make progress when you see divine things or feel in the dream itself Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I fully approve of your cultivating the inner silence. But why do you have to adopt such a difficult method when there is an easier process? The easier process is self-giving. Just give yourself totally and then see whether you are carried away by the waves or whether you become the ocean itself. That is the easiest and most effective way. One way is to dig, dig, dig and God knows when you are going to glimpse a tiny drop of water. The other way is just to throw yourself, let us say, into the sea of Peace, and not worry whether you will meet water animals or jewels inside. The one way takes time and is very uncertain. While you are digging, if you do not get a glimpse of water or consciousness, let us say, then you will be disappointed. You will say, "For six years I have stayed with Sri Chinmoy and I don't know anything. So the best thing is for me to leave him." But the other way, if you go slowly and steadily by giving yourself, throwing yourself into the sea of self-dedication, then you are getting real satisfaction out of life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In one of your books you said, &quot;If you want to see God, you have to meditate twelve hours a day.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible. When you are on the verge of realisation, you will see that it is quite possible, because at that time you have acquired considerable capacity. Even while you are eating, you will see that you are meditating. While you are talking, while you are doing your office job, you will see that you are having your best meditation. At that time, you will be able to do four things at a time. After you make considerable progress in your inner life, you will see that your mouth is functioning and, at the same time, your heart, your inner being, is doing something else. So twenty-four hours a day your inner being will be able to meditate. It is quite possible.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are seeing God and feeling God the same thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are seeing God and feeling God the same thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. You see a flower and you think, "Oh, it is so beautiful." But you may not feel the beauty in yourself. You can see the beauty of an object, but you may not feel the quality of that object as part of yourself. Again, in feeling there is seeing. Inside feeling, there is a kind of inner seeing. Again, the beauty of a flower you can see. But to get its real fragrance — that is different matter. The fragrance has to enter into you and become part and parcel of you. Then you feel the very essence of the flower.</p>
<p>With your eyes, you see five or six petals. This is your immediate perception. But feeling also will give you some of the inner fragrance that the flower embodies. And if you can use the third eye, then you not only see what you have to see and feel what you have to feel, but also you become. At that time, you look at the flower and see the flower as such. You feel the fragrance of the flower. And you become the life-breath of the flower; you become the flower itself.</p>
<p>When a spiritual Master looks at a disciple, what happens? First he sees the face, the physical body. Then he feels the good and bad qualities — all mixed up — that the person embodies. And third, he claims all the good qualities and bad qualities of the disciple as his own, as his own responsibility. He immediately claims that person as his very own. So, when you use the third eye, at that time seeing, feeling and becoming are one. In the spiritual life, seeing, feeling and becoming go together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, you have spoken of realisation as a tree. What determines how high a soul climbs on that tree?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, you have spoken of realisation as a tree. What determines how high a soul climbs on that tree?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Realisation is a very, very tall tree; it is always transcending its own height. The capacity of the soul and the patience of the soul determine how high the soul climbs. It depends on how much light the soul embodies. The soul may become tired after climbing for some distance and then it can take rest. There are many souls who have achieved partial realisation and now they don't want to come back into the world. They are afraid of the world. They feel the ignorance of the world will again try to devour them, so they don't come. They have reached a certain height and they don't want to go further. They have got limited or even vast Peace, Light and Bliss. But they don't want to come down again and work for earth, so they will never reach the Highest.</p>
<p>Either you have to reach the Highest and then come down, or you go up a little, come down and do something for the world, and then go up again. First you get for yourself and then you distribute; or while distributing, you empty yourself and then create more receptivity in yourself. If you are giving what you have — some inspiration, some aspiration — then naturally God will give you more. So, realisation is such that if you realise something and then offer it, while offering it, you are going up. Again, the higher you go, the more you can give. The realisation-tree is like that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Becoming intimate with God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Becoming intimate with God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: When I want to think of the Supreme as my friend, what is the most effective way of doing it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are resting, sometimes you inwardly talk to yourself or you talk to a friend. Your friend may be hundreds of miles away from you. Physically you can't see him, but you can feel him. His vibration you can feel. No matter where he is, immediately you can feel his vibration. In the same way, try to imagine that there is a constant Friend, an eternal Friend inside you, and that is the Supreme.</p>
<p>When you are speaking to your friend mentally, he may not be there. God knows where he is, but still you are talking to him. He is not listening to you, but you are going on, going on. But when you talk to the Supreme, you have to know that definitely He <em>is</em> listening to you. When you can make yourself feel that there is Somebody to listen to you, when you can feel His Presence, then automatically your way of talking to the Supreme is complete.</p>
<p>You have come to the church and knocked at the door and you are sure that I am here inside the church. So you are talking to me, even though you don't see me with your physical eyes. Similarly, when you knock at your heart's door, feel that the Supreme is there inside your heart. If you feel that He is there, if you can feel His Presence, then that is enough. Then your conversation will be perfect.</p>
