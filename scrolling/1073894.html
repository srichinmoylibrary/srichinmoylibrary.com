  <h2 id="page-title">The story of Ganapati</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The story of Ganapati" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>These are all true stories about a little Bengali village boy named Ganapati. Ganapati came of a large family. He had many aunts, uncles and cousins. One of these cousins, whose name was Suren, was the cause of a most serious tragedy in the family. If ever Ganapati were to write a novel about his cousin’s life, perhaps he would get the Nobel Prize! It is exactly like one of Shakespeare’s plays in which tragedy becomes such wonderful comedy!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The grandmother’s prediction</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The grandmother’s prediction" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before Ganapati was born, his grandmother predicted that he would destroy the whole family and turn it topsy-turvy because he was born in a particular month. They say that whoever takes birth in that month will be the cause of the family’s destruction. That was Ganapati’s grandmother’s prediction. But Ganapati’s mother immediately protested. She said that her son would bring the family lots of name and fame, and they would have the joy and pride of having among them the golden kettledrum that is played in Heaven.</p>
<p>Another grandmother prophesied that Ganapati would be a clerk. For a village woman to have a grandson who is a clerk is a real achievement. What she actually meant was that Ganapati was destined to deal with paper. She was right! In his later life, Ganapati went on to write many, many books. Instead of becoming a clerk, Ganapati became a poet and author. This is how her prophecy came true.</p>
<p>Ganapati used to admire Akbar, the greatest of the Mughal emperors. Of all the Mughal emperors, Akbar the Great was the one who wanted most sincerely to unite Hindus, Muslims and Christians into one religion. He tried extremely, extremely hard to bring about his lofty goal. For him, there was only one religion, which was love of God. Ganapati was happy that, according to historians, the emperor Akbar was an expert in playing the madal — kettledrum. Akbar had many singers and musicians of the highest order in his court. He also had many, many musical instruments at his disposal, but he liked the kettledrum the most.</p>

<p>Ganapati’s father was extremely well-respected in the village where he lived. When he retired from his job as chief inspector of the Assam-Bengal railway line, he opened up a bank in Chittagong. The bank was inside a very grand and beautiful building. The name of this bank was “Griha Lakshmi,” which means “House of Lakshmi.”</p>
<p>Ganapati’s father worked at the bank, along with Ganapati’s maternal uncle and Ganapati’s brother Ananta. The bank had four or five small extra rooms where they used to sleep overnight during the week. Ganapati’s cousin, Suren, who was about fifteen or twenty years older than Ganapati, would also sleep at the bank. Then, on the weekend, they would return to their family in the village by boat.</p>

<p>Suren’s parents had both passed away when he was quite young. So Ganapati’s parents had assumed responsibility for bringing up Suren. He came to live at Ganapati’s house and Ganapati’s father treated him like his own son.</p>
<p>Suren was so affectionate to Ganapati’s whole family. Any time that he needed or wanted money, Ganapati’s parents gave it to him happily, lovingly and unconditionally.</p>

<p>When he was still quite young, Suren became a revolutionary. Eventually he was arrested for his involvement in India’s independence movement and went to jail for his anti-British activities.</p>
<p>In the jail the prisoners kept a very small, cute animal as a pet. It was forbidden to take anything out of the jail, whether it was a bird, a squirrel or any other animal. But on the day that he was due to be released, Suren thought of Ganapati and wanted to bring him a gift. So he decided to smuggle this little animal from the jail as a gift for his youngest cousin.</p>
<p>Normally, Suren never wore a hat or cap. But on the day he was coming out of jail, he put on a very dignified suit and a tie and wore a hat. Under the hat he was hiding the little animal. Because he was wearing such gorgeous clothing, nobody suspected him and he was able to fool the guards.</p>
<p>When Suren gave his little cousin the cute animal, Ganapati was thrilled. Ganapati was four or five years old at that time, and he liked his present very, very much.</p>
<p>This was the kind of close bond that Suren had with Ganapati’s family!</p>

<p>Ganapati’s mother and one of Ganapati’s aunts wanted Suren to get married. Taking advice from Ganapati’s father, together they chose a bride according to the Indian custom.</p>
<p>The aunt gave lots of money for the marriage ceremony. Ganapati’s parents also gave very generously. None of their sons or daughters planned to get married, so they were very happy that at least one member of their big family would be leading a family life.</p>
<p>Everybody liked Suren and they all were so delighted that he was getting married.</p>

<p>Ganapati’s parents had bought lots of jewellery for the marriages of their three daughters, but these young girls did not want to get married. This jewellery, along with the jewellery of Ganapati’s mother, aunts and cousins, plus their family savings, was all kept in a safe at “Griha Lakshmi.”</p>
<p>One day all of Ganapati’s relatives returned to the village to observe the Durga Puja festival. Ganapati’s father entrusted Suren with the job of guarding the bank. But what Suren did was steal all the money and jewellery from this safe, and then disappear.</p>
<p>That was how he guarded the bank!</p>

<p>Suren did not have the key to the safe, so the night of the robbery he brought over the locksmith. The locksmith knew Ganapati’s family and liked them so much. He knew that Suren used to live at the bank during the week with Ganapati’s father and he trusted Suren.</p>
<p>Suren told the locksmith that Ganapati’s father wanted him to return immediately to the village with some of the jewellery so he could give it to someone. But, unfortunately, Suren said, he had misplaced the key to the safe.</p>
<p>So the locksmith opened the safe and went away. He was completely innocent. When he found out afterwards what had happened, he struck his head and chest with his hands over and over again!</p>

<p>Suren was so clever. When he robbed the family bank, he took only the family money and jewellery. He knew that Ganapati’s father would not sue him since it was a family matter.</p>
<p>Many people advised Ganapati’s father to sue him, but Ganapati’s father said, “He is like a son to me. If one of my children had done this, would I sue?”</p>
<p>His father insisted on paying back his relatives for the jewellery that had been stolen. Fortunately, Suren had not bothered stealing anything from others. Otherwise, Ganapati’s father would have faced a most serious financial crisis.</p>

<p>Ganapati’s maternal uncle was his father’s dearest friend and greatest admirer. When this uncle learned that Suren had stolen the family’s money and jewels, he thought that Ganapati’s whole family would be ruined.</p>
<p>He said to Ganapati’s father, “What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>Ganapati’s father tried to reassure him. He said, “Do not worry. We will not suffer at all. I have so much property and also I have money in other banks.”</p>
<p>But Ganapati’s uncle was not convinced. He had such love for Ganapati’s family that eventually he became insane with worry and anxiety.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, this uncle committed suicide by jumping into the path of a moving train. The train severed his head from his body. The train authorities placed the body inside the railway station in a glass cabinet, with the head on top, as if the uncle were still alive. Ganapati’s older brothers and sisters were horrified and shocked when they saw this. They did not allow Ganapati’s mother to see her brother because they knew she would have fainted.</p>
<p>Later Ganapati’s father went to the crematory hall. When everything was over and he came back home, his eyes were flooded with tears.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, just two days before he committed suicide, this uncle spent the evening with Ganapati’s family in their village. There he saw Ganapati playing with a tennis ball. Immediately he came up and started scolding Ganapati. Normally this uncle was always so affectionate to the little boy, but this time he was acting very strangely. He said, “It is evening. You have to be very careful. You must go home and study. If you do not study, you will be illiterate.”</p>
<p>At that time Ganapati was about nine and a half years old. He could not believe that his uncle was scolding him, since he was usually so affectionate. When Ganapati went home, he told his mother what had happened. But she said that his uncle was right — evening was the time for him to study.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What love can do</h2><span property="dc:title" content="What love can do" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are many stories about the love that this maternal uncle had for Ganapati’s whole family.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s eldest brother, Samrat, was extremely close to this uncle’s eldest son, who was named Kulai. Both Samrat and Kulai were many years older than Ganapati.</p>
<p>It happened that Kulai became sick and had to go into the hospital. After two or three weeks, his case became very serious. Then, early one morning he died.</p>
<p>On that particular day, Samrat was supposed to take his final examination at college. Ganapati’s uncle knew that if Samrat came to learn that his dearest friend had died, he would feel sad and miserable and not do well in his examination. So he cleverly, wisely and compassionately kept his son’s death a secret.</p>
<p>On the morning that Kulai died, the cook in Ganapati’s house did not appear. So this uncle started cooking for Samrat. While cooking, he was smiling so happily.</p>
<p>He told Samrat, “When you come back from the examination, I will have a most delicious meal for you. I will also cook a second meal for your dearest friend, Kulai, and you can bring it to him.”</p>
<p>Then he pretended that Kulai was making a surprising recovery. Samrat was so delighted to hear that his friend had taken a turn for the better, and he was looking forward to visiting him that evening. So he was doubly happy when he took his examination. He always stood first, but on that day everything came easily to him. Because of his unimaginable happiness, he finished his examination in a very short time!</p>
<p>That evening, after eating the meal that his uncle had cooked, he brought the second meal over to the hospital for Kulai. There he heard the sad news that his dear friend had passed away earlier that morning.</p>
<p>In the Indian system, the body has to be burned on the day of death. So already the body had been taken to his maternal uncle’s house. Samrat cried and cried as he went to his maternal uncle’s house to see his dearest friend for the last time.</p>
<p>Ganapati’s maternal uncle had fooled Samrat only because of his tremendous love and affection for him. Otherwise, how could a father do this kind of thing?</p>

<p>Any time this uncle visited Ganapati’s family, he always brought Ganapati five or six toys. And whenever Ganapati went to his uncle’s house, his uncle would treat him like his own son. He made sure that he had exactly the same toys to play with as his own youngest daughter, Dipali.</p>
<p>One day, while Ganapati and Dipali were playing together, Ganapati boasted, “When I become great, I will give you a most beautiful necklace.” At the time, Ganapati was eight and Dipali was six.</p>
<p>“Will you keep your promise?” begged little Dipali.</p>
<p>“Definitely I will,” said Ganapati.</p>
<p>When Ganapati and Dipali grew up, they rarely saw one another. Ganapati and his family moved to a spiritual community in a faraway town and Dipali got married and had five or six children of her own. Her husband was quite wealthy.</p>
<p>Many years later, when Ganapati was an adult, he went to America to open a spiritual centre of his own. One day, out of the blue, he received a letter from Dipali. She wrote, “When we were young, you promised to buy me a necklace. Will you keep your promise?”</p>
<p>Then Ganapati remembered the promise he had made when he was just a little kid. He immediately sent money to his sister, and his sister sent the money to Dipali so she could buy a very nice necklace and fulfil her heart’s desire.</p>
<p>In this way, Ganapati kept his promise.</p>
