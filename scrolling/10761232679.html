<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Universal Consciousness gets them. But the only thing is, disciples have an endless reservoir. This morning we empty the dustbin and then in five minutes again it is the same mess. Every day it is being emptied by my loving concern, and every day it is being filled by the same undivine forces — the same, same, same. If I can empty the dark forces from your life and they do not return, then you are on the verge of transformation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, from there they won’t take any kind of human shape or anything, and they are not going to be transformed. Only there they remain. The Universal Consciousness is very vast, infinite; so easily they can remain there. Again, one day, the things in this Universal Consciousness also have to be transformed. Because we care for the perfection of the entire universe, they have to be transformed. But right now we are concentrating on the transformation only of the people who are aspiring consciously.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can come, but not from there. If somebody consciously cherishes wrong movements, emotional thoughts, vital thoughts and all that, then they can come back again. I can throw these forces, but if you are eager to get them back, they will return. Also, you can create them. You people are constantly creating them. Many people consciously cry for poison. Poison means emotional life, lower vital life. So then they come back.</p>
<p>What can I do? Only I can take it from the disciples and put it in the other place. If the mother sees the child playing with a knife, she takes the knife and puts it into some other room beyond his reach. But if the child starts crying for the knife, he will be able to get it back again. If he feels he needs the knife for his own purposes, he looks around for it. Then he enters into the room and brings it back. But if the knife remains with the child, at some time or other the child may stab himself. Like this, these forces come back quite often. Only if the Master is very happy and pleased with the disciple and the disciple is indomitable in his will, will the Master not allow these forces to come back. Then both Master and disciple are successful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you do it? Through more sincere aspiration. Every time you say to yourself, “Don’t do this!” just don’t do it. And when you say, “Do this!” then do it, no matter how hard it is. Suppose an individual is weak in the vital world; let us say that individual is emotionally weak. So he has to pay more attention on the vital plane than on any other plane. If someone is very insecure, that person should say, “No, why should I have that feeling of insecurity? Let me have the feeling of security.” And how can he or she maintain the feeling of security? Through loving oneness. So always try to stand on the other side, the positive side.</p>
<p>If you have any weakness, try to stand on the other side. If you have jealousy, then try to feel friendship and oneness. In that way only you can do it. See the other side, which is the positive side. Then you can do it.</p>
<p>Our difficulty is that we think more of others than of ourselves — not of their dedication but of their achievements. We always think that they have achieved something grand. No matter what we have achieved, even if it is infinitely superior to others’ achievements, we see our own achievement as useless, useless. Others’ achievements are far better, we feel. So all the time we are seeing and thinking of others — others’ achievements, others’ capacities. But your capacity as an individual is what I will be pleased with when I am dealing with you. I will not be pleased with borrowed capacity, and I will not be pleased if you think of others’ capacity. I will be satisfied only with your capacity as an individual.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, the only thing is that the forces have to see your total disgust for them. They have to feel that you sincerely mean it. They have to see that you really don’t want them, that they have played their role. But so long as they have a little hope that you will invite them in, they will keep coming back. Unconsciously you get a kind of pleasure, an unconscious pleasure, when they come, and that unconscious pleasure the forces notice. Then they go on attacking, attacking. But when you are moving them out of your system, they have to feel that you really don’t want them anymore. And if they aren’t there, that is the proof that you people have succeeded. People <em>have</em> realised God. People have realised the Light just by removing these bad forces.</p>

<h2>Attacking the Master</h2>

<p><em>After answering the questions in the previous chapter, Sri Chinmoy delivered the following remarks. He was at a disciples home, with about fifty other disciples. The incident discussed took place in December 1972.</em></p>
<p>I am a nice man. I have to brag. I have to brag. During this one-hour question period, I have been showing my utmost love — father’s love, friend’s love, everything. But eleven disciples right now are consciously dissatisfied with me. And, believe me, they have been attacking me like anything. I can say point-blank who she is, who he is. This attack — where am I keeping it now? In this portion of my head. Is it not my infinite compassion? Right now if I say the names of the persons who have attacked me, then to the end of your lives the rest of you will curse those people. With such affection and love I have been speaking with you about first class, second class, third class disciples. But some of you are feeling that you are not even fourth or fifth class; that’s why terrible anger has entered into you and now you are attacking.</p>
<p>How many of you here are first class and how many are second class or third class, I know. Now, if you are first class or second class, is it fair to attack me? I tell you, eleven persons have attacked me. Here in my physical I feel your attack. See, my inner beings are now removing it and throwing it into the Universal Consciousness. Now they are taking it away. You people are blind. God has given you only outer eyes. With your eyes you may see that Guru is doing nothing. But my inner beings have started; they are taking it away from me. You do not know the kind of pain I am going through now. All of your anger I have taken right here (points to the back of his neck). If I say the truth, I become your enemy. Again, there are a few who are fifth class or sixth class disciples here who have not cursed me.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am meditating with you people it happens also. Oh, every body has folded hands; everybody is doing like this (folds his hands). You all look like you are giving your devotion. But no, instead of giving your love and devotion, you are only giving your jealousy and all your vital demands. You are throwing them. If you throw them into me with devotedness, they do not attack me. But when you throw them with arrogance, pride, vanity or an aggressive quality, then they attack me like anything. You can give me all your lowest vital problems; all your sex forces you can give me. I don’t mind, but with devotedness you have to give me. Then I can help you. But when you give them to me with aggression, they come and attack me like anything.</p>
<p>I tell you, I am the dustbin. Yes, you give me all your absolutely lowest, filthiest forces. Yes, you give me. But if you give me with devotedness, they do not attack me. Otherwise, they attack me. It is not my compassion? Right now my inner beings have taken those forces away. Now I am feeling absolutely no pain. But this thing — every day it happens in all the Centres. Sometimes I get so mad at some of the disciples, and many, many plans come to my mind: what to say to them, what to do. But I am at the mercy of my compassion, and I remain silent.</p>
<p>Today I am telling you, if in the future I say something which displeases you people, please feel that there is nothing to be displeased about. Even if you feel that you are a seventh class disciple, just be grateful for that. You can say, “True, I am a seventh class disciple, but at least I still exist as a disciple. So I can progress. Today I am absolutely at the foot of the tree, but tomorrow I can climb up to the topmost branch. Just because I am at the foot of the tree, I at least have the opportunity to climb. There are millions who are not even near the tree; they are thousands of miles away from the tree. So for them it is simply impossible right now.</p>
<p>So please, please! You people attack me like anything. In the morning you attack, in the afternoon you attack, anytime you get angry you attack. From now on, when you get angry, try to give me all your anger with devotedness. It is an offering. A flower you offer with devotion; love you offer with devotion. So, when you are angry, at that time your possession is anger. Your wealth at that time, your undivine wealth, is your anger. So that wealth also you offer with devotedness. Then it will not attack me. And the moment you give it to me, you will get joy, because you have given me something which is your possession. But when you give it to me the other way, when you give your anger, depression or wrong things in an arrogant or violent way, then only you try to destroy me. They cannot destroy me; only they create pangs inside my heart, because I am trying to help you and you are trying to hurt me. So please, please do not attack me. I am a nice man.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Disciple performances</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Disciple performances" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Later that evening, Sri Chinmoy asked one of his disciples to perform something to entertain the others. When the disciple said he had nothing to perform, the Master made the following remarks:</em></p>
<p>Sometimes I ask you people to perform, but you don’t want to. You have a box with a treasure inside; only you are not parting with it. Some people keep their box under lock and key because there is nothing inside. People think that just because it is kept under lock and key there is most precious wealth inside. But no, as soon as they open it up they see that it is empty. But when I am pleading with you — please, please give us a little bit of your wealth — it is because you do have something. At that time you can really share it. So if you have wealth, and we are begging you to share it, you should share it. Otherwise, we have every right to feel that the box is all empty. You have to prove that, no, there is something inside the box. So take up the challenge.</p>
