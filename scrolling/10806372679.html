<p>It was really a worthwhile afternoon. I really enjoyed it. It's too bad that he didn't do it earlier, about two years ago. It answered a lot of questions the mothers had; it put my mind at ease. All the mothers appreciated the time and thoughtfulness that was put into the day. It took a lot of work. One thing was that everyone participated in the activities and everyone was so kind and warm. This was a very warm and close experience.</p>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for a pleasant afternoon. Your hospitality was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><em>(From comments to her daughter)</em></p>
<p>I felt a very, very warm feeling from everybody getting together. Everyone was very generous and hospitable and I felt at home. The restaurant was tremendously clean; everything was spotless. I felt the question and answer time was very good and all the questions that were asked were good for me. I also found the Primer informative as to the nature of Guru's path.</p>

<p>I was honoured on March 9th to be a guest of Sri Chinmoy and his disciples at a luncheon at the Annam Brahma restaurant. We came as strangers, but found a common meeting ground — the mothers through love for their children, the children through love for their Guru and the Guru through his love for God. The result was sincerity, which to me is excellence. My heart was thankful to Sri Chinmoy for the thoughtfulness he has inspired in the young people who worked so hard and generously to show us their love. The feeling of graciousness was only outshone by the feeling of love that went into the preparations to make us welcome. The food was delicious, our presents were beautiful, and Guru's words to us and his answers to our questions were as reassuring as the bright and happy faces around us. The paths that we travel are different, but I am glad we can reach out,and have the understanding to appreciate each other.</p>

<p>Dear Guru,</p>
<p>It was a very nice and interesting afternoon. A million thanks for everything.</p>
<p><em>(From comments to her daughter)</em></p>
<p>[...] I hope for the best. This is a revolutionary period indeed because of the new concepts altering the accepted church dogmas and practices. The upheaval will reshape our past religious thoughts, making them seem childlike. Maybe we are now on the threshold of deeper knowledge and conviction of a truly Universal Intelligence far more advanced than we have ever had before [...] And this period is one of pain, for it brings the birth pangs of a new religious reverence which can only come through soul-stirring challenges.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for a wonderful afternoon. I couldn't believe all the effort you all put into it. It must have taken so much work. Those waiters were marvellous. And so were the girls making the food in the restaurant. The food was marvellous. The entire preparation was marvellous and the kids were so nice to us. I couldn't get over it. All of us felt this way.</p>
<p>The mothers were simply great. I loved them. We were extremely compatible. You completely understand each other; we completely understand each other. We start with one thing in common: bewilderment. But we soon saw that this is not a kookie organisation; none of the children is a kook. I have never met anyone in your organisation whom I didn't like. The parents feel that whatever this may be, it is something our children had to do.</p>
<p>I was flabbergasted because I didn't think the Guru, Sri Chinmoy, would dare to answer questions from us. He was facing an audience, most of whom didn't want to believe. Of course, he answered everything in his own way, but how could he answer things in our way? It is a matter of faith. Ask someone why he is a devout Catholic. Whatever he says it comes down to, "Because I believe." There is no way to dispute this kind of thing intellectually or emotionally.</p>
<p>The fact is that you were trying. Just that you had us there amazed us. You were saying that you weren't throwing us out of your lives. He made that quite clear. It was most successful and please do it again.</p>
