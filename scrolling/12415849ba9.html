  <h2 id="page-title">Kanu’s conversation in Bengali</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Kanu’s conversation in Bengali" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last night Kanu’s soul came to me, and we were talking in Bengali. In Bengali he told me, “Your name is Sri Chinmoy, hut your nickname is Madal.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Now keep it a secret. Do not tell anybody that I can speak Bengali!” His soul was full of adoration and affection.</p>

<p>SONA’S CLOSE CALL</p>
<p>About seven or eight years ago, Sona went for treatment at Mridul’s Animal Hospital in New Paltz. It was just a simple matter; Sona was not sick at all. All of a sudden, Mridul phoned me up. He said, “Guru, I can’t believe it! I can’t believe it!”</p>
<p>I asked, “What happened?”</p>
<p>He said, “I can’t believe it, I can’t believe it! In my hands, in my hands, Sona has gone!”</p>
<p>I said, “Mridul, wait for a minute.” Then I put all my concentration on Sona. After a few minutes, I heard Mridul say, “Oh, he has come back, he has come back!”</p>
<p>That was the happiest news!</p>

<p>The day I first met with President Gorbachev — 29 May 1990 — Kanu was dying. I was in Ottawa, Canada. My meeting with the President was supposed to take place at the Governor General’s residence. But the whole day I was only thinking of Kanu, instead of thinking about the world’s greatest man. How many times from Canada I called Mridul!</p>
<p>And after my meeting with President Gorbachev was over, I rushed to the telephone to find out about Kanu.</p>

<p>Many times I used to feel so sad for the disciples who work in my house because Sona was uncontrollable. They would try desperately to grab him, but they could not. Sona would run away. He used to make their life miserable.</p>

<p>The day Sona left, around three-thirty in the morning, I stood behind him and touched him and blessed him. I said, “Now, Sona, you can go.”</p>
<p>His soul said to me, “No, I do not want to go, I do not want to go.”</p>
<p>I said, “You are suffering, suffering, suffering. I have kept you on earth. You have been so kind and compassionate to me.”</p>
<p>He said, “Then, all right. I will go with your blessings.”</p>
<p>I told him, “My blessings, love, gratitude and gratitude, and pride and pride will stay with you.”</p>
<p>Then, after leaving the body, again he was sad. He wanted to be on earth. I said, “Now you have left the body. If I wanted you on earth, I would not have allowed you to die. I wanted you to go, and you have left. With my blessings, joy and pride you have left.”</p>

<p>For two hours after he left the body, Sona felt sad. In the meantime, Kanu came to meet him in the soul’s world. Kanu was so thrilled and so happy; he was literally jumping with joy. Then my mother’s soul came. I said to her, “You have taken Kanu to be with you.” My mother said, “I will take Sona also.”</p>
<p>Kanu wanted to play with Sona, but Sona was still sad. On earth, Kanu was so small and Sona was much larger by comparison, although both the dogs were quite small. Now, in the soul’s world, Kanu is so big and Sona is so small. Kanu is full of compassion, and Sona is the little child. Here Sona was the big brother; now Kanu is the big brother.</p>
<p>Kanu is so happy to have Sona with him again.</p>

<p>When you look at Sona’s picture, he is so alive. He is full of compassion. The last few days I saw only compassion in his big, big eyes. After his passing also, when he was lying in the meditation room, I looked at him. I was seeing that his eyes were full of affection and compassion. Such compassion he developed at that time.</p>

<p>For the last four or five days, both Sona’s and Kanu’s souls have been playing upstairs in my room. I enter into the room, and then I see that they are playing and jumping on my bed. So vividly I see that their souls are playing — not fighting, but playing and playing and playing.</p>

<p>One day recently I was very, very sad. Sona’s soul appeared before me and told me that he would make me happy by bringing me happy news. He was on earth for fifteen years, so he would bring me fifteen pieces of good news.</p>
<p>I asked, “When? In how many years?”</p>
<p>He said, “No, by the end of this year.”</p>
<p>He has already brought two or three pieces of good news. When I have heard fifteen, by the end of this year, in Japan, I will declare the good news that Sona has brought me.</p>

<p>These two dogs, Sona and Kanu, will not have any more animal incarnations. No more animal incarnations for them — only human incarnations.

<p>In the early 1980s, Sri Chinmoy embarked on a new adventure, welcoming into his house a variety of birds, dogs, monkeys, chinchillas and other pets. Sri Chinmoy explained that while offering his love, affection and concern to the animal kingdom, these qualities would also touch the human level, entering into his spiritual children and flowing into the Universal Consciousness. This volume contains charming and sometimes amusing stories about Sri Chinmoy’s experiences with his pets, as well as with the disciples who assisted in caring for them.</p>
