  <h2 id="page-title">Smile, love and claim</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Smile, love and claim" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Smile, my friends, my soulful friends, smile. Let us smile. True, this world of ours is full of suffering and excruciating pangs, but that is no reason why we should not smile. We must smile in order to unburden the world's suffering-burden. We must smile in order to diminish its untold pangs.</p>
<p>Love, my friends, my soulful friends, love. Let us love. True, this world of ours is full of hatred and disbelief, but that is no reason why we should not love and why we should not believe. We must love and believe in order to empty the hatred-sea. We must love and believe in order to break asunder the cliffs and peaks of disbelief-mountain.</p>
<p>Claim, my friends, my soulful friends, claim. Let us claim. True, this world of ours has deceived us and betrayed us. Nevertheless, we must claim the world, for it is our bounden duty to change the face of the world. Unless and until we claim the world, we can never transform this world; therefore, we must claim this world as our own, very own, with a view to transforming it.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not forget to smile at our Beloved Supreme, to love our Beloved Supreme and to claim our Beloved Supreme, for He is our Eternity's own, and we are His Eternity's own.</p>
<p>We shall smile at our Beloved Supreme precisely because He is divinely great. We shall love our Beloved Supreme precisely because He is supremely good. We shall claim our Beloved Supreme precisely because we are His Eternity's chosen instruments. Him to please in His own way, Him to fulfil in His own way — it is for this we all saw the light of day. He is our Source. In Him we see, in Him we feel, in Him we fulfil our journey's course.</p>
<p>Smile, love and claim. This world of ours is undoubtedly a projection of our Beloved Supreme, although it is far from perfection. But there will come a time when we shall be able to radically transform the face of this world and turn it into Perfection-Reality.</p>
<p>Let us smile at God, love Him and claim Him, for He is all-where only for us, unconditionally for us.</p>

<p>Imagination, O imagination! How do I use my imagination?</p>
<p>I use my imagination to forget my past failures.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to brave my present challenges.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to welcome my future dawn.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to touch and feel my Lord's Compassion-Feet.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to drink deep my Lord's Nectar-Heart.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to see my Lord's Vision-Eye.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to touch my Lord's Assurance-Arms.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to become an exact prototype of my Lord's Heaven-Beauty.</p>
<p>I use my imagination to become a co-sharer of my Lord's earth-responsibility.</p>
<p>What is my imagination? My imagination is the harbinger of my aspiration-tree.</p>
<p>What is my aspiration? My aspiration is the builder of my realisation-palace.</p>
<p>What is my realisation? My realisation is my Lord's and my oneness-song.</p>

<p>Simplicity is my lifelong friend. My simplicity-friend has cut down my desire-tree.</p>
<p>Sincerity is my lifelong friend. My sincerity-friend has snapped my guilt-conscience-chain.</p>
<p>Purity is my lifelong friend. My purity-friend has secretly told me that love is the only force, the illumining force, the fulfilling force, the supreme force.</p>
<p>Divinity is my lifelong friend. My friend divinity teaches me how to live always inside the Source and how to live only for the Source, the perennial Source.</p>
<p>Immortality is my lifelong friend. My friend Immortality tells me that here on earth my heart's inner cry is the only thing immortal, and there in Heaven my soul's smile is the only thing immortal.</p>
<p>My Beloved Supreme is my lifelong Friend. My Friend, my Beloved Supreme, tells me that here on earth His Grace is my only salvation, and there in Heaven His Face is my only satisfaction.</p>
<p>O my simplicity, sincerity, purity, divinity, Immortality and Beloved Supreme friends, to each of you I offer my own Eternity's gratitude-heart, my own Infinity's oneness-source, my own Immortality's perfection-delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How do I use my aspiration?</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to unite my earth's ascending cry and my Heaven's descending smile.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to transform my world's desire-night into my world's illumination-height. I use my aspiration to feed my hungry Beloved Supreme; Him I feed with my aspiration's gratitude-flames.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to unlearn everything that my earth-bound mind has taught me, and right from the beginning to learn everything from my Heaven-free soul.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration to be the most intimate friend of my sweet, kind and beautiful oneness-heart.</p>
<p>I use my aspiration for success in the outer world and for progress in the inner world. When I succeed, the outer world smiles at me, appreciates me, adores me and extols me to the skies. When I progress soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, my Beloved Supreme smiles at me, blesses me and embraces me.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is my self-giving.</p>
<p>What is self-giving? Self-giving is a supreme art. From this art I come to realise that I have to fathom my unknown realities and I have to know my higher self which abides deep in the inmost recesses of my heart. I have to become consciously and inseparably one with my higher self, which is in perfect tune with my Beloved Supreme constantly, and I have to manifest my yet-unmanifested realities.</p>
<p>My aspiration embodies concentration, meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>Concentration is my speed. With this speed I run fast, faster and fastest towards my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Meditation is my depth, my silence-depth. With this silence-depth I invoke my sweet Lord Supreme and place Him deep inside my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>Contemplation is my ecstasy. With this ecstasy I sing my oneness-song with my Eternity's Father Supreme. With my contemplation-ecstasy I dance my satisfaction-dance with my Lord, who is my Eternity's Friend and Companion. With my Lord the Father I sing. With my Lord the Friend I dance.</p>

<p>What is realisation? Realisation is my sweet remembrance of my forgotten past.</p>
<p>What is realisation? Realisation is my recovery from my ignorance-disease which has troubled me for millennia.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A fleeting life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A fleeting life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A fleeting life is all we have. So why do we boast, why do we disproportionately exaggerate our earthly, mortal and brittle achievements? The physical in us, no matter how strong, fails us when the Prince of Gloom appears. When death appears, the physical deserts us no matter how strong it is, the vital deserts us no matter how enthusiastic it is, the mind deserts us no matter how brilliant it is, the heart deserts us no matter how kind and pure it is.</p>
<p>A fleeting life is all we have. Why then do we listen to the dictates of the physical world, the temptation- world? Why? Why? Why do we not listen to the dictates of the all-illumining and all-fulfilling soul? Why? Why? Why do we dine each night, all night long, with ignorance-sea? Why do we sport with darkness-dragon every day, all day long? Why? Why? Why do we not love God even conditionally, if it is impossible for us to love God unconditionally? Why? Why?</p>
<p>A fleeting life is all we have. Why do we not please God partially, if it is not within our capacity to please God totally and unreservedly? Why? Why? Can we not say to God once and for all that, although we have given all of our previous lives, even to the previous second, to ignorance-night, from now on we shall give this fleeting life of ours to Him alone? Can we not give God the full authority to guide us, mould us and shape us in His own way? Since we have failed in the hands of ignorance, can we not give God a chance to direct our life? If God too fails, then we shall see what we ourselves can do with our life. But is it not fair on our part at least to give God a chance, as countless times we have given chances to ignorance-night? Let this short incarnation of ours be offered to God and God alone. If we offer our life to God, then ours will be the life short in years but long in achievements.</p>
<p>God says to us, "Children, I have promised you that I shall not misuse you, I shall not misguide you. I shall prove to you that I can make new personalities, new realities and new divinities out of you; only give Me a chance. As you have time and again given chances to ignorance, even so for this short, fleeting time give Me the chance and see what I can do for you, since you cannot see what I have already done for you.</p>
<p>"Children, give Me a chance and see what I can do in this fleeting life of yours. This fleeting life can be expanded and extended, My children, if you care to envision My Divinity with your surrendered heart and with your oneness-soul. A fleeting life need not and cannot be the last word of the earth-arena. An endless life, a birthless and deathless life, can alone satisfy man, the future God."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I wish to be free</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I wish to be free" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I wish to be free from restlessness, fear and doubt. Restlessness slows down my speed, my inner speed. Fear unnerves me. Doubt poisons me. I need quietude to replace my restlessness. I need courage to replace my fear. I need faith to replace my doubt. My quietude is my confidence, my Lord's assurance. My courage shall serve God the man throughout the length and breadth of the world. My courage shall love man the God in the inner world and in the outer world. My faith shall expedite not only my journey, but the journey of all sincere seekers; for we are one, inseparably one. The strength of my faith will strengthen them and the strength of their faith will strengthen me.</p>
<p>I wish to be free from insincerity, insecurity and impurity. Insincerity separates me from my Lord's greatness. Insecurity separates me from my Lord's vastness. Impurity separates me from my Lord's closeness. Sincerity will replace my insincerity. Security will replace my insecurity. Purity will replace my impurity. My sincerity from now on will be my safeguard; it will always save me from inner and outer destruction. My security will make me feel that my Source, my Beloved Supreme, is always for me, for me, for me, for me. No matter what I do or what I say, He is eternally for me. My purity will enable me to speak to Him, sing with Him and sport with Him here, there and all-where at every moment.</p>
<p>I wish to be free from self-imposition, self-exposition and self-exploitation. I shall not impose any more severe, ruthless austerity on my life, for that is not the right way. I shall not expose my ignorance-dream to the world at large any more. I shall not exploit myself any more. I have already exploited my Supreme's Compassion infinite. I have already exploited the world's abundant patience. I have already exploited my weak helplessness. But I shall not exploit God, I shall not exploit the world and I shall not exploit myself anymore.</p>
<p>I wish to be free from what I am in the outer world and from what I am in the inner world. Right now in the outer world I am a hopeless hope, and in the inner world I am a fruitless promise. I want to transform my hope-world into a reality-world, the reality which is fulfilment itself. I want to transform my fruitless promise into fruitful action. This I can do only on the strength of my sleepless inner cry. I can cultivate my inner cry only when I offer to my Beloved Supreme the most precious thing that He has granted me out of His infinite Bounty, and this most precious thing is the tiny flame of my gratitude-heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Experience and realisation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Experience and realisation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Experience prepares; realisation shares. Experience prepares the seeker for God's choice Hour. Realisation shares God with the seeker. Experience tirelessly tries and cries to find the goal. Realisation effortlessly lives in the goal and eventually grows into the goal itself. Experience secretly tells the seeker what he will ultimately become; he will become God's most perfect instrument. Realisation smilingly tells the seeker what he eternally is here on earth and there in Heaven. On earth he is God the aspiring and evolving man. In Heaven he is man the illumining and fulfilling God.</p>
<p>Experience is convinced of the fact that this world of ours is a battlefield. Here, bad and good, divine and undivine forces are constantly at war. Realisation knows that this world of ours is not a battlefield. It spontaneously knows that this world of ours is God's all-transcending Vision-Tree and God's all-nourishing Reality-Fruit.</p>
<p>Experience moves from the finite to the Infinite. It feels its presence in the finite first and then in the Infinite. It feels its sole identity with the finite drop and then with the infinite sea. Realisation swims right from the beginning inside the infinite sea with God the eternal Swimmer.</p>
<p>Each experience is an added strength in the process of our evolving life. While we are marching along Eternity's road, each experience is an added strength. Each realisation is a transcending triumph. While we are running fast, faster, fastest along Eternity's road, each realisation is a transcending triumph.</p>
<p>Experience is exceedingly fond of God the Compassion-Father. Realisation is exceedingly fond of God the Oneness-Lover.</p>
<p>Experience is our journey's birth. Realisation is our ever-transcending, ever-illumining and ever-fulfilling journey itself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">You are spiritual</h2><span property="dc:title" content="You are spiritual" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>You are spiritual. That means you have only a few desires, very, very few desires. One day you will come to the point where you will have only one desire: God. God-realisation will be your only desire. Only one desire will be left you, and that desire will be fulfilled by God Himself with the deepest Love, Joy and Pride.</p>
<p>You are spiritual. That means you are sincere. There are two types of sincerity. One is human sincerity, the mind's sincerity. The other is divine sincerity, the heart's sincerity. The human sincerity that you speak of comes from the most developed member of your human family, the mind. The mind tells you that this is sincerity, this is insincerity. The mind inspires or commands you to say the right thing, the sincere thing. But there is also something called the heart's sincerity. The heart's sincerity is a different matter. Heart's sincerity is oneness with the Will of the Supreme. Sometimes the mind is sincere, but only when the mind can get some profit or benefit from sincerity. Sometimes the mind is sincere because it feels an inner compulsion; it feels inwardly obliged. But in the heart's sincerity, which is oneness with the Supreme's Will, there is an inner, special purpose which the human mind cannot fathom. If you are spiritual, you will be ready eventually to unite your will with the Supreme's Will. That kind of sincerity you are aiming at.</p>
<p>You are spiritual. That means you are humble. Here humility means the acceptance of the world's burden according to your capacity. God is all Humility. He has accepted as His own lot the entire weight of the world. So you also accept the burden around you, according to your limited capacity. You are like a tree. The tree carries leaves, flowers, fruits and everything. You also can bear the burden of the world around you on your head and shoulders. This is your humility.</p>
<p>You are spiritual. That means you are secure. Security means that you feel the living Presence of God inside you, and you feel your living presence inside God. Also, you tell yourself that you are for God and that God is for you. When you tell yourself that God is for you and you are for God, and when you feel your presence inside God and God's Presence inside you, that is your security.</p>
<p>You are spiritual. That means you are pure. What kind of purity are you aiming at? You are aiming at the purity that will satisfy God and capture Him inside your heart, inside your mind, inside your vital and inside your body. All your impurity will leave you when God comes to live inside your body-room, vital-room, mind-room and heart-room. If you can feel that God is living inside you, then only can you develop real purity.</p>
<p>You are spiritual. That means you are divine. At first your divinity will say that there is no adamantine wall between you and God. You are facing God and God is facing you. Your divinity will make you feel that two Gods are facing each other and conversing. But eventually you will merge into the God that you are now facing. You will know there is only one God and that the entire world is His projection. Then there will come a time when God will ask you to play His role. He will make you feel that you are God and He is your projection. Then He will hide Himself and play the role of the universe, while you play the role of God. He becomes the creation and you become the Creator. You are God's creation according to His Vision, Mission and Necessity. But when He is fully satisfied with your spirituality, He says, "My son, I am changing the game. I shall become the creation and you become the Creator." This is how you become inseparably one with the Source who conceived of you and created you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Spirituality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Spirituality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Spirituality is man's conscious longing for God. Spirituality tells us that God, who is unknowable today, will tomorrow become knowable and, the day after, will become totally known.</p>
<p>We must need God for God's sake. God can fulfil us in our own way, but it is we who will not be truly fulfilled when God satisfies us in our own way. Our crying heart, our aspiring heart, our illumining heart, will never be satisfied unless and until it pleases God in God's own way; therefore, our God-realisation is for God's sake. Man's perfection lies in God-satisfaction.</p>
<p>A beginningless beginning tells us that spirituality is an aspiration-plant. This plant grows and grows; eternally it grows. An endless end tells us that spirituality is a surrender-tree. This tree bears divine fruits, and these fruits come to us on the strength of our constant, conscious and surrendered oneness with our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>True spirituality is our conscious acceptance of life, not the annulment, not the negation, not the annihilation of life. We must needs accept life and radically change the face of life into the very image of our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Spirituality says to the heart, "O heart, why do you remain insecure? Do you not feel that inside you the Almighty, the Lord Supreme, abides? You must not feel insecure, for it is you who can proclaim to the world at large that inside you is the living Presence of the Beloved Supreme. Of all the parts of the being, you have been chosen to be the first and foremost instrument to guide the mind, the vital and the body to the soul. The soul eventually will bring them to me."</p>
<p>Spirituality tells the mind to remain silent. It says to the mind, "O mind, do not think anymore. Your thinking power is nothing short of confusion. You confuse the other members of your family — body, vital and heart — and, at the same time, you are yourself confused when you indulge in the thought-world."</p>
<p>Spirituality says to the vital, "O vital, do not crave. Do not crave for name and fame. Do not crave for anything, for even if you possess the things that you crave, these possessions will not satisfy you. Even inside these possessions there will be a cry for more possessions. You will always act like a beggar if you crave for anything. No matter what you get, you will remain dissatisfied and unfulfilled. So do not walk along that path. Your craving must come to an end. Do not crave anything."</p>
<p>Finally, spirituality says to the body, "O body, how long will you sleep? Don't you know that you have been sleeping from time immemorial? It is because of your ignorance-sleep that the rest of the members of your family are not able to reach the Golden Shore, the destined Goal. O body, sleep not! The Goal is only for those who are awakened. Awake, arise! The rest of the members of your family will run faster than the fastest the moment you become active and dynamic and cast aside the shackles of ignorance-sleep."</p>
<p>Spirituality tells the seeker not to live in the hoary past, not to live in the remote future, but to live in the immediacy of today, in the eternal Now. This eternal Now embodies man the aspiring seed and God the all-nourishing Fruit.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Editor&#039;s preface to the first edition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Editor&#039;s preface to the first edition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>During the first twenty days of July 1977, Sri Chinmoy delivered one hundred short talks. These talks were given at his public esraj performances, at picnics, even at a local high school playground after morning sports practice. In very few ways, though, can these pieces really be called talks. They contain a rhythmic, almost musical quality more like blank verse than prose. More important, they express a flow of ideas so subtle and melodic that they cry out to be felt and assimilated on an intuitive plane. Before speaking, Sri Chinmoy would enter into a high meditative state and then speak extemporaneously. These talks, then, are expressions of a state of consciousness far beyond the mind's reach: short, illumining bursts of light from the Master's boundless Realisation-Sun. This particular volume is the first of a four-part series.</p>
