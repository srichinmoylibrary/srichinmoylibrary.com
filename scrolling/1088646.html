<h2>Question: Why is it easier to approach God through a Guru?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, the Supreme who is operating in and through you is only a vague idea to you. When you think of God, you may think that He is in beautiful trees or on top of mountains, or perhaps you will say that God is inside a cave or inside the ocean. If you think of God in this way, at any moment He may disappear and you will wonder where He has gone. When you think of me, that question does not arise. You know that I am in this house or at the store or at some familiar place. But when you think of God, you try to imagine whether He is in Heaven or hell and at the same time you have no idea what He actually looks like. But you know what I look like; I am something tangible. You can easily see me because I am on the physical plane. Immediately you can visualise me.</p>
<p>That is why they say that if you can go through the Master, you will be sure to reach the right place. It is much easier and safer to allow the Guru to go to God and bring God to you than to go to the Guru through God. If you try to go to God, the mind will doubt. If you make direct contact, you will misunderstand, but if you go through a Guru who can reassure you and convince you, you will believe it. Otherwise you will be full of doubt.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In this incarnation I have accepted you as my Guru. Will I have you as my Guru in my next incarnation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In this incarnation I have accepted you as my Guru. Will I have you as my Guru in my next incarnation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is an absolutely personal question, so I wish to tell you that in your case your soul has made a very, very, very close connection with my soul. I can assure you with all my soul's love, blessings and concern that I will be your Guru. But this is not so for everyone. The students have every right to change their teacher. Already I have ex-disciples here and there who belong to different groups and follow different teachers. I have no grudge against their new teachers; I am not jealous of them. So long as they are taking my former spiritual children to God, I am happy.</p>
<p>I also have disciples who have belonged to other Gurus in this incarnation. They have come to me for spiritual fulfilment. Sometimes their Gurus come to them during their meditation or during their sleep to tell them that they should come to me. So these seekers become my disciples. If the disciples that I have now want to change to another Guru in their next incarnation, I will have no objection. It depends on the disciple. If the disciple sincerely says, "I want to remain with you throughout Eternity," I will give him my assurance that I shall remain his Master. I say, "I shall take care of you, of your heart and soul, for all time." This has to be a mutual acceptance and a mutual promise. When the disciple makes the promise: "I want this Guru always to be my Guru," at that time the Guru may say: "Yes, I will keep you always as my close and dear disciple."</p>
<p>I have disciples already in Heaven. Do you think that because I am here on earth, I do not help them? Every day I help them. I have disciples, I have relatives, I have friends, I have my own parents there. A realised soul can enter any world and help any person in that world. Those who want this help, need this help, the Master is bound to help because he lives only to serve others.</p>
<p>Many people have started with a Guru and then their Guru has left the physical body. When a real spiritual Master leaves the body, he is not like an ordinary man who is "out of sight, out of mind." For him it is as if there is a wall between him and his disciples. He lives on one side of the wall and the disciples who are in the physical body live on the other side. The Guru sees his disciples because he has made a very big hole in the wall with his consciousness. An ordinary person does not see that hole; he only sees a solid wall.</p>
<p>In your case, since your promise to me is from your soul, you will get me in all your incarnations until you realise God. When you realise God, at that time you will not need me anymore, because you will also be in the infinite Consciousness. But until then, even if I do not come back into this world in the human body, I will be able to guide you from the other world as I am now helping people in the other worlds from earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a matter of my disagreeing or agreeing. I do not want to enter into any controversy with other spiritual Masters. I wish only to tell you what I feel. Life is creation. It is created by God. If there were no purpose, then God would not have created life as such.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to become a disciple of mine one has first of all to be very sincere and earnest. One has to feel that the spiritual life is not the life of pleasure and enjoyment: it is the life of sincerity, simplicity and perfection. Any seeker who is sincere is meant for the spiritual life. But a person may be extremely sincere and, at the same time, he may not be meant for our path.</p>
<p>Our path is the path of love, devotion and surrender. We do not say that because he is not following our path he is not fit for the spiritual life. Millions of people on earth are really fit for the spiritual life, but they are not meant for our path precisely because they do not care so much for the love, devotion and surrender that we want to practise in our lives. But they will be suitable for many other spiritual Masters and other spiritual paths.</p>
<p>Choosing a path is like choosing a college. Two colleges may be of an equally high standard, but one will be more suited to a particular student than another. Yet both are serving mankind with knowledge. In a similar way, ours is only one path, not the only path. It is one path that leads to the Goal. If you follow another path, definitely you will also reach your destination. The destination is always the same.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I can easily tell if a person is ready for me, if a person is meant for me. Even if the person is not meant for me, I can tell if the person is sincere or not. When somebody is sincere but not meant to be my disciple, I tell the person to go to somebody else, because I know that another Master will be of infinitely greater help to him than I will be.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If there are people interested in following my path, then I will see them and, if I feel that they are accepting me sincerely and that I can also accept them sincerely, then naturally I will accept them. It has to be a mutual acceptance. There are people whom I consider nice and sincere, but who do not care for my path. And again, there are people who are willing to follow my path but whom I unfortunately will not be able to accept. Even for these, however, I can be of some help. I have come to inspire people, and if there are people who see something in me, then they will benefit from my presence and my instruction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes yes and sometimes no. People come to us and say they are victims of occult forces, but they themselves practised occultism or black magic. They don't have the power to control these powerful forces, so when the forces they are invoking come and attack them, they cry to me to save them.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very unfortunate but true that a developed soul can be a witch. Somebody can be developed in purity, humility, or some other good qualities, but if he does not develop wisdom, then the danger is there. If a bad person invites someone who has purity and aspiration but no wisdom to come visit him, the other person may go and perhaps he will also become bad. So if wisdom is lacking, no matter how pure he was, he may do all kinds of undivine things. If a person is pure, that pure soul will become a better witch.</p>

Is that normal?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The things that we need will definitely be given to us by the Supreme. Only we have to know that there are things that we really need, and there are things that we only demand, or want. The things that we actually need, that the soul needs, or the heart needs, will always be granted. These real needs do not come from us: they come from the Source into us as an inspiration. Then, when this inspiration tries to manifest itself, it becomes our creation, our realisation, our achievement. But the very need comes to us in the form of inspiration from the Source. Your inner needs will definitely be fulfilled. But things that you want, if they are all fulfilled, will cause you great difficulty. By fulfilling our vital demands or desires, we only increase our difficulties.</p>
<p>Your experience is encouraging and inspiring. Here we come to know that God thinks of us more, infinitely more, than we think of ourselves. Sometimes we believe that we think of God more than He thinks of us, but this is absurd. Sometimes we believe that we think of ourselves more than God thinks of us. This is also absurd. We say, "God has created the whole creation. He has to think of infinite beings, and I am only a tiny particle. How can He think of me, or why should He think of me?" But, it is not like that in this case. God has the capacity to create infinite beings, and He also has the capacity to think of each and every one of them in His inimitable Way. We have to realise that He thinks of us infinitely more than we think of ourselves. After all, we are His instruments; God is not our instrument. We are His instruments, so naturally He has to think of us and care for us if He wants to perfect us.</p>

But when it is a matter of who is the real Master or Guru, I always say it is the Supreme. I am not the Guru. The Supreme is the only Guru.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here is a most difficult question. When can you get your name? When you are ready. When will you be ready? I will give you the name only when you are ready to feel that the name you get is the only name that will give you joy. The other day I was told a story about the five-year-old daughter of one of my disciples. Her mother and father still called her by her old name. Finally she said to her parents, "If you call me that old name once more I will get out of the house and stay out." Look at the joy this little girl gets from her soul's name.</p>
<p>Your name I will give you with joy and pride, but unfortunately the time has not come. If the time comes tomorrow, I will give you your name then. When your time comes I can even give you your name on the phone. For your brother, I did this. Now that you have asked me for your name, you do not have to tell me any more. It may take two months, it may take one year or it may take three days. When God tells me to give you your name, I will definitely do it. You will be waiting for that day and you will be happy when you get it.</p>

<h2>Question: How can I serve the Supreme in you more consciously?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to serve the Supreme in me more consciously, you have to remember one word all the time. That word is "expectation." If you expect something from me in your own way, if you think, "If I pray to Guru today most sincerely, tomorrow he may smile at me or say nice things about me to my sisters and brothers," then you will not be serving the Supreme in me. Never expect anything from me in your own way. This will be the very beginning of your most soulful service.</p>
<p>Most of you, if not all, make that deplorable mistake. Everybody expects something from me in his or her own way. You can expect something from me because after all you are giving me something in your aspiration. I will definitely give you something in return, but I will give in my own way. A God-realised person cannot be miserly, he cannot be mean, he cannot be indifferent. But if you think that just because you meditated two hours, that I will say something nice about you to somebody, or I will speak highly of you, then you are expecting something from me in your own way. You have to know that this is a mistake.</p>
<p>God wants to see how sincerely you want to dive into my spiritual path. Have you come here for recognition that you have meditated early in the morning or have gone out into the city to put up posters and all that? If recognition is wanted by you, then service is gone. Real service will die the moment it cries for recognition. In the very act of real service, inner recognition is there. The moment you do something soulfully for the Supreme, immediately my soul's tears of gratitude flow towards you. Even before you actually act, if you are just determined to do something for the Supreme, my gratitude comes. In action it may take you six months or six years to do it, but the very fact that you are determined to do something for God makes me more than happy, because there are billions of people on earth who do not consciously want to do anything for God.</p>
<p>From now on, whenever you do something, do not expect anything from me in your own way. If you do not expect anything at all, it is best, but it is usually impossible for human beings not to expect. You will say, "Why shouldn't he give to us, if we give to him?" But if a person has established an inner connection, inner oneness, then he need not expect anything. It is a spiritual Master's bounden duty to be of constant service to his disciples. You play your role with your aspiration: that is your service. The Master plays his role with his concern, compassion and feeling of oneness which will uplift your consciousness. Conscious service, if it is soulful, devoted and unconditional, does not need any recognition. The very fact that you are able to serve your Master consciously is your deepest joy and pride. But if it is difficult for you not to expect anything, then I wish to say that your expectation should be this: "Whatever he feels is best for me, he will give me in his own way, according to his own inner vision. I have played my part by giving him what I have — my aspiration. He will play his part by giving his realisation to me in God's own Way at God's Hour."</p>
<p>You do hundreds of things in the course of each day. When you get up early in the morning, before you leave your bed, you can take just one second to say, "Oh Supreme, make me unconditionally devoted to You so that I can serve You in Your own Way." Then, before you brush your teeth, before you take your shower, before you meditate, before you eat, you can repeat this. And as soon as you are through with each action you can do the same. Before and after every action if you consciously pray to serve the Supreme most devotedly and unconditionally, you will see that daily at least one hundred times you will be able to say this. Once you start offering this prayer, you will see all the different activities in your life before which you can repeat it. You can even do it after each different idea that comes into your mind. If an idea has come to you that you have to go to the Centre, you should say, "I must go there to be fully dedicated to my Master." If that idea comes to your mind before you enter the Centre, before you enter the meditation hall, then you will see your own progress. Each time you go to the Centre, if you think that you are going to see your Guru or to see your friends, then that is useless. Going to the Centre is necessary, but something is more necessary than just going to the Centre. Immediately you have to ask, "Why am I going there?" And your answer must be, "To realise God, to serve God, to serve my Master."</p>
<p>Each time you are about to do something, try to bring forward the reason why you are doing it. If you are studying, you should not think that perhaps I will ask you to teach somewhere. What you should feel is that when the time comes I will tell you. You should feel that your purpose for studying is to serve the Supreme in other human beings. If that idea comes into your mind, that you are studying to serve me, then you are doing the right thing. If you are studying only to secure high marks so that you will be able to teach at some college, that is not good. The high grades you are getting in your examinations should be so that you can serve the Supreme in me.</p>
<p>Before each action takes place, try to keep the ideal before your mind's eye. And what is that ideal? Your ideal is to realise God. What is your next ideal? Your next ideal is to serve God here on earth. Right from the morning, whenever you do something, you have to place before you the highest ideal. The highest ideal is to realise the Supreme, and after realisation to manifest Him. Each individual daily thinks of either God, themselves, their friends, or their enemies. These are the four things we think of. By enemies I do not necessarily mean any individual being. Your enemies are fear, doubt, anxiety, jealousy, and so on. These are all members of our family. We either meditate on God or we meditate on ourselves — our joys and sufferings — or we meditate on our friends, seeing that they are happy; or we think of the undivine, destructive and unlit qualities of others. But before doing anything, before meditating on your enemies, on your friends, or even on your Guru, think only of God. Then you will see that undivine thoughts and ideas cannot come. When any wrong idea comes into your mind, immediately think, "Oh, a thief is entering!" Then think of God, think of the divine soldier inside you that is God, and let Him protect you.</p>
<p>How can you serve the Supreme in me more consciously? Every second feel that I am observing. This is my last answer. Every moment I am observing you, not physically, but spiritually. The things that you would do in front of me to please me, like showing me your aspiration, your inner cry and your love for God, you will do. The things that you would not do in front of me, like telling lies, being jealous of someone, or cherishing doubt, you will not do. These undivine things you would not do right in front of me when I am looking at you, because you would feel — Guru is seeing my doubt, Guru is seeing my jealousy, Guru is seeing my fear. Always be conscious and aware of my inner guidance, and then you will be able to serve the Supreme in me most consciously.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I best please you, Guru?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I best please you, Guru?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can best please me by not doing the things that stand in the way of your pleasing me. If you are angry with your sister, feel that naturally this anger will enter into your Guru's heart. Think that this anger will immediately have a painful effect on my heart. Then immediately you will conquer your anger. Always do the thing that will not hurt me or harm me. You will please me most by not doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your bad consciousness is in your mind and your vital, and your love and devotion are in your heart and soul. Let us say you have a five-room apartment. In the heart and soul rooms you have all good qualities. Now, if you have a fire in one of the other rooms — in the body, vital or mind — then you should take water from the heart and soul rooms to put out the fire.</p>
<p>When I see you, I see all five rooms. I see the good qualities in your heart and soul and I see the unillumined rooms as well.</p>
