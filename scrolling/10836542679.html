<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not usually fat, but when a world war takes place, at that time He gets the opportunity to take off some of the heavy, unnecessary garments that He is wearing. When He removes these garments, then He loses weight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. God has in His Vision how much weight He is going to lose or at what point He will reach a goal, and then, when He reaches His goal, He will stop dieting. God is not going to diet eternally, for God is wise enough not to eat voraciously in a greedy manner like a hungry tiger. If He does so, then He pays the penalty. Therefore, He feels that wisdom has to dawn on Him. He will eat only nutritious food that has twenty calories so that He does not suffer from overweight again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the Supreme wants to lose His excess weight in the physical, then He adopts the physical process: He starves and starves. He takes not more than twenty calories a day for two weeks at least. And if He has to lose excess weight on the inner plane, then He does it by dint of His Will-power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God always likes to eat, not because He is always hungry but because He wants to please the person who has cooked or who has brought the food. There are two persons who bring food for Him. One is ignorance, one is wisdom. When ignorance says, "I have something for You to eat," God says, "Certainly, my son, I shall eat. That is what you have for me and that is what you are." When wisdom says, "Father, I have something for You to eat," God says, "Certainly, my son, I shall eat, for that is what you have and that is what you are." So God likes to please both His sons. He gets satisfaction by pleasing them, not by eating their food.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God does like ice cream because ice cream is the food of the human beings who love the childlike consciousness. God always treasures the child-consciousness; therefore, He likes ice cream. He eternally wants to remain in the child-consciousness. He is an eternal Child. Whatever a child likes, He also likes because that is the only way He can satisfy and please Himself. Because He is an eternal Child, He eternally likes ice cream.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has never picked black raspberries because God Himself is a raspberry. God wants His children, especially you, who have a great fondness for raspberries, to pick and enjoy. He is like a mother. The mother not only has the food; the mother becomes the food for her children. The mother not only has the compassion-food, the compassion-concern food, but the mother is compassion-food and concern-food for her children to eat to their heart's content.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, God loses His teeth if He neglects His teeth. Why does He do that? It is not because He is negligent in anything. Only at times, in a childlike manner He wants to enjoy the loss of something, as we always want to enjoy the gain of something.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God shaves every day because He gives all importance to His cleanliness. He believes in mutual appreciation. If He appreciates His creation because the creation remains clean and pure, then He is also expected to do the same. That is to say, He has to keep Himself clean and pure. God tells us that appreciation is nothing short of our inner and outer self-expansion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's favourite toy is His top. He spins the top. While His top is spinning, while it is in motion, He feels that He Himself is being rotated in His inner worlds and His outer world, carrying His children in His universal Cry and transcendental Smile.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If God assumes a human body and looks at human beings, and if His human eyes need glasses to see other people or other objects, if it is purely the need of the physical, then He will accept material objects, for the physical body and the material world must go together, just as the spiritual and the material must go together. The physical is His and the material world is also His. Therefore, He has to abide by the laws of the material world, the physical world. In the inner plane He does not have to use glasses because He uses His third eye. His third eye pierces the length of the past, present and future all at once. It covers the past, present and future at His sweet Will. Therefore, it is not necessary for Him to wear glasses for His third eye. His third eye is all Vision, all-pervading Vision.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When God walks about in Heaven, does everyone recognise Him?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When God walks about in Heaven, does everyone recognise Him?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, everybody recognises God when He walks about in Heaven, but there are degrees of recognition. Here on earth when a great person is recognised by a multitude of people, one will recognise him at a particular plane of consciousness with much more capacity than another. Each one will recognise his capacity, undoubtedly, but the extent of his capacity will not be recognised on the same level by all and sundry. One will see his capacity to one extent, another will see it to another extent. Each will have his dimension, intensity, shade and colour of recognition.</p>
<p>In Heaven also, the souls will undoubtedly recognise God, but the ordinary souls will not be able to recognise God's eternal Capacity in infinite measure the way developed souls will recognise God's Capacity. It is like the eldest son and the youngest son recognising their father. The older son will recognise the father's capacity more than the younger one will. The younger son will only say, "Oh, he is very great." He has to develop his consciousness. Only then will he know what contribution his father has made in his field to the world. Similarly, in the inner world God will be recognised, but not at the same level by each and every individual soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has not one but three oldest friends. Their names are Sat-Chit-Ananda: Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. This is a triune Consciousness. If you want to separate them, you can call them Existence, Consciousness and Bliss in three different planes. Here is one thing — Existence; here is one thing — Consciousness; here is one thing — Bliss. In this case you can say that God has three dearest friends, three oldest friends, and they are Sat, Chit and Ananda. Again, these three friends of His are eternally inseparable. They are bosom friends, or you can say, they are only one friend called by three different names by different individuals. The father is called by his children in one way, by his friends in another way and by his wife in another. In the same way, if one wants to see Existence-Consciousness-Bliss as three different entities or realities, one can. But if one wants to see Existence-Consciousness-Bliss in one form, one reality and one vision, then God's only friend is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In spite of knowing perfectly well that he and God are inseparable — eternally, constantly and inseparably one — the spiritual Guide constantly tells mankind who God is or shows mankind where God is. Consciously he leads mankind to God the Source, and he himself remains as the guide or the messenger boy. In spite of knowing that he and God are inseparable, eternally inseparable, he makes earth feel that he is the messenger of God and that he is leading the earth-consciousness somewhere else, where God is. He does not say that he himself is with God or in God. But when the seeker reaches the Goal, at that time he sees God and the Guide together as one.</p>
