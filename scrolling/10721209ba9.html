<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have the same goal but they take different roads. By writing an essay, one person gets tremendous joy; he feels a sense of accomplishment. Somebody else gets tremendous joy by playing a piece of music. This joy has tremendous intensity and the person’s whole body is permeated by inner joy. On the strength of that joy one walks along the road to the highest Goal. When you write a story, let us say, and you feel that you have really accomplished something, the joy that you get from your creativity is the speed with which you march or run toward your goal. And the joy that somebody else gets from playing a piece of music is the speed with which he goes to his goal. The goal is the same, but as a poet or an artist or a musician you will take a different road, depending on which plane you receive your inspiration from.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have something within yourself and if you are appreciating it, then you have to know whether it is God’s Will that you offer it to others. If you feel from within that the hour has not struck for you to share your experience with others, if the Supreme within you tells you just to appreciate it yourself and keep it for yourself for the time being, that does not mean you will be acting like a miser. No! It is only that the hour has not struck for you to share it with anybody. The Supreme wants you to accumulate and amass more of this power of appreciation within yourself; He wants you to perfect it. Again, if it is God’s will that you offer it, and if you do not offer it to the right person, then you are making a mistake. You always have to know what the Will of the Supreme is. If the time has come for you to share your experience, you share it and if it is not time, then you keep it for yourself. That is the right thing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you are writing a poem or a song, do you sometimes invoke the soul of another great artist and use his capacities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you are writing a poem or a song, do you sometimes invoke the soul of another great artist and use his capacities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to write like Shakespeare, if his soul is still in the soul’s world and if you can invoke the soul and reach it, the soul may give you some of its capacities. This is absolutely true. Or if the person is still alive, you can also invoke the soul. But just by invoking the soul of a great writer or singer, for instance, you cannot get his highest achievements. Before you sing, if you pray to the Supreme and say, “Now I am going to sing. I will be so grateful to You if You give me a most soulful voice like he has or she has,” that is the most effective method. If you try to invoke the soul of someone who is a good singer, your mind may immediately think of his or her undivine qualities. You know that somebody sings well, but you may not be able to appreciate that particular person’s inner life. You only appreciate a certain capacity which you want, but your physical mind is so bad that it will not allow you to separate the person’s soul from his life on the physical plane. You want to think of the soul, but immediately the body comes before your mind. And when the body comes, immediately you think twenty bad things about the person, so you don’t derive much help from him.</p>
<p>Pray to the Supreme, placing the Supreme in front of you. Say, “Supreme, I am praying to You to give me the singing capacity of so and so.” At that time, you are putting the Supreme in between you and the other person whose excellent voice you want to have. Then you do get capacity, and this capacity will not be of any harm to you. But this does not mean that you will get the same capacity or the same height as the other person. In India before soldiers go to fight they think of Bhima or Arjuna or some other world-renowned warrior. They do this to get strength and valour. But what often happens is something else. Bhima was very strong and powerful but, at the same time, he had many undivine qualities. These undivine qualities also may come into you along with his strength when you invoke him. But if you pray to Lord Krishna and ask for the capacity of Bhima, then Krishna will be able to give you only Bhima’s divine qualities; and according to your receptivity you will take them. This is quite possible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is the supreme form of art. There cannot be any art superior to aspiration. If one aspires wholeheartedly, then God is most pleased and, at the same time, fulfilled. Nature’s aspiration, individual aspiration, universal aspiration are what satisfy God most. If the entire being aspires — body, vital, mind, heart and soul, then God is most pleased, satisfied and most fulfilled.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you create a piece of art, immediately it adds to reality in terms of inspiration, in terms of capacity, in terms of beauty. If the artist is sincere and devoted, then each time he creates he is offering new life, ever-continuous and ever-transcending life, and entering into Immortality. A seeker deals with eternal Life, infinite Life. If the artist is a seeker, then he is constantly creating new life which is becoming one with Infinity and Eternity. If he is a seeker, then he is creating something in infinite measure, or entering into something infinite and eternal. But if the artist is not a seeker, in his art he will only be adding a tiny drop to the existing capacity of creation. If he is not a seeker, then he is like a child who adds one dollar to his father’s million dollars. His contribution is infinitesimal, but still it does add something.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you enjoy art with your heart’s love, then automatically you are getting inspiration from it. But if you enjoy it with your mind, then you are stuck there. You are only measuring the art, judging it. At that time, even if you enjoy it, still the art does not come as an inspiration. But if you enjoy it with your heart, you are identifying yourself with the work. Your heart receives the inspiration from the art because oneness is there. That inspiration is now inside you and is being transformed into aspiration. Tomorrow it will be revelation and manifestation.</p>
<p>If you are enjoying with your heart, there is identification; but if you are enjoying with your mind, even while you are appreciating it you are cherishing the feeling that you yourself could paint that thing or write that thing better than the artist. With the mind you are enjoying plus examining and judging. When enjoyment and examination go together, you won’t be able to take the work as inspiration, because at that time you are busy judging and correcting it. You are enjoying it but you are also showing your superior feeling by trying to correct and perfect it. But if you enjoy it with your heart of identification, you automatically receive the inspiration in the creation of the artist. In the heart, you identify with the inspiration and sooner or later that inspiration will reveal itself as a new form of creation in your own life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we best help the supreme Artist in His art?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we best help the supreme Artist in His art?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The way to help the supreme Artist, who is the Supreme, is through consciously praying for His Victory. There cannot be any greater service. Let us use the term ‘service’ rather than ‘help’. If we say ‘help’, immediately ego comes forward. But how are we going to help the Supreme, who has everything and is everything? When we say ‘service’, then we get a sense of devotion, a sense of identification. When we take our prayer as service, He is proud of us, but when we take it as help, then we ourselves become proud.</p>
<p>The moment we say, “O Supreme, may Thy Victory be proclaimed in me and through me at every second throughout Eternity,” at that moment we have to feel that we are serving the Supreme. The best service we will be able to give Him is to pray constantly that His Victory should be proclaimed in and through us, in and through our dear ones and in and through each individual on earth. If we have that kind of constant prayer, then we are serving the supreme Artist best.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! The ultimate goal lies only in pure spirituality. Spirituality here means Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. Spirituality is one’s own reality. If one does not ultimately reach his own reality, then he is always a failure. So the ultimate goal of any artist, no matter what kind of artist he is, is spirituality — if he has any ultimate goal as such. That is because spirituality is the only reality which embodies Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. The artist can achieve that goal through his artistic expression while remaining in the highest consciousness. Spirituality does not mean staying inside a cave or on top of the Himalayas. It does not mean praying and meditating in some corner. No! Spirituality means the divine fulfilment of life, the divine revelation and divine manifestation of life. Life in its full blossom is called spirituality. Life has to be blossomed petal by petal and then, when it becomes a real flower, it is called spirituality. The divine smile in us, the Smile of the Supreme, has to be manifested. When it is manifested, we call it spirituality. Spirituality means accepting life in every form and seeing at every second the Creator creating and dancing in each action. Every second we have to feel that inside us the Supreme is dancing. He is dancing because He is achieving something and becoming something in and through us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why are some people hungry for God-realisation, while others are not? You are hungry for God-realisation: that is why God is giving you this food. If you were not hungry, then God would not feed you. These things depend entirely on one’s inner hunger. Some people feel the necessity of developing artistic capacities and some people don’t, just as some people want to become poets while others want to become singers.</p>
<p>You may ask why God did not give the same hunger to everybody. The answer is that God gave us limited freedom, and with that limited freedom some people said that they did not care to become musicians or singers or artists. But others felt that artistic capacity was something very good, very great, and very necessary in their lives. It depends on individual choice. Limited freedom we are given. With that freedom somebody will practise for twenty hours a day to become a musician and somebody else will spend his time reading the newspapers and watching television. If you spend your time reading The New York Times or the Daily News, you will get world information, but you will not become a great musician. Opportunity is given; time is also given. But you are using the time for one purpose and somebody else is using the same time for another purpose. With this limited freedom and limited opportunity, he is aiming at a particular goal which he will eventually reach. It depends entirely on your inner hunger and what you want to become.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dance, theatre and music are meant to help the world’s progress. Aspiration is bound to be followed by realisation, and realisation is bound to be followed by manifestation. If the performers do everything with a divine attitude to inspire and elevate the audience in some way, then certainly it helps the audience’s progress. Otherwise, the wrong motive of the performers and the wrong motive of the audience cannot be of any help to the world’s progress. Again, the inspiration that the audience gets today must be expanded tomorrow to a higher and deeper truth, which we call aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to remember at each moment that you are not the doer you are only the instrument. While you are in the kitchen touching the stove, you have to feel that it is not you who is touching the stove; it is somebody within you who is touching the stove. Always you have to identify yourself with some inner reality, some higher reality, the thing that is really divine in you. Right now when you think of yourself, you immediately think of all your imperfections. But when you think of yourself, you have to think that somebody divine is operating in and through you, and that you are just an instrument. If you can feel this, then automatically the realisation of that somebody within you becomes yours. When you think of yourself as the representative or conscious channel of somebody who is all Wisdom and all Light, and that He is acting in and through you, then immediately you will see that everything you do and touch is leading you to your destined goal.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you touch a material object which you consider undivine, and if you as an individual think of yourself as undivine, then there are two undivine, sick soldiers together. You have to feel that something within you is really strong, divine and beautiful, and that that very thing is utilising you to fulfil itself. If you become an expression or instrument of the divine within you, then everything that you touch or do will be a new discovery for you; everything will have new life for you at every moment. Your actions will not seem menial; they will not seem monotonous or mechanical. No, no, no! Each time you touch something you will give life to it and it will give new life to you. New inspiration, new life will enter into and flow out of whatever you touch. At that time you will be singing the song of ever-expanding life and ever-transcending life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can listening to music raise one’s consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can listening to music raise one’s consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you listen to and identify yourself with spiritual music, music from the heart and soul, naturally it will raise your consciousness. But if you listen to ordinary vital music, then it will lower your consciousness. Soulful music already has its own height. While you are listening you identify with it so, like a magnet, it pulls you up. Already the height is there. If somebody has already gone to the top floor of a building, it means that there is a staircase. You have to identify yourself with the staircase and also with the person who has already climbed up it. Then only will he be able to show you how he climbed up and where the staircase is. Appreciation means identification. If you become one with the staircase and also with the person who has created the staircase for you in his music, then you also can reach the top floor.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The supreme goal of art is Self-discovery or God-realisation and life-perfection. We know what God-realisation is. What is life-perfection? Life-perfection is unconditional and constant surrender to God’s Will, the Will of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme wants us to learn gratitude, a sense of constant gratitude. This gratitude does not only expand itself, but it also expands our consciousness. Each divinely inspired artistic creation is a clear indication of the expansion of our aspiring, God-reaching and God-manifesting consciousness.</p>
