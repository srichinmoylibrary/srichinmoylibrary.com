<p>While I was in Scotland recently, Janaka, Janani and I went running. David was following us in his car. After each mile David would honk. After three or four miles Janani surrendered. She started going very slowly.</p>
<p>I was proud that Janani was far behind us, because I still remember how she defeated me in Antigua. Altogether Janaka and I ran seven miles. Then we drove back to get Janani. She was so happy to stop running!</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to an Indian restaurant, but unfortunately the food was very bad.</p>

<p>On another day in Scotland I wanted to run my seven miles for the day. I ran with Janaka for three and a half miles. Two and a half miles were all hills that we had to really climb. Janani and David were watching us run.</p>
<p>Then we came to such a steep hill! It went straight up. We saw one man run about a hundred metres up the hill and we were admiring him. I also wanted to run up that hill, but the Scottish disciples were saying that the road was not good enough to run on.</p>

<p>The Scottish disciples showed me a place where they had taken Nemi a few years ago to show her the scenery, but Nemi hadn't liked it. It is a place where they run, near the water, and it is very beautiful. I liked it very much. I went running there along the water.</p>

<p>In Scotland they have a thirteen-mile course which has five hills. Once a year they have a race there. Some of the runners there are so strong and they do so well. Other people just deceive everyone because it is easy to take a short cut or to start somewhere along the course.</p>

<p>Another day in Scotland there was a two-and-a-half-mile race. At the finish, the boy who stood first was at least five hundred metres ahead of the person who was second. The second one was about a hundred metres ahead of the third. Such a difference!</p>

<p>I am a clever man. I ran seven miles before our five-mile race started so that I could enjoy watching the race. While I was running, a huge dog was following me. Then another dog was bothering me. A videotape was made, and it shows the dogs bothering me.</p>

<p>Over two hundred people ran in our five-mile race. Many were excellent runners. How fast they ran! One had been in the Commonwealth Games. He did a 4:22 pace and came in first. The second runner was far behind him and the third was far behind the second.</p>
<p>Abarita was the fifth over-all. For the first mile Abarita ran with the top runners. I was so happy. Then, at the second mile, he fell behind. He could not keep up with them. Among the disciples Abarita was the first boy and Indu was the first girl. The girl who stood first over-all was far ahead of Indu. She was quite fat, but she was such a fast runner!</p>

<p>Devashishu is going to be an excellent runner. He ran a seven-minute pace in the five-mile race, and a six-thirteen in a two-mile race. His father was so far behind him!</p>
<p>Everybody thought that Devashishu's little brother, Aaron, had got lost, but he was running at an eleven or twelve-minute pace. When the father finished, he ran back to find Aaron, and then he started running with him. They were coming towards the finish line together so I said, "Now let us have the physical father and the spiritual father run together with the son." So I was on one side and his father was on the other. Aaron was killing himself to beat us. I stopped deliberately to let him go ahead, and he was so delighted that he could defeat me. But his father didn't stop.</p>

<p>Hashi has done two unforgivable things. In the Long Island Marathon I got such a leg cramp and mental cramp at nineteen miles, and she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>Then, in the ten-mile race a week later, I was about to catch her, but then she disappeared and defeated me.</p>

<p>Once I was running in Flushing Meadow Park in such a relaxed way. I thought that my strides were no more than forty inches, but they were actually fifty. Savyasachi was watching.

<p>This morning around six-thirty I was doing interval work. At one point I had stopped running at the end of my block and I was walking. The German lady who lives nearby came up to me, grabbed my shoulder with her left hand and massaged my arm down to my elbow. Then she shook hands with me — her left hand and my left hand. She said, "Too cold, too cold!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "You have two dogs."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "Good, very good."</p>
<p>I asked her, "What is your dog's name?"</p>
<p>She said, "Vila."</p>
<p>This lady is always walking her dog. So its name is Vila, like the tennis champion Vilas.</p>

<p>This morning I ran four miles and then walked one mile. I wanted to do seven miles, but I didn't have the time.</p>
<p>When I was coming back from my run around four-thirty, at the thousand-metre mark what did I see? A policeman jogging. He had no car and he was not running to catch any thief. He had a radio with earphones and he was in his police uniform. He was a real policeman, with a badge and a gun. He was not someone joking or pretending.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw him, I smiled at him. Then he said to me either, "Sri" or "Shrai" — I could not hear very well — "Good morning!"</p>
<p>When I said to him, "Sir, good morning," he stopped and shook hands with me. He was very fat and very tall at the same time.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had seen a policeman jogging. He was going very, very slowly. What he was doing jogging at that hour, God alone knows.</p>

<p>I ran ten and a half miles before the San Francisco Marathon started. Then I was in the car while X and others started running the actual race. I watched them run for several miles. Then I ran six and a half miles in the marathon.</p>
<p>At the seventeen-mile point, Y said to me, "X is coming up behind you."</p>
<p>I said, "Let me enter into the car. Take me at least two miles ahead of her."</p>
<p>So Y took me about two miles in the car, but she couldn't go any farther because of the beach. Then I started running very peacefully. After that, I saw Z running in the other direction. Then I saw X coming from a different direction and she was shouting to Z.</p>
