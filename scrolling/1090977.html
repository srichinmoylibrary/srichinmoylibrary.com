  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I used to feel and see a golden light around my heart, but now I no longer do. How can I regain this wonderful presence?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I used to feel and see a golden light around my heart, but now I no longer do. How can I regain this wonderful presence?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let me start with the words "golden light." Each light has its significance. Golden light actually comes from a level of consciousness which we term the supermind. The supermind is infinitely higher than the physical mind. Above the physical mind is the abode of intuition, the overmind, and above the overmind is the supermind. The golden light descends from the supermind.</p>
<p>This golden light has a special significance. Golden light is divine manifestation. When this light of divine manifestation comes down and touches the earth-consciousness, it becomes red. Sometimes the light recedes if it feels that it is unable to stay in the heart due to lack of purity. When the heart is not pure it is impossible for the light to stay indefinitely. When the heart is pure, this light first functions most properly and satisfactorily in the heart region, and then it moves into the vital and the physical.</p>
<p>If you do not see this light, do not be depressed. It is functioning on another level of consciousness. When a beginner sees light, he feels that he is making extraordinary progress. To some extent, it is true. If God gives you light, naturally you will try to dive deep into the sea of spirituality. But if God feels that light is not required and that what you need is peace, then He will act through you in a different way. In you, because of your abundant purity, the light still abides. Now it is working inside your vital and sometimes it comes into the physical. To regain the visible presence of light is not necessary. If you want to follow the spiritual path, it is not the light that you want — it is God's constant Concern for you, God's real Love and God's Blessing. When you have God's Concern it can take the form of Light or Peace or Power.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to please God in God's own Way. You can ask, on the strength of your surrender, "God, make me anything You want so I can be Your instrument." You are trying to regain the wonderful presence of this light. But you will not get utmost satisfaction from seeing this light because you are not fulfilling God in His own Way. If you want the Grace of God, I can pray to God on your behalf and I assure you, you will get back the golden light. But it will not please you because you know that the highest aim is to please God in His own Way. When God gives us an experience, weshould be most grateful to Him. And when He does not give us one, we have to be equally grateful, because He knows what is best for us. It is your business to meditate faithfully, wholeheartedly and soulfully, and God's business is to give you Light or Blessings or Peace or Power. God will give you what He has and what He is if you give Him what you have and what you are. What you have is ignorance and what you are is aspiration. So my request to you is to please God in His own Way and not to care for the thing that you once had and which now you are missing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Yesterday when I was meditating, I got a message from the silence which said, &quot;Love one another.&quot; When we get this kind of message in our meditation, should we meditate on it and take it into ourselves?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Yesterday when I was meditating, I got a message from the silence which said, &amp;quot;Love one another.&amp;quot; When we get this kind of message in our meditation, should we meditate on it and take it into ourselves?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we get a message in our mind during meditation, we have to know whether it is in the lower mind, the physical mind — the restless, aggressive, destructive and doubtful mind — or in the calm mind, the vacant mind, the silent mind. When we receive a message in the silent mind, we should accept it and feel that it is the foundation stone on which we can build the Palace of Truth, Love, Divinity and Reality. This message actually originates in the soul or in the heart, and then enters into the mind. When the mid is absolutely still, calm and peaceful, we can hear that message.</p>
<p>Suppose you are meditating and after a few minutes there comes to your mind a thought which is divine, progressive, encouraging, inspiring. Please try to feel that these kinds of thoughts are like tender roots — roots of infinite Light and Bliss — and try to let your body, mind, heart and soul grow with these roots. Let us say that during your meditation you get a thought about sacrifice, that you will sacrifice something for a friend or relative or someone you know. This is not just an idea at that time; it is an ideal. When you accept an idea as your own, the idea does not remain an idea but becomes an ideal.</p>
<p>So build your life of love on this thought that came to you. Love is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. This is the love which permits us to see that all human beings are God. If we truly love God we love all mankind as well. We cannot separate divine Love from man and God. Man and God are like a tree. If you go to man, the foot of the tree, with your divine Love, from there it is very easy to go up to God, the top of the tree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Well, you have to know that that thing inside you is absolutely right. Your soul, your purest soul, will always tell you that if you want to realise God, it has to be to please God and not to please yourself. Of course it is better to want to realise God for your own reasons than not to want to realise God at all. Millions and billions of people are sleeping and snoring spiritually. At least those who want God for themselves are not sleeping. But you have to know that they want to realise God because they feel that God will then give them something to make them happier. But the real aspirant says, "I don't want happiness, I don't want anything. I only want what God gives me. I love Him wholeheartedly, I want to please Him in His own way. If He wants to give me all kinds of problems, if that is His Will, then let Him give me millions of problems. But if He wants me to be without problems, so that I can think of Him and meditate on Him all the time, then I shall be equally happy." A real seeker will try to please God in God's own way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we discipline the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we discipline the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to feel that you have no mind at all, but only the soul. If you cannot feel the presence of your soul, you can easily feel the presence of your heart. Let your heart's Light flow through your entire being. When this happens, you can rest assured that you have transcended the intellectual, reasoning mind and entered into the illumined mind.</p>
<p>When Light grows in the heart or comes out of the soul and permeates the entire body, then the mind is automatically disciplined. It you want to discipline the mind by wishful thinking or by force, it is impossible. It is just like trying to straighten the tail of a dog for good. If you can live in the soul or even in the heart, then the Light of the inner existence either transforms the physical mind into a higher region or brings down the all-fulfilling Peace from above into the gross physical mind. When Peace descends into the mind or the mind ascends into the higher domain of Light, the mind as you know it automatically disappears.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on what kind of meditation it is. If one is a beginner, when he sees something, immediately he will be disturbed. If a beginner is meditating and right in front of him there is a cat moving around, his attention will be diverted. Anything, even the slightest noise, will affect his meditation.</p>
<p>But if one is advanced, very advanced, he will be aware of things happening, but he will not be disturbed. If it is the highest type of meditation, then one goes deep within and there one sees everything that is happening, but he is not disturbed by anything external. Within and without, one is aware of what is happening, but at the same time one is not affected at all.</p>
<p>If it is the highest type of meditation, one will not be disturbed even if someone pinches him, because at that time he is not in the body, but in the soul. When the consciousness is in the physical, if somebody is pinched, immediately he feels pain. But if his consciousness is in the soul, if he has become one with the soul, he will not be affected.</p>

How can I fight against them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During your meditation, do not fight against evil thoughts. If you constantly fight against evil thoughts, to your wide surprise you will only strengthen them. But if you open yourself to divine thoughts, evil thoughts will find no use for you. They will be terribly jealous of your divine thoughts and will in no time leave you.</p>
<p>During your meditation, try to cultivate divine Love. Try to love humanity soulfully. You may say: "How can I love others when I do not know how to love myself?" I will tell you how you can love yourself. You can love yourself most successfully just by loving God unreservedly. You may ask: "How can I love God when I do not know what love is?" My immediate answer is: "Love is the transforming power in our human nature. Love transforms our life of stark bondage into the life of mightiest freedom. Love cries for life. Love fights for life. Finally, Love grows into the Life Eternal."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should you reject all thoughts during meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should you reject all thoughts during meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know whether it is a good thought or a bad thought, a divine thought or an undivine thought. If it is a thought of God or a thought of Divine Joy, Divine Love, Beauty, Purity, then allow that thought to enter into you and let it play, let it expand. Or if it is a thought about Grace, Divinity, Infinity, Eternity or Immortality, please try to see where the thought goes; try to follow that thought like a faithful dog.</p>
<p>Say you are standing inside your house by the door. It is up to you to open the door, your mental door, and allow in only those divine thoughts that will encourage you, inspire you, uplift your consciousness. They are your friends. If you see that your friends are outside wanting to come in, immediately you will allow them in. But if you see your enemies there — doubt, fear, jealousy, anxiety, worry — you will not let them in.</p>
<p>But again, if you have enough inner strength, when an undivine thought comes into your mind you will not reject it; you will transform it. It is like this. Somebody has knocked at your door. If you know that you have enough strength to compel him to behave properly once he enters, then you can open the door and allow him to come in. But if you do not have the power to compel him to behave, then it would be wise to keep your door closed. Let it remain closed for a day or for a month or for a year. When you gain more strength, then accept the challenge and open the door. For if these wrong thoughts are not conquered, they will come back to bother you again and again. First you reject, then you accept and transform, then finally you totally transcend.</p>
<p>We have to be a divine potter with the dirty clay of our thoughts. If the potter is afraid to touch the clay, if he refuses to touch it, then the clay will remain clay and the potter will not be able to offer anything to the world. But the potter is not afraid. He touches the clay and shapes it in his own way into something beautiful and useful. It is our bounden duty to transform undivine thoughts. But when? When we are in a position to do it safely. If I am not a potter, what can I do with a lump of clay? If I touch it, I will only make myself dirty.</p>
<p>However, if one is a beginner, he should not allow any thought to enter his mind at all. He would like to allow his friends to enter, but he does not know who his friends are. And even if he does know who his friends are, when he opens the door for them he may find that his enemies are standing right in front of them, and before his friends can cross the threshold, his enemies are deep inside the room. Once the enemies enter, it is very difficult to chase them out. For that he needs the strength of solid spiritual discipline. For fifteen minutes he may cherish divine aspiration, spiritual thoughts and then, in just a fleeting second, an undivine thought will enter in and his meditation will be ruined. So the best thing is not to allow any thoughts during the meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are not in meditation, you will see that each thought or idea is composed of words. You are having an idea, and if you enter into the idea you will see that you are formulating the idea with words — words inside your mind or outside your mind. One, two, three, four words come and form a sentence, and there you have an idea. But during meditation, if the meditation is deep, you do not need words in order to form an idea. In deep meditation the idea comes in a flash. Words will not convey it. The idea will come in the form of Light, or Light will bring an idea right in front of your vision. You will see immediately the incident or the truth that you want to envision in your life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Always when I try to go beyond the mind, it says, &quot;No, carry me with you. I want to go there, too.&quot;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Always when I try to go beyond the mind, it says, &amp;quot;No, carry me with you. I want to go there, too.&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a very good thing when the mind tells you to carry it with you. But you have to know what "you" means. At that time, "you" means your intense aspiration. You have become one with your aspiration, and inside your aspiration what looms large is your soul. When you have become one with your soul, you try to go beyond the mind. Now at that time, if the mind says, "Please carry me," you have to ascertain whether the mind is asking devotedly or with a kind of demand such as this: "I have helped you all this time and now you are going beyond me. You have to take me with you." If it is this demanding mood that wants to be carried with you into the regions of the soul, it is very bad. If it goes there, it will only create problems for you. It will say, "No, no, this place is very unpleasant. Come down, come down. We experienced much more happiness down there. Come down." But if it is the devoted mind that wants to go with you to the Transcendental Beyond, it will not create any problems for you. It will cry for your illumination and transformation along with you.</p>
<p>To the demanding mind, you have to say, "No, you have created enough problems for me and now if I go into a room that is all Light, you will extinguish the Light and make it dark again. You will create problems for me no matter where I go. If I go to Heaven, you will create hell for me there."</p>
<p>But the devoted mind will be ready to accept the Light. True, it has created problems for you in the past. But this time the devoted mind says, "I have tortured you for a long time. I am very sorry. Forgive me. Now I want to go to the place where you are going. I want to share the Light with you. I, too, want to grow into the Light. I, too, want to become a conscious instrument of the Light."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: For the past year I have been practising concentration and meditation with my attention focused on my navel chakra. But I don&#039;t seem to be making as much progress as I would like in controlling my thoughts. Have you got any suggestions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: For the past year I have been practising concentration and meditation with my attention focused on my navel chakra. But I don&#039;t seem to be making as much progress as I would like in controlling my thoughts. Have you got any suggestions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you are doing is extremely good. We have six spiritual centres in the body. You are concentrating on the centre which is called <em>manipura</em>. This is the centre that usually is given most importance in Zen practice. From this centre, according to our Indian spiritual teachings, you get dynamic energy. If you use this divine energy for divine purpose, then you create. It you use it for an aggressive purpose, then you destroy.</p>
<p>Now if you want to control your thoughts, you should concentrate on the centre between the eyebrows. If you become very stiff and your concentration is intense, then you should not concentrate here for more than two minutes. Otherwise, you will become exhausted in the beginning. Now it you concentrate on the heart centre, you will get peace, love and joy. Try to hear the cosmic sound, the soundless sound, when you enter into the heart. If you bring love, joy, peace and bliss up from the heart to the centre between the eyebrows, then you will see that there will be no thoughts.</p>
<p>The heart is the safest place for you to concentrate and meditate. If you do this, automatically you will get purification because inside the heart is the soul, and the soul is one with the infinite. It is from here that you will get everything.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do you want us to meditate in the heart? I find it easier to meditate in the mind.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do you want us to meditate in the heart? I find it easier to meditate in the mind." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you find it easier in the mind, then meditate in the mind. But if you do so, you will be able to meditate for perhaps five minutes, and out of that five minutes, for one minute you may meditate very powerfully. After that you will feel your whole head getting tense. First you get joy, satisfaction, but then you may feel a barren desert. For five minutes you will get something, but if you want to go on beyond that, you may feel nothing. If you meditate here, in the heart, a day will come when you will start getting satisfaction.</p>
<p>You have to be wise. There is a vast difference between what you can get from the mind and what you can get from the heart. The mind is limited; the heart is unlimited. When you meditate on the heart, you feel a sense of delight, a sense of oneness with something vast and infinite. In the heart there is infinite Light, Peace and Bliss. Other centres in the body have these qualities too, but the place where you can get them in abundant measure is in the heart. So you have to be wise. If you are hungry, you go to the kitchen for food, not the bedroom. Even though there may be a very small amount of food in the bedroom also, when you are really hungry you immediately go to the kitchen for food. Similarly, if you want a limited quantity of Light, Peace and Bliss, meditation in the mind can give it to you. But you can get infinitely more when you meditate in the heart. Suppose you have the opportunity to work at two places. At one place you will earn $500, and at the other place $200. Naturally you will not want to waste your time at the second place.</p>
<p>If you concentrate on the mind, you will not get what you want, because you have gone to the wrong place. Inner aspiration does not come from the mind. It comes directly from your heart. Aspiration is the harbinger of realisation; aspiration is the seed of realisation. Aspiration comes from the heart because the illumination of the soul is always there. True, the Light and the consciousness of the soul permeate the whole body, but there is a specific place where the soul resides most of the time. Reality is everywhere, but the actual manifestation of the Reality has to be in a particular place. It is like my situation now. I am here at the United Nations. If someone asks, "Where is Chinmoy?" you can say that I am at the United Nations, or you can say that I am in Conference Room 10. My presence is spiritually pervading the entire United Nations, but my living consciousness is right here in this room. If you come here, I will be able to do more for you than for others who are elsewhere in the building. Similarly, when you focus your concentration in the heart, you get much more inner satisfaction than when you meditate in the mind, because the heart is the seat of the soul. But it is difficult for some people to meditate in the heart because they are not used to doing it.</p>
<p>In the ordinary human life, the mind is of paramount importance. Without it we would not be able to function properly. But if you enter into the spiritual life, you will see that what the mind has mostly given you is information, and not illumination. The mind that you feed with books, the mind that you utilise to converse with people, the mind that you require in order to exist on earth cannot take you even an inch closer to God-realisation. As long as you have tremendous faith in your mind — the mind that complicates and confuses everything — you will be doomed to disappointment. Ordinary people think that complication is wisdom. But spiritual people know that complication is dangerous. God is very simple, Light is very simple. It is in our simplicity and sincerity, not in complexity, that the real Truth abides. Complexity cannot give us anything. Complexity itself is destruction. Once you are totally dissatisfied with the limited capacity of the mind, it will be possible for you to concentrate on the heart.</p>
<p>Real meditation is not information; it is identification. The mind tries to create oneness by grabbing and capturing you and this may easily make you revolt. But the heart creates oneness through identification. The mind tries to possess. The heart just expands and, while expanding, it embraces. With the mind you only divide yourself. The mind may try to do something and immediately the body or the vital may try to prevent it. But if the heart wants to do something, no matter how difficult, it will be done. If the mind gets no satisfaction when it tries something, it just says that there is no reality there and gives up. But when the heart does not get satisfaction, it feels that it has not done the thing properly. So it tries again, and continues trying until satisfaction dawns at last.</p>
<p>Let us not be satisfied with the things that we get very easily. Let us cry for something which is more difficult to get, but which is infinite and everlasting. If you get something from the mind, tomorrow doubt may come and tell you that it is not real. But once you get something from the heart you will never he able to doubt it or forget it. An experience on the psychic plane can never be erased from the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is universal Consciousness? How does one recognise it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is universal Consciousness? How does one recognise it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Universal Consciousness is one of the major realisations of the seeker, but we cannot say that the realisation of the universal Consciousness is the highest realisation. The realisation of the transcendental Consciousness is higher than the realisation of the universal Consciousness.</p>
<p>The term 'universal Consciousness' means that the aspirant is fully conscious of his inner divine existence. This experience makes him feel that he is of the One, and at the same time he is for the many, for all: One for all and all for One. When his awakened consciousness makes him feel the reality of "One for all and all for One," then it is the universal Consciousness.</p>
<p>One recognises the universal Consciousness only when he feels that his individual existence cannot be separated from the universal existence. He is like a drop of the ocean. If the drop is taken away from the ocean, then the ocean is incomplete, and naturally the drop is also incomplete.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At times the mind wants to indulge in certain worldly and emotional thoughts during meditation. But the aspirant has to be very careful and not permit the mind to do so. During meditation everything is intense and if the aspirant indulges in evil thoughts, the effects become more serious and more dangerous. The aspirant grows weaker the moment the mind becomes a prey to self-indulgent thoughts.</p>
<p>It is the very nature of our lower mind to deceive us. But our tears and the mounting flame in our heart will always come to our rescue.</p>
<p>When you discover that for five or ten minutes your mind has been filled with undivine and ordinary thoughts, you have to feel that you have really missed an opportunity, that you have really lost something precious. You will then feel that you want to prevent this from happening again, and the next time you will be very careful and attentive.</p>
