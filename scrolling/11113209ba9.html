<p>At one point, a man was running alongside Nishtha. I am sure she was desperately trying to look at me, but she didn't go either one step ahead or one step behind this man. So I couldn't see her.</p>

<p>This morning I was running along 150th Street and a bus that was passing by kept honking at me. Finally, I turned to see what all the commotion was about. The bus driver, a very nice black man, was waving at me. He had been making all that noise just to get my attention. This was the same bus driver who had asked me once why I wasn't running any more.</p>

<p>When I was finishing the three-mile race in Seattle, a man came up to me and said very imperiously, "I want your blessings. I am going to Pakistan." Then he told me the name of the place. It is in West Pakistan, near the Chinese border. Since he will be leaving in a few weeks, he wanted my blessing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, around one o'clock in the morning, I took six or seven boys with me while I went out for a run. They were standing along 150th Street, helping me. They were so calm and quiet, but somebody called up the police and made complaints against us. They said some suspicious characters were outside.</p>
<p>A policeman came to see what we were doing. He was so sympathetic. He knew us well. He asked me whether I had run the Long Island Marathon. He said that if the rest of the people in the neighbourhood would be my disciples, then he would have no problems.</p>

<p>While I was running during my visit to Seattle somebody in a car shouted, "Sir, Sir." I thought he was going to ask me directions, so I said, "I don't know the way." inwardly I said to myself, "I know the inner way, but the inner way will not solve your problem."</p>
<p>Then the man stopped the car and said again, "Sir." He looked like a nice man, so I went up to the car.</p>
<p>He said, "You looked so beautiful and you meditated so beautifully at the concert you gave here. How I wish I could meditate like you." He was appreciating me for my meditation.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Would you like to have a book on meditation? Please give me your address."</p>
<p>While he was writing down his name and address, he said, "Believe me, I am one of your true lovers." Then, as he was giving me the piece of paper, he grabbed my right hand through the window and kissed it. He wouldn't let go.</p>
<p>I gave the Seattle disciples the address to send the man a copy of my meditation book. They said they know the man well. He belongs to the Theosophical Society and he sent me his greetings and love through one of the Seattle disciples when he came to New York.</p>

<p>When I was warming up before the three-mile race in Seattle, somebody came up to me and stood right in front of me. He looked at me and said, "Can't you recognise me?"</p>
<p>Do I know these runners? Then I remembered him. He had lost much weight. I said, "Frank."</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, yes, it is Frank Bozanich."</p>
<p>I said, "I saw you when you came to our place with Don Ritchie."</p>
<p>He was talking and talking about the different runners. He spoke about so many runners, but what do I know about runners? He was telling me that today he was going to run in our three mile race, the next day he was going to run forty miles and the next day one hundred miles. I thought he would win a prize in our race, but he didn't get any place.</p>
<p>At the end of the race, Frank was waiting for me, and again he started talking. I went and sat in my chair. He followed me. Our conversation never ended.Then, when I was about to give the prizes, whom do I see? Somebody has to come and shake hands with me. That was the final time. He said he had to leave.</p>

<p>It is no joke to run a seven-minute pace. Today, in the three-mile race in Greenport, Long Island, by the time the race started at ten o'clock, it was so hot. After the first six hundred metres, I was feeling very hot. My head was so hot, I couldn't breathe and I was dying of thirst. Still, in my first mile, I did my fastest time since I have been in America: a 6:35 pace.</p>

<p>After the three-mile race today in Greenport, Long Island, an old man of sixty came up to me. He was worried because I had finished before him. He thought I would take first place in his category — sixty and over. This man did stand first.</p>

<p>One girl was with me all the time during the three-mile race. I was breathing so heavily, but from her there was no noise at all. She was the silent Brahmin. I felt miserable that I was disturbing her consciousness. She was the better runner, so she should have gone ahead, but she stayed right by my side.</p>
<p>Then, when we were 800 metres from the finish, she disappeared. But I could not go any faster.</p>

<p>There were two children running the three mile race — a brother and sister about seven or eight years old. All of a sudden, the sister got a leg cramp and couldn't even walk. The brother waited for her. I said, "Such a wonderful brother! He is waiting for his sister."</p>

<p>In the race, the young children were the problem-makers. They had indomitable energy. As soon as I saw a child, I would say to myself, "I am surrendering." When children run, they don't know how to become tired. They smile, and their strides are so wonderful. They go this side and that side, running back and forth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The San Francisco meeting</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The San Francisco meeting" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Just before the Sri Chinmoy Marathon in San Francisco, I was warming up. A former disciple of mine was near me, but I could not recognise him. He was taking Chinese exercises. Finally, one of my San Francisco disciples told me, "This is Devashish." I had been pretty sure, but then I went closer and I did recognise him.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Do you recognise me?"</p>
<p>Immediately he blessed me, placing both his hands on my feet. His eyes were flickering and moving around. I blessed him and told him that his soul had come to me so many times. He was smiling and full of devotion, but his eyes defeated my eyes like anything in flickering. Because his present wife, or girl-friend, was blessing me inwardly — or rather, cursing me inwardly — I left.</p>
<p>At about two and one-half miles into the marathon, there was a turn, and as I was entering the turn, I saw him on his way back. He saw me from about 500 metres away and he raised both arms. I signalled him when we passed each other.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he came up to me and showed me how many exercises he knew. Each time he did a punching motion, it reminded me of his monkey incarnation.</p>
