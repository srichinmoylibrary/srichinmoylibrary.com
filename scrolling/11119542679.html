<p>One fellow was running the marathon in sandals. Vidura gave him his running shoes and they fit him.</p>
<p>In the last two miles Virendra ran so fast that he passed four or five runners.</p>
<p>He came in second.</p>
<p>The two brothers, Aviram and Pravaha, are such jokers. At thirteen miles I saw them stop and go into the hotel. The tall one said, "Guru, after thirteen miles we realised we were not wearing your T-shirt, so we went into the hotel."</p>
<p>Then the little one said, "Guru, we got a little tired, so we stopped!"</p>

<p>I was running by my 600-metre mark, and Baoul and Kailash were 200 metres behind me in a car. Then I saw Neeta in a car, so I smiled and waved.</p>
<p>When I mentioned it to Nishtha, she told me that Neeta doesn't drive; she doesn't even have a car. Then I began doubting myself. Am I so blind? Later I found out that Neeta does have a car, and it was Neeta I saw.</p>

<p>Yesterday I ran John's one-mile course in Flushing Meadow Park. Kailash took my timing. I have made tremendous progress â€” from 13:40 to 11:40! If I can make progress, all of you can make progress.</p>
<p>If you lose seven to ten pounds, you will not die. But the result is something else. If you lose ten pounds, even three pounds, you simply fly when you run. You don't need to be a bird to fly.</p>
<p>So, overweight people, lose ten pounds!</p>

<p>In the Inspiration Marathon last year, Chris' brother, Carlos, was behind me. I will never forget how all of a sudden I heard him scream, "Guru!"</p>
<p>At that time he stood fourth.</p>
<p>I will also never forget what happened four or five years ago on the course in Breezy Point. There he stood first in our four-mile race. Like a horse he was galloping! He is so short, but his stride was so long. Such a big stride! He was returning, and I had not yet gone half the way.</p>

<p>During the 20-mile race in Central Park today, one old man was looking at me and telling another old man, "He is the director of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team!" Then two ladies â€” not disciples â€” started calling me, "Guru, Guru!"</p>

<p>During the five-mile race, I was running behind Durga. She saw me and went to the other side, but I was so tired that I stayed behind her. Then we came to a hill. I said, "Where is she? Where is she?"</p>
<p>I used to do hill work every day, and while I was running I was thinking of my hill work. I was running and she was running too, but because I was thinking of my hill work I went ahead of her. Only by thinking of it was I able to go ahead of her, or perhaps she deliberately showed me compassion.</p>

<p>An old lady said, "Sri, are you not walking? Are you not walking?" She saw how tired I was â€” that I was dying â€” so she was begging me to walk. She was very kind to me.</p>

<p>In this five-mile race I ran the whole distance. It was difficult. After 4 miles I was calling Databir, but he did not come. So I waited.</p>
<p>When he came, he took my yellow jacket. Once you start running, after 10 or 15 minutes, you want to take off everything. My upper body was burning, burning. Some people wore shorts, but I didn't.</p>
<p>When Databir took my jacket, I was greatly relieved. At least 10 or 15 seconds definitely I lost, but my last mile was my best mile.</p>
