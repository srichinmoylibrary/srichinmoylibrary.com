<p>When the battle of Kurukshetra was over, countless people were killed. Sri Krishna's family, relatives and dear ones were all killed in the great, unthinkable turmoil and confusion. Even Sri Krishna himself left the body.</p>
<p>When it was Balarama's time, he sat down under a tree and went to sleep. Soon his soul, in the form of the cosmic serpent, Shesha, whose incarnation he was, came out from his mouth and laughed at Balarama's lifeless body. He was found on a rock, under a tree.</p>
<p>Poor Arjuna, his dear Balarama and his dearer than the dearest Krishna were no more. Arjuna had to do the final obsequies for these two and also for many, many more. His heart broke, but alas, this is life. Happiness is followed by sorrow. This is an undeniable fact.</p>

<p>Bhrigu was a supreme sage who was found in many Indian legends and Hindu mythology. Once a terrible quarrel arose between Shiva and Daksha, Shiva's father-in-law. Bhrigu took Daksha's side and officiated at Daksha's sacrifice. Shiva became terribly angry with Bhrigu and said, "How dare you take Daksha's side!"</p>
<p>Bhrigu said, "I can take whichever side I want to. It is my business, not yours."</p>
<p>Shiva pulled Bhrigu's beard off, and poor Bhrigu suffered a lot from the pain.</p>
<p>Bhrigu was married to one of Daksha's daughters, Khyati. She was extremely devoted to her husband and pleased him in every way. Bhrigu was extremely proud of her.</p>
<p>She was extremely angry with Shiva for pulling off Bhrigu's beard and cursed him. The curse was that Shiva would become ugly. But Lord Shiva is above humanity's curse. If he had wanted to be cursed, he could have easily suffered from the curse. But Shiva's beauty remained unparalleled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The greatest of the deities</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The greatest of the deities" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once the sages wanted to know who among the great deities — Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — was the greatest. They debated and debated. Finally they appointed Bhrigu to settle the matter. Bhrigu visited Shiva's place, but he was not allowed to enter because Shiva and his consort were having a serious discussion. Bhrigu got mad and said, "Shiva, you're always like this. Your very nature is to be disrespectful. You do not honour anybody. You are careless and callous. I curse you. No good person will ever love you or adore you, not to speak of worship you. You are so bad."</p>
<p>Then Bhrigu went to visit Brahma. Brahma was listening to the discourses of the great intellectuals. The intellectuals were appreciating and admiring Brahma's capacities. He was so engulfed in his own importance that he paid no attention to Bhrigu's presence. Bhrigu became furious and said, "Brahma, I never knew that you were so undivine. You don't care for guests. A guest is nothing short of God Himself. I curse you! Now nobody desiring salvation will come to you. You are so undivine. Only bad people, intellectual people, clever people, will come to you. Sincere seekers will not come to you."</p>
<p>Then Bhrigu went to Vishnu. Vishnu was fast asleep. He heard the sound of Bhrigu's arrival, but did not pay any attention. He continued to enjoy his sleep. Bhrigu said to himself, "Here is the worst!" and he kicked Vishnu very hard. Vishnu did not become annoyed at all. In fact, he apologized at once for not being ready to receive the sage. He said, "O sage, I am sorry, I am sorry. Forgive me. I am sure you are deeply hurt because you have kicked me. I feel sorry, extremely sorry, sincerely sorry. Please forgive me. I hope that you are not injured. I am so proud that a holy man has kicked me. You are really a holy man and I deserved your kick."</p>
<p>Bhrigu said, "You are truly virtuous and humble. Because of your humility, not only will all human beings worship you, but the cosmic gods will also worship you. You are great, greater, greatest. Undoubtedly, you are greater than Shiva and Brahma."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Bhrigu&#039;s method of casting horoscopes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Bhrigu&#039;s method of casting horoscopes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Bhrigu was better than anyone else in astrology. He was greatly versed in the mysterious workings of human destiny. He compiled astrological charts giving the horoscope of every person who was born or yet to be born. His charts were infallible. It was he who introduced the use of fire.</p>
<p>There was a young boy in India who was amused to hear of all the astrological capacities of Bhrigu. He almost doubted Bhrigu's capacities. His elder brother was extremely fond of astrology and was also well versed in it.</p>
<p>He said, "You don't believe Bhrigu. You think that his method of casting horoscopes is all hallucination. But you are wrong, my dear brother. Let me cast your horoscope according to Bhrigu."</p>
<p>A few days later the young boy read his horoscope. There it was written that at the age of eleven he would go to a spiritual ashram to stay permanently under the guidance of a very, very great spiritual master. Then, after twenty years, he would start offering his own light to the world.</p>
<p>At that time, the young boy was in Bengal. When the hour came, the boy was taken by the elder members of his family to a great spiritual institute in south India, and there he stayed for twenty years. Then he became a spiritual Master and offered his own light to the world. So Bhrigu's way of casting horoscopes was infallible.</p>
<p>Another incident which the young boy never forgot was Bhrigu's explanation of why his maternal uncle had no children. According to Bhrigu's book, his maternal uncle's horoscope said that in his previous incarnation he was a great hunter. While hunting one day, he killed a pregnant deer. The pregnant deer cursed him saying, "I would not have cared if you had killed me alone, but I am pregnant and you have killed the child inside me. Therefore, I am cursing you. In your next incarnation you will not have one child. You will see the pain of not having a child in your next incarnation."</p>
<p>Alas, the curse fell absolutely true, and the boy's maternal uncle remained childless.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Vishma&#039;s birth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Vishma&#039;s birth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a great king named Shantanu. His father's name was Pratip and his mother's name was Sunanda. Shantanu's elder brother was Devapi. Devapi became a sannyasi and did not care for earthly name and fame. He did not care for anything. He left the palace and Shantanu had to ascend the throne when King Pratip, his father, died.</p>
<p>Shantanu had a special capacity which nobody else had. When he touched a human being, no matter how old the person was, by his mere touch he could transform that person into a strong and vigorous youth. He did it many times and was always successful.</p>
<p>Shantanu was very beautiful and also pious, truthful, hardworking and dynamic. He was very fond of hunting and was a great hunter. He especially loved hunting deer.</p>
<p>One day, he saw at the bank of the Ganges a most beautiful woman. He became enamoured of her beauty and ran to her saying, "Please tell me who you are. In fact, you don't have to tell me who you are. Just marry me. I wish to marry you. I am the King. I will give you everything you want just for the asking."</p>
<p>The beautiful girl, Gangadevi, said, "Are you sure you will be able to fulfil me in every way?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can and I shall. Your beauty has captured my heart."</p>
<p>"All right then, I will marry you on one condition."</p>
<p>"Any condition I shall fulfil."</p>
<p>"No matter what I do, you will not stand in my way. No matter what I say, you will not stand in my way."</p>
<p>"Never, never! I shall not stand in your way. Just be my wife. I will be at your beck and call. Indeed, you are beauty incarnate."</p>
<p>They were married and both King and Queen were happy. Alas, when they had their first child, the mother threw the child into the Ganges. They had seven children, and as soon as each child was born she threw the infant into the Ganges.</p>
<p>The King knew that if he scolded her or stood in her way, she would leave him because that was the condition she made. His love for her was boundless, and for fear of losing her, he remained silent.</p>
<p>But when the eighth child was born, he was sad, disturbed and mad. He said, "How can you do this? Are you not a human being? You are the child's mother. How can a mother do this? The mother is supposed to be flooded with love and compassion for her children. You are so cruel, so undivine. How can I keep you as my wife?"</p>
<p>The wife smiled and smiled, "So! You have failed to keep your promise. I can't stay with you anymore. I am going and I am taking my son with me. When this child grows into a youth, I shall bring him back to you — I promise you. Now, I have to take care of him, because it is the mother only who can take care of a small baby. But when he grows up, I shall bring him to you."</p>
<p>She did keep her promise. The name of that eighth child was Vishma, the unparalleled hero of the Mahabharata.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Rich people, open up your eyes and hearts</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Rich people, open up your eyes and hearts" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Four or five young boys belonged to a special club. Each day they went from door to door to collect material objects and money from people. They were taking up this collection so they could do things that would inspire the villagers to lead a better life and fight against the British Government. They put everything in a big bag and, at the end of the day, they brought the bag to their leader.</p>
<p>One day, a young lame boy came and joined them. At first they didn't want to have a lame boy with them. They were singing songs to Krishna, saying, "O Krishna, you took the Pandavas' side against the Kauravas and the Pandavas won. The British people are the Kauravas. Please take our side. With your help only will we be able to conquer the British rule." They were singing this while walking along the street. The poor lame boy also joined them. Since he was singing so soulfully, they allowed him to follow them.</p>
<p>By the end of the day they had gone to many places. They were about to give the bag to the leader without looking inside to see what they had got. The young lame boy said, "I wish to see how much you have got."</p>
<p>All the boys mocked at him, "You are such a greedy fellow. We never look to see how much we got. We just give the bag to the leader."</p>
<p>The leader said, "Since the fellow is asking and he is lame, let us show him."</p>
<p>Still the boys were laughing at him: "This is his sincere love for his country!"</p>
<p>While they were emptying the bag, the lame boy emptied his small bag and said, "Now I don't have to see. I have seen everything."</p>
<p>The boys saw that the lame boy had given what he had got from begging door to door for two or three days.</p>
<p>The leader said, "Look, he gave everything that he had and is. We go door to door, but sometimes people won't give us anything. They are suffering so much from British rule, but even rich people give us next to nothing. If all India had a heart like this beggar, by today India would have been free."</p>
<p>The leader ran and grabbed the lame boy and embraced him. "You have opened our eyes."</p>
<p>The lame boy said, "Your heart, your eyes, everything are open. It is we who have to go from door to door now and open up the eyes and hearts of rich people."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tagore and Gandhi: both are right</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tagore and Gandhi: both are right" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Tagore and Gandhi are two immortals. They were extremely good friends and they had tremendous appreciation and admiration for each other. Tagore used to call Gandhi "Mahatma," which means great soul, and Gandhi used to call Tagore "Gurudev" — spiritual teacher, Master of inner wisdom and light.</p>
<p>Once, in front of many people, they were having a simple discussion. Unfortunately, the discussion became very heated. Some people took Tagore's side, while others took Gandhi's side. A great artist named Nandalal Bose happened to be there, so people asked him which side he was on.</p>
<p>"We are taking sides," they said, "so you must take one side."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the artist replied. "Please do not ask me to take sides."</p>
<p>Still, everyone wanted to hear his opinion. "You must be in agreement with either Gandhi or Tagore. We are curious to know what you are thinking," they said.</p>
<p>Again Nandalal Bose said, "I can't take any side."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" they asked him. "Don't you have a mind of your own?" Finally Nandalal Bose said, "I am an artist. If you ask me which colour I like most, I have to say that I feel that all colours are good; to me they are all excellent. Here, I have great admiration for these two, so for me both of them are right. I won't take either side. Both Tagore and Gandhi are right."</p>
