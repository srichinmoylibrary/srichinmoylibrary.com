<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite peaceful. There is only one thing that we need here on earth and that is peace. Everything else is meaningless and useless. We can get name, fame, prosperity and everything on the outer plane. But if we do not find peace in the inmost recesses of our heart, then we will never be satisfied. Only peace can give us satisfaction. To find this peace we have to dive deep within and pray and meditate. I feel that when people look at my drawings and find peace, this helps to bring forward their own soul's qualities and thus increase their own wisdom and joy. When they look at these birds and see them flying in the inner freedom-sky, this increases their own heart's joy.</p>

Is this how most of these were done, just sitting?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, just sitting. Usually when I draw, I try to be in a contemplative mood — in a prayerful, soulful consciousness — and I do not talk. Usually I draw early in the morning when I am all by myself, or when I am inside the car. But sometimes I also draw when people are moving around and I am in the middle of the hustle and bustle of life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Interviewer: Do you have a bird in mind when you draw?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Interviewer: Do you have a bird in mind when you draw?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have nothing in mind. I try to keep my mind as empty, vacant and tranquil as possible. The outer mind is like the surface of the sea. On the surface, the sea is full of waves and surges; it is all restlessness. But when we dive deep below, the same sea is all peace, calmness and quiet. It is there that we find the source of creativity.</p>
<p>I do not use the mind when I draw because the process of thinking binds us. When I use the mind, I become bound and limited. As soon as we think of something, we are binding ourselves. The mind is binding us precisely because it has not yet learned the art of self-giving, which is all expansion. It is the inner heart, the aspiring heart, that has learned the art of self-giving. As soon as we enter into anybody's heart, even if that particular person is our so-called enemy, we will immediately feel that he is also trying to become a better person. But when we enter into somebody's mind, O God, we see that he is trying to destroy us. And if we enter into our own mind, we see that we also have the same destructive thoughts. That is why our minds are always clashing. I want to lord it over you; you want to lord it over me. When we live in the mind, we only want to exercise our supremacy. But when we are inside our hearts, we only love one another; and at that time the question of supremacy does not arise at all. We can solve our problems by always trying to remain inside our heart and feel our oneness with one another.</p>
<p>These birds reflect the heart's oneness. They represent unity in multiplicity. Each bird is different, but when you look at them, you feel unity. A tree has so many leaves and flowers, but they are all part of the same oneness-tree. Here there are 70,000 birds, but as soon as we think of the bird-consciousness, it becomes one bird. The bird-consciousness represents the consciousness of our soul's inner freedom.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Will you continue to add to this number?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I have been drawing more birds every day. Today I have completed 76,000. It is my wish on the 19th of November to exhibit 100,000 birds in Ottawa. About 19 years ago I entered into the art-world in a hotel room in Ottawa. There I did my first drawing in the West. I have students in Canada and every year they observe the anniversary of that first drawing which was a rose. This November it is our plan to have a huge gallery that will house 100,000 bird drawings. I do hope that by the end of October I will be able to complete them.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Will you also exhibit your acrylic paintings?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only a few selected paintings will be on display.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not know what is going to happen unless and until my Inner Pilot tells me what He wants me to do. On my own I do not know because He is the Doer in me. According to the capacity of my receptivity, through my prayer and meditation, I try to receive His Messages. He knows everything infinitely, infinitely better than I do, and at His choice Hour He will tell me to do this or to do that. I know that when the time comes — we call it God's Hour — it is He who will direct me.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Did you call Him your Inner Father?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I call him my Father or my Inner Pilot, the Pilot of my life-boat. I take life as a boat and I feel that He is steering it towards the supreme destination — the Golden Shore. He is the Supreme Pilot and He is steering our life-boats to the Golden Shore.</p>

 <p>
SCA 73-77. Interview by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. On 6 January 1994 Sri Chinmoy was interviewed live by telephone on the radio programme <em>As it Happens</em>, for broadcast over CBC Canada. This is a transcript of that interview.</p>
<h2>Interviewer: Sri Chinmoy is not your ordinary, everyday Guru. He and his disciples are known for completing tasks of amazing magnitude. Record-setting feats of endurance are among the ways Sri Chinmoy and his followers pursue inner calm. The latest feat was just finished: one million sketches, and every one a bird — a million birds of peace. Sri Chinmoy himself has completed the sketches to celebrate the birthday today of Raisa Gorbachev. We have reached international artist and peace ambassador, Sri Chinmoy, in Suva, Fiji. Sri Chinmoy, you must be very pleased that you successfully drew one million birds. You must be glad that it is over.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I am extremely glad that it is all over. Each bird reminds me of freedom, and I feel that freedom lives in peace and nowhere else.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two years ago, while I was in Malta, all of a sudden I was inspired to draw birds. Since then I have been drawing birds. I used to get and even now I still get tremendous joy each time I draw a bird. Each time I feel a kind of inner freedom.</p>
<p>I wish to tell you that Canada has a very special place in my art-life. About 19 years ago I started my art-life in the West by doing some paintings and drawings at the Sheraton Hotel in Ottawa. Also, last year 100,000 bird drawings of mine were exhibited in Ottawa. Our philosophy is the philosophy of progress, so from 100,000 I have come up to one million.</p>

<p><em>Interviewer:</em> What is your next project? Do you have anything else in mind now?</p>
