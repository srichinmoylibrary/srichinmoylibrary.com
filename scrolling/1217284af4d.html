<p>First of all, one has to know and feel where the soul abides, its location in the body. In order to know and feel the soul, one has to aspire. During one's ardent aspiration, one's spiritual journey, one can actually discover whether the soul is happy or not. He will feel that his soul is happy only when he sees and feels joy within and without, and also when he does not find fault with God's creation and God's divine dispensation.</p>

<p>No. The real soul, which is a portion of the Cosmic Self, is all Delight. Since it cannot be unhappy in the human sense of the term, it does not cry. It is the unsatisfied and demanding vital, which we often take for the soul, that suffers unhappiness and cries pitifully.</p>

<p>Yes. There are two sets of instructions within the person. Goodness and compassion come from the very depth of one's being, whereas "me" and "mine" come from the surface. "Me" and "mine" cannot come from the very depths.</p>

<p>Yes. The soul can be represented in dreams by an old woman or by a young baby. In order to give a particular experience to the outer being, the soul can assume any form in dreams. The gradual divine maturity of the soul can be compared to the gradual growth of a seed into a tree.</p>

<p>The soul itself is neither male nor female. But when the soul at the start of its human journey takes a female body, then in all its future incarnations it will take a female body. If it first takes a male body, then in all its incarnations it will take a male body. It is nearly impossible to change the sex. In the whole history of mankind there have been a few exceptions here and there, but very rarely.</p>

<p>Yes. It is the soul that makes the decision in selecting a body, but with the direct approval of the Supreme or the Self. The choice is made to give the soul the opportunity to manifest more and more of its inner divinity in each incarnation and to fulfil the Will of the Divine here on earth.</p>

<p>Yes. Each human being has an individual soul. This soul has to surrender to the Self — the Self which, in Indian terms, is called <em>Paramatman</em>, and is unmanifest. This Self does not take human incarnation or enter into creation, whereas the soul takes a human body and accepts limitation, imperfection and ignorance. This individual soul, which takes a human body, is not all-pervading, omniscient or omnipotent. The Self is. The soul, in its upward evolution, can some day merge into the Self and become as powerful as the Self.</p>

<p>If you say "experience" rather than "instruction", the question would be more accurate. Only God, or the Cosmic Self, can instruct the soul.</p>
<p>The soul is uncovering what it has always known. But at the same time, it is growing and enriching itself by taking into itself the divine essence of its earthly experiences. Meanwhile, the physical consciousness is becoming more and more conscious of the soul's unlimited divine capacity. In essence, the soul, being one with God, is uncovering what it has always known. But in the process of evolution, its <em>becoming</em> and <em>knowing, knowing</em> and <em>becoming</em> move together and are complementary processes in the lap of the Supreme Truth.</p>

If so, how does this differ from our superficial need to have the company of others, regardless of whether we like them or not, simply because we want someone to talk to?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The soul experiences loneliness only when the body, vital, mind and heart, which are supposed to co-operate with the soul in fulfilling its divine mission on earth, do not co-operate. At that time it experiences loneliness. But it does not act like a human being. It does not waste its time, like a human being who feels that if he just talks to others, his sense of loneliness will disappear. The soul, in its loneliness, aspires most intensely to bring down Peace, Light and Power from above into the physical, the vital and the mental so that the total being can co-operate with the soul to fulfil the Divine. When Peace, Light and Power descend this way, the person becomes conscious of his inner life and true happiness. With Peace, Light and Power a higher consciousness descends. With this higher consciousness, the person will naturally respond to the soul's need.</p>

<p>The soul does not make demands as such. It is not like a mother making demands of her child at every moment, saying, "I'm telling you such and such for your own good." What the soul does is send a divine inspiration. This inspiration can at times be so vivid and spontaneous that the person may feel it to be almost an inner imposition made by his inner self on his outer personality. But the soul does not demand. On the contrary, it sympathises with human failings and imperfections and tries to identify itself with these failings. And then, with its inner Light, it tries to help the person to change his ways.</p>

<p>We now know that the soul does not make any demands. When the ego makes a demand, it is all self-centred — "I", "me", "mine." The ego wants to possess and be possessed. By feeding the outer personality, the ego wants to fulfil itself. But this is simply impossible, as there is no end to its cravings. When the soul wants to have something, it is not for its own personal benefit but for the fulfilment of the Divine. The ego eventually meets with frustration, whereas the soul, by fulfilling the Divine Will, realises its own absolute fulfilment.</p>

<p>Each thing and each place has a soul. Like all other cities, the city of New York has a soul. The Supreme has graciously shown me the soul of New York City a number of times. The difference between the souls of things and the souls of humans is a matter of their degree of evolution, the degree to which they manifest their divine potentialities. It is through the process of reincarnation that the soul gradually manifests its hidden powers within, and eventually reaches its absolute fulfilment.</p>

<p>Certainly. The earth represents the Mother aspect of the Divine. It is on earth that Matter and Spirit will find their absolute fulfilment through their reciprocal help and complete union. Matter will see through the eye of the Spirit's vision. Spirit will flower by awakening and energising Matter to become a perfect basis of physical immortality and human transformation on earth.

<p>Certainly. The gross can and must help the subtle. The body is gross, but in its sound and perfect condition, it helps the mind and the subtle existence considerably. One cannot, of course, make the soul stronger merely by taking vigorous physical exercises or by eating judiciously. But if the body, that is, the physical consciousness, aspires to grow in the Light of the soul and tries to fulfil the Divine in the physical itself, then the progress of the soul becomes easier, faster and more fulfilling.</p>
