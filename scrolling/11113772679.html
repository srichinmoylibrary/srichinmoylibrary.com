<p>In my latest racing adventure in Prospect Park — a two-mile race — I got the first prize because there was no competition in the Masters' category. There was a group of people who were excellent runners ahead of me. But not even one girl was ahead of me. Behind me were other runners.</p>
<p>Danny knows how to flatter me, and I am full of receptivity for his flattery. Recently, he videotaped a race for half an hour, but he taped only three seconds of my running. So I scolded him.</p>
<p>This time, he wanted to show more of me running, and less of others. So, at the finish line, he video-taped all the runners ahead of me. But, according to Danny, behind me nobody existed! Danny showed that I was the last runner!</p>

<p>I was running in the afternoon at a seven and a half or eight-minute pace. An old man with a pronounced moustache was watching me. He said, "Don't run so fast! You will get tired."</p>

<p>On one street, three or four boys and two or three girls are real monkeys. Each time they see me running, they stand up. They don't cheer me; they boo: "Boo, Guru!" That kind of thing they do! They are bad people, bad people. I pray to God, when I come back, that I don't see them, and God listens to my prayer. When I come back, I don't see them.</p>

<p>When I was running a few months ago, three or four girls who were standing near the street started barking. Human beings started barking at me! Very bad! There are so many nice people in this area, but God's creation is so vast. Always He has to have a mixture of good and bad. Four or five girls and boys are so unkind to me. Each time they see me they have to make fun of me. Again, most of the others are very nice.</p>

<p>This morning I was running on the left side of the street. On the right side a car passed me. It was in the other lane, but just because I heard it coming, I stopped. A stout black man was driving. He gave me a smile and said, "You are right. Always you should stop and watch."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A flat two-mile course</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A flat two-mile course" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I have been asking the boys to find me a two mile course to run — flat, without sidewalks and side streets and no more than ten minutes away by car. Nobody has been successful; perhaps nobody ever will be successful. Vinaya last week told me he had found place. I believed him, and he took me there. God! It was a useless road! He wasted my time, but I forgave him.</p>
<p>Then, three days ago, he said he had found Heaven on earth. Those were his words. I said, "To find Heaven on earth is really something!"</p>
<p>So I went to see his Heaven. It was Heaven, according to Vinaya — our old course at my seven mile mark. His course was full of small pebbles and stones, and it was not even clean. It was very bad, very bad! The other day Lorne look me to a place that he said was extremely beautiful. He said that Kanan was the witness, that Kanan had taken him there. So I went to see the place. O God! It was almost like a highway, with a tiny path for cyclists on the side. Thousands of cars were going by very fast. So how could I run? That was Lorne's place. Like that, many people tempt me to go and see their discoveries, but their discoveries always frustrate me.</p>

<p>This morning I was worshipping Anupadi's feet as I was running behind her. She was running with such short strides that I was thanking the Supreme that there is at least one girl disciple who has shorter strides than I do. That is why I was worshipping her feet.</p>

<p>About a week ago I was running up and down 150th Street. A gentleman was watching me. Two or three times he saw me run up the big hill. Then he said, "Sri Chinmoy, you are making me tired. Stop, stop!" He was only watching me, and he said I was making him tired.</p>

<p>At four o'clock this morning I ran four and a half miles. As usual, my pace was 8:40. Two girls were helping the road crew and holding markers at every quarter-mile. Each time they held up the sign, I was pretending that the numbers indicated a full mile, not just a quarter-mile. They put up the number one marker, and I pretended I had run one mile. But when it was sixteen, I had only run four miles — not sixteen. Then I had to stop pretending.</p>

<p>Yesterday Pahar and Lorne were running side by side, right in front of me. I was just two steps behind. A young boy rode his bike so fast right in between them. Pahar and Lorne were furious — there was very little space between them, and I was just behind them. This is how bad some young boys are!</p>

<p>The other day, I saw Anupadi running. She was dressed in all her winter clothes, trying to lose weight to pass the weigh-in. Had she been a better runner, I would have invited her to run with my road crew and me. But we were planning to run quite fast. If I had been running by myself, with just one driver, she could have trained with us.</p>

<p>Monday, when I was visiting my students' offices in UNICEF, I had a soulful conversation with Chandika's boss. Then, this morning, before I went out running for the second time — around six o'clock — I meditated on him. For nice people, quite often I do something special in the inner world, even if they are not my disciples. Yesterday her boss showed gratitude and today, also, his soul came to me.</p>
<p>After meditating on him, while running I was getting a very good response from his soul; it was all gratitude. His soul is a combination of dynamism and softness. Usually, dynamic people do not have any soft qualities; but his main attributes are his dynamism and softness. He is a very luminous soul.</p>

<p>Then two teachers turned around and saw me. They stood aside and showed me much respect.</p>
