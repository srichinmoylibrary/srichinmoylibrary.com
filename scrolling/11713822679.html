<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are desperately trying to feel God's Presence in your life, you have to feel how much sincerity is involved, how much purity of mind is involved. If purity of mind is involved when you are desperately trying to achieve something or stop doing something, then the patience-seed will automatically be planted inside you.</p>
<p>Your heart's sincerity and your mind's purity will give you the amount of patience that you need. When you desperately need something, and if patience is needed, automatically your sincerity and purity will tell you whether it will take ten days or twenty days or two months. At that time, you do not have to use the word 'patience'. If sincerity is involved, if purity is involved, then you do not have to worry, even if it takes two years to conquer your problem.</p>

If God is inside everyone, why are we not seeing that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are lucky. You are trying so hard to see God. God has put in front of you two fruits. The colour of the fruits is the same. God says, "Now you pray and meditate. If you pray and meditate, you will take the right fruit." But many people are not ready to pray and meditate. They are so greedy that immediately they grab one fruit, and the one that they have taken is called ignorance. The outer skin of both fruits looks so beautiful. We feel that both of them will be equally delicious. God has told us to pray to Him to grant us the wisdom to choose the right one, but we have no patience. We say, "No, no. I am sure both of them are equally good." We choose one, only to discover that it is all ignorance. Then we suffer. When we take that fruit, we go farther and farther away from God. But if we had prayed to God to choose the right one, we would have taken the one which is wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between your poise and your patience?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between your poise and your patience?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Poise is infinitely, infinitely higher, deeper and wider than patience. In my case, there is no comparison between my poise and my patience. My poise deals at every second with the universal consciousness, the transcendental consciousness. Poise is the product of the universal consciousness, the transcendental consciousness, or you can say it the other way around: from poise we enter into the universal consciousness, from poise we enter into the transcendental consciousness. Patience is like an insect and poise is like one million giants.</p>
<p>The poise of a spiritual Master deals with the universe. Spiritual Masters do not deal with one individual or two individuals, one hundred disciples or two hundred disciples. Poise has to deal with the universe, with all human beings, with the creation itself. Patience deals only with individuals we know — our dear ones or people we encounter in our daily life. But poise deals with humanity, with the universal consciousness. Poise and patience are so different. One is like a tiny drop. The other is like an ocean.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are making a mistake by bringing intuition into the picture. You have to love God more and more and more. If sincerity is involved in your love, then that love will protect you. There is no need of intuition or any other quality. If you love God with utmost sincerity, your love of God will save you. If you love God, immediately you will feel that if you do something wrong, God will shed bitter tears, ceaseless tears. So love of God will prevent you from doing many wrong things. Love of God is the answer.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. If somebody has been exercising God's Patience for a long time, and then if that person has a good heart, he will say, "God is so kind to me. He is so affectionate, so compassionate. How is it that I am torturing Him?" Many naughty children become good when they see that their mother is crying, crying, crying because they are misbehaving. They say, "How long can we torture our mother? She is all love for us, all compassion for us!" Then they turn over a new leaf. At that time the mother's patience is successful in awakening the good qualities of her children.</p>

SCA 920-925. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Brasilia, Brazil on 29 January 2000.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we best deal with the anger that comes with dynamism?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anger can easily be separated from dynamism, but only if you are in a good consciousness. If you are in a bad consciousness, an animal consciousness, then anger may appear not only in dynamism but even in the slowest movement.</p>
<p>When you are running at your top speed, is it not dynamism? At that time are you angry? No, you are running at top speed to win the race. So much dynamism is involved. Only if you are a very bad person will you curse someone else who is going ahead of you. Otherwise, you will have no time to think of others.</p>
<p>So many things you do fast, very fast, with tremendous dynamism. At that time there is no anger involved. Only if pride enters while you are running very fast does anger come into the picture. Pride can take the form of anger. Again, this pride can easily be humiliated. If somebody is going ahead of you, your pride may be smashed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes so-called unevolved things — for example, a dog — can have such noble qualities. A dog might give its life to save somebody. On the other hand, a human being that is more evolved might have such petty qualities.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes so-called unevolved things — for example, a dog — can have such noble qualities. A dog might give its life to save somebody. On the other hand, a human being that is more evolved might have such petty qualities." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has given each individual good qualities. If the individual does not use those good qualities, bad qualities loom large. Good and bad, day and night, light and shade each individual has. Because we are human beings, we are more evolved than animals. But some human beings are infinitely worse than animals. For example, if you give a dog a little food two times a day, it is satisfied. But each human being has to be supplied with new food, most delicious food every day. Otherwise that person may get angry. The poor dog is getting the same meat year after year. But a human being will try to get better food, more delicious food. Is this evolution?</p>
<p>The human mind is highly evolved, but insecurity, jealousy, pride, anger and so forth play their role. When you see a large herd of sheep, immediately you notice how gracefully, how peacefully they are staying together. If one thousand human beings are together, there will be so much screaming and fighting. They will do many unkind things. There will not be any peaceful feeling among them. In that way, the sheep are more developed.</p>
<p>You have said that in many cases, animals, specially dogs, have given their lives for their masters. Many, many more animals have given their lives and will give their lives for human beings than human beings will give for animals. Pets can be so affectionate to their master, so fond of their master, that they can give their lives.</p>
<p>Just recently I read a book about animals that have given their lives and how these animals suffered. Animals far surpass human beings when it comes to sacrifice. As human beings, sometimes we get a kind of unconscious, malicious pleasure when somebody suffers. I have come to realise that in human life there is no such thing as friendship; it is all rivalry. If your friend has achieved something, immediately your heart burns. Unless and until you have established divine friendship, rivalry always exists. If you establish divine friendship, you are safe. At that time you feel oneness. Otherwise, so-called human friendship is made of rivalry and jealousy. Outwardly if your friend achieves something, you will give a broad smile and congratulate him, but inwardly you are cursing your friend or cursing yourself because you could not do that very thing. You feel that you should have done that thing or something better. Animals do not have that kind of developed mind. True, animals can be jealous, but they are not directly entering into the world of jealousy and cursing the person who has achieved something.</p>
<p>There are many, many ways animals can help us in our evolution. Again, in the process of evolution, we are higher because we are conscious of God. The poor animals are not conscious of God. Either we pray to God or meditate on God; it is up to us. But we are conscious that there is somebody in Heaven or inside us who is watching us, while animals are not. Unconsciously they are doing many, many good and divine things.</p>
<p>Again, this does not apply to all animals. In my own case, my dog Kanu used to take my suffering. When I used to get very painful stomach upset, he would sit on my stomach and take it away. So many times when I was miserable with very serious problems, he would come and sleep right beside my head, very, very affectionately. Then my problems would be solved. How many times he took away my real physical headache and my stomach pain. When he used to sit next to me, my problems would go away. I was able to see light on how to solve the problems. This was Kanu. I have kept Kanu in the soul's world. There he is so huge. My mother takes care of him.</p>
<p>When I was young, we had a dog called Bhaga. Bhaga looked like a tiger. He was very big and very, very kind. He used to guard the whole Ghosh family — five or six houses. When we left Shakpura for good, Bhaga would not stay behind. He entered into the Kharnaphuli River and followed us. Our boat was sailing and he was swimming to catch up. Finally, we put him in the boat with us. We stayed for two or three days at our maternal uncle's place and Bhaga was so happy. Then we had to go to Pondicherry and we could not take him with us. Our relatives were so kind to this dog, but in one week Bhaga died. That was Bhaga's sacrifice for our family.</p>
<p>Something more: my physical father would have died at least three or four months before he actually departed had it not been for one of our cows. We had a number of cows, but two cows I remember, Surabhi and Nandini. They were very affectionate to each other. Surabhi was more developed than Nandini. Somehow Surabhi knew that my father would be dying soon. Surabhi did not have any disease, yet she died four or five months before my father. My father lived on earth four or five months more only because of Surabhi's sacrifice. At that time, I did not know. Later, when I came to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, because of my God-realisation, I was able to see in the inner world why Surabhi died untimely.</p>
<p>We had another dog named Teghā. Our house was in Shakpura and my aunt's place was in Dhalghat. Teghā used to carry messages from one house to the other. My sister used to write down a message. Then the servant would go with Teghā for a half mile or so. Immediately Teghā knew what he should do. The servant would come back and Teghā would go all the way to my aunt's place, three miles away, and deliver the message.</p>
<p>If an animal is evolved and very close to its master, then that animal can do something very, very special to prevent a serious calamity from taking place either in the family or among the very dear ones. That kind of supreme sacrifice an animal can make.</p>

For example, I am sure animals have a heart, but do plants have a heart? Do rocks have a heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything has to have a heart because the soul remains inside the heart. Here is a wooden table. Inside it there is a soul, but the soul does not live directly inside the wood. Inside the wood there is a heart, and inside the heart the soul resides. Without the heart, the soul cannot breathe. The soul-consciousness can be everywhere, but the soul has to have a proper place to live, and that place is the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we increase and maintain our intensity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we increase and maintain our intensity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to value time. You have to feel that you have a higher goal, and that goal is still far away. Always intensity will increase if you feel that you have to go far, very far. Otherwise you will not budge an inch. Let us say that you are now in kindergarten and you have to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. If you are not ready, willing or eager to study, you may take quite a few years just to complete kindergarten. Later on you may become a school drop-out. This is what happens when eagerness is missing. Once you start your journey, your aim should be to reach the goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the spiritual life, we have to have eagerness. Eagerness has the power to create intensity. You can say eagerness is the penultimate step and intensity is the ultimate step. If you have eagerness to do something, you can invoke intensity inside that eagerness. Otherwise, right from the beginning you will be so relaxed and feel that you have Eternity at your disposal. Every day we have to feel that we have been given the chance to accomplish everything. If we cannot accomplish everything today, then tomorrow will come with the same opportunity. But if we feel that since it is something very difficult, we can take ten years or twenty years to accomplish it, that ten years will pass and we may not accomplish anything. Every day we have to have the adamantine will-power to achieve everything we want to achieve.</p>

From your point of view, is there a different consciousness or feeling behind the names?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say 'God', I get one feeling. From 'my Supreme' I get another feeling. From 'my Lord' and 'my Absolute Beloved Supreme' I get still another feeling. A child can call his father by various names. When he uses the term 'Daddy', he gets one feeling. When he says 'Dad', another feeling comes. When he says 'Father', it is something different.</p>
<p>In my case, each time I use a particular name for God, I get a totally different feeling. Again, it may not be the same feeling from day to day. Today when I say, "My Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme," it may not give me the same feeling as yesterday. Not that it is higher or lower in terms of intimacy, but it may carry a different experience. Whichever name gives me the sweetest feeling I use. Again, when I want to invoke God's Power aspect, I say 'the Absolute'.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters differentiate between the Absolute and the Supreme. They say the Absolute does not take human incarnation; the Absolute does not deal with multifarious earthly and mundane activities. I do not agree with them. If I can be conscious of God's Sweetness, then I can easily be conscious of His Might and Power. His Compassion aspect and Love aspect I love. But His Power aspect how can I deny? In my case, I do not differentiate between the Supreme and the Absolute. They are one and the same.</p>
<p>If you use the term 'Beloved', then you connect God's Power aspect with His Sweetness, Affection and Fondness aspects. That is why in so many of my writings I use 'my Lord Beloved Supreme'. It connects God's Power with His Sweetness, Affection and Intimacy. Early in the morning, when I offer my cycling prayer, I deliberately say 'my Absolute Lord Supreme'. This is how I try to invoke the Power aspect of God. Then for my weightlifting prayers, when I say 'my Supreme, my Supreme, my Supreme', it is the prayer of my life-breath. Each seeker will use different names for God for his own purpose, but it is the same Person, the same Person.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any special way to assimilate everything that you have given us on the Christmas trip?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any special way to assimilate everything that you have given us on the Christmas trip?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every morning and every evening, for at least five minutes, please shed gratitude-tears. First you have to enter into your heart. Then you have to feel that you have no mind, you have no eyes, no arms, no legs — nothing, nothing, nothing! No, you have only one thing — the heart — as your possession. Then you have to feel that you yourself have become that possession. It is not that you have something inside which you call the heart; you <em>are</em> the heart itself. While you are the heart, you will become the doer and the seer at the same time. What you are doing, you will observe.</p>
<p>What will you do? For five minutes you will shed gratitude-tears, in the morning and in the evening. If you can offer gratitude-tears from your heart, when you have become the heart itself, then everything that you have gained — everything inspiring, aspiring, illumining and fulfilling — you will be able to keep intact. You are not going to lose anything. On the contrary, all the divine joy and other qualities that you have received here during this trip you will be able to increase in abundant measure.</p>
<p>Also, from time to time you can remember the special occasions during these two months. Remember the very, very special occasions when you were in your highest and when everybody was in a very, very aspiring mood, either in the morning or in the evening, and when I was in a very good mood — no barking, no insulting! Remember when I was in my highest, and how many times I was smiling at individuals, specially at you. You will remember how many times I gave you a most powerful smile, and someone else will remember how many times I gave him or her a most powerful smile. Each individual should remember when he or she received my most powerful smile. Along with other things, each one has to remember the smiles. You do not have to count them! Just remember them — whether it was here or somewhere else. That will help.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes rain disturbed us, but again, we have to change our attitude. If you have to sing a few songs, rain is giving you the golden opportunity to practise. Then, if there are some very special things that you have been neglecting for a few days or for a few weeks, when it is raining you can easily remember those things and do them. In this way, outer disadvantage can be an inner advantage. Every time there is a disadvantage on one plane, we can derive advantage from another plane.</p>
<p>This is how we can preserve everything good, everything divine that we have done ourselves and that we have observed during the Christmas trip.</p>
