  <h2 id="page-title">The hero</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The hero" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>While I was running this morning at 5:23, on the bottom of my mouth I was wearing my mouth retainer, which I use while exercising. Unfortunately, the retainer for the top of my mouth had been eaten by my dogs.</p>
<p>As usual, I was doing my hill work and speed work on 150th Street. First I was running up and down the hill. I would go down 20, 30, 40, 50 and 70 metres.Then, on the flat part, I would run from my starting point to my 500-metre mark. I always run on the side of the street with the cars. Otherwise, the lights blind me. They are so bright, so bright!</p>
<p>A Puerto Rican man was watching me from the top of the hill, where he was waiting for the bus. He was smoking like anything.</p>
<p>This time I ran to my 500-metre mark and kept walking to the 600-metre mark. I saw nobody on the street. But when I reached my 600-metre mark, suddenly I heard a lady 150 metres behind me screaming to me, "Hey Mister, save me, save me!"</p>
<p>So I started running as fast as possible towards the lady to save her. The robber who was bothering her got frightened and ran away.</p>
<p>The lady said, "Thank you, Mister, you saved me. You saved me. This black man tried to take my bags. He had a gun. (Actually it was a toy lee gun.) I had so much money on me because on Fridays I go to the bank. You saved me! I am so grateful to you. Please take this $20 bill."</p>
<p>I said, "No, please." I wouldn't take her money.</p>
<p>Then I said; "Have you heard of Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>She said, "No, I don't believe I have."</p>
<p>I asked, "Have you heard of Guru?"</p>
<p>She said, "Oh yes, of course I've heard of Guru. He is a nice guy, a very nice guy!"</p>
<p>So I smiled at her. But right then the bus came. At that moment she was more interested in catching the bus, so she never knew that it was that "nice guy" who had saved her. Then I ran back to my starting point, next to the bus, and the bus went slowly by me.</p>
<p>The bus drivers are all my friends; they all know me because I run so much on 150th Street. They like me so much!</p>
<p>So this is the kind of thing that happens when I go out to run. Then I went home and did my 100 push-ups for the day.</p>

<p>Nemi's boss, Sandy, completed the whole New York Marathon! Look what determination can do when God's Grace descends! There is a Sanskrit saying that when God's Grace descends, it can give eloquence to the dumb and enable the lame to scale mountains. Here God's Grace descended, and through his determination he completed the marathon even though he recently had suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>One person will run the marathon in two hours and another will have to exercise patience and run it in 10 or 12 hours. The race goes to the swiftest; that is one theory. But in the inner world, the race goes to the one who has utmost patience. Because of our infinite patience, our hope of realising God will one day be manifested into reality.</p>

<p>So many times I have seen Madhuri running in the street and invited her to come into the car with us, but she doesn't see me.</p>
<p>Today I was in the car near my 1200-metre mark, almost at Main Street. The car was going slowly, but Madhuri was running without her glasses, so she was doubly blind. She didn't see me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Saved by the notebook</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Saved by the notebook" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I came out of the house carrying a notebook and a tape recorder, because I had decided I would do hill work in Westchester and dictate some poems in the car on the way there. As soon as I came out of the house, I dropped the notebook — not the tape recorder, luckily. So I bent down with difficulty, because of my back pain, to pick it up.</p>
<p>My notebook had fallen on my left foot. When I looked down I saw that my right foot was dark but my left foot was so white. I said, "How can it be?" On my right foot I had no sock. So I had to go inside and make the right foot white. I always get blisters if I don't use socks. So the notebook saved me. Otherwise, perhaps when I started running I would have been in another world and I would have gotten blisters.</p>

<p>During the 70-mile race, I was admiring Trishul's consciousness. Four or five times I saw him. Each time he saw me, he smiled and folded his hands. He was in a very, very cheerful, soulful consciousness. I was very, very pleased and proud of him.</p>

<p>When he came near me, he stopped making those noises, but then after ten metres he started again. Such a loud noise! Other runners also make noise when they run, but Premik was really something!</p>

<p>But she said she had pulled a muscle and she was still running the race. She was smiling and running. I thought she was coming to sympathise with me.</p>
