  <h2 id="page-title">Dilip the golden voice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dilip the golden voice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dilip had the sweet, sweeter, sweetest voice. Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose, Romain Rolland and many, many others extolled his voice to the skies. These are all non-singers, true, but they were appreciating Dilip on the strength of their oneness, on the strength of their divinity and so many other things.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for singers to appreciate other voices, but there are many, many singers who had the same opinion as these great figures — that Dilip had the sweetest, golden voice.</p>
<p>Once it was a very hot day and Dilip-da was singing a song about Meghnabali, the hero of our clouds. While he was singing that particular melody, all of a sudden there were clouds in the sky and then rain descended profusely.</p>
<p>Another time he was singing and the whole audience was transported to Heaven. Out of the blue, a deer came and stood in front of him. Like that, Dilip-da had many, many experiences. Other singers, specially some of the classical music singers, are unbearably haughty. You cannot go near them. They refuse to accept lyrical songs. Unfortunately, there is always controversy between the singers of lyrical songs and the singers of classical songs. The classical singers find it difficult to appreciate melodious songs and vice versa. Dilip Roy was an emperor of lyrical songs. My songs are also lyrical.</p>
<p>Even now, when I hear Dilip-da's voice on tapes and CD's, it is unique, unique. His is a most haunting voice. To be absolutely frank, his voice has no parallel. If anybody asks me, among the singers whom I have heard over the years, right from my childhood, which voice is the best, I will put Dilip Roy's. His voice is so sweet that it is delicious. It is as if you are eating the sweetness of his voice. I can listen to him singing for hours. I have never heard and will never hear such a sweet voice as Dilip-da had. And he maintained his golden voice to the very end.</p>

<p>Such a great figure Dilip-da was! Such majestic appearance! He had a supremely indomitable vital and he had such charm, such mesmerising charm. The fragrance of his soul and his body and his heart were always available. There was such fragrance in the atmosphere wherever Dilip-da went.</p>
<p>In the Ashram, people did not appreciate it if you wore tulsi beads, japa beads. It was not in line with Sri Aurobindo's philosophy. But Dilip-da was beyond. Some people used to advise him to keep the beads inside his kurta or sweater, but he would not listen. He had to put them outside.</p>

<p>Dilip-da's house was just beside the Bay of Bengal. He was always humming and singing when he walked in the street or along the seashore. A wave of delight would emanate from him. Even if he was walking two blocks away, such charm he had. You could see from two blocks away that Dilip-da's fragrance, charm and beauty were there. And then, while singing in the street, he would raise his arms. Everybody used to get such joy. To see him, was to get immediate joy.</p>
<p>Many times I met him face to face when he was walking in the street and he blessed me with his smiles.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Dilip-da&#039;s free advice to me</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dilip-da&#039;s free advice to me" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once you leave the Ashram, in the opinion of some of the Ashramites, you have touched the abysmal abyss; you are not meant for the spiritual life; you are nothing other than a useless fellow. Then wild criticism you have to face. Dilip Roy was the darling of Sri Aurobindo, but when he left, he had to face lots of criticism. People who once upon a time had been his great friends, his great admirers, all felt that he had descended. They did not want to keep any connection with him. Because of this, Dilip-da suffered a great deal.</p>
<p>Dilip Roy's father, Dwijendra Lal Roy, was an extremely gifted playwright and poet. The entire Bengal knew his name, and people throughout the length and breadth of Bengal sang the national songs that he composed. Such a great writer he was! The song that I always sing very loudly, to my heart's content, "<em>Ghana Tama Sabrita</em>", that is also his song.</p>
<p>When I was still in India, I was inspired to write an article about D.L. Roy in English. It is called, "Mother India in her Sweetest." I sent a copy of the article from Pondicherry to Pune, where Dilip-da was residing. There Dilip-da had established a temple. It is called Hari Krishna Mandir.</p>
<p>I requested Dilip-da to correct my article. He did so and sent it back to me with a letter. In that letter he wrote much about Nolini-da. He compared Nolini-da with his most illustrious father. I showed the letter to Nolini-da and his comment was: "Dilip is really mad! He compares me with his father." This happened in 1962.</p>
<p>After I came to America, again I sent my article on his father to Dilip-da in Pune. This time I requested permission to publish the article in my book about India's spiritual leaders entitled "<em>Mother India's Lighthouse</em>". Dilip-da wrote back to me appreciating the article very much. Then he added, "I am advising you, no matter how much you suffer, never, never go back to Pondicherry. People will say that you have gone to the dogs, but never go back."</p>
<p>I did not mention a word about the suffering that I had gone through in my American life for about two years. But he knew what he had gone through when he left Pondicherry for Pune, so that is why he gave me this most precious advice. Unfortunately, I could not comply with his request. In 1969, after five years in America, I returned to the Ashram for a brief visit and the Mother inundated me with Her compassion and affection. Then my life changed for the better.</p>
<p>That letter was my last contact with Dilip-da.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The magic of Dilip-Da&#039;s name</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The magic of Dilip-Da&#039;s name" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is how Dilip-da's name saved me. It is such a significant story. When I first arrived in New York, I obtained a position as a junior clerk at the Indian Consulate. I worked there from June 1964 until June 1967.</p>
<p>One day I was summoned to go upstairs and see the Consul General, S.K. Roy, immediately. "What have I done wrong?" I asked myself.</p>
<p>The Consul General's very name used to frighten us. He was so strict, so powerful. On another occasion, I was waiting for the elevator. It arrived and the doors opened up a little. When I saw that the Consul General was inside, I ran away. He screamed at me, "Ghose! Ghose! Come in!" I went inside. Then he said to me, "Am I a tiger? Am I a snake? What are you doing? Why did you go away?" I did not know then that he had developed some special concern for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went upstairs trembling. All the butterflies inside my heart were flying! The Consul General said, "Ghose, sit down." He was looking at me very sympathetically. Then he went on, "Here is a letter all against you from the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. It is saying not to keep you at the Indian Consulate. You will cast a slur on it. All kinds of things they have said against you. They want me to dismiss you."</p>
<p>Here I was, poverty-stricken, helpless — and I was on the verge of losing my job. I was earning only $210 per month and, out of that, sixty or seventy dollars used to go for rent. I had a tiny room in an apartment with two other workers. The length of the room was only one foot longer than my height. Sometimes I would get hurt if my feet came down the wrong way. When I remember my poverty, I shed tears.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the blue, the Consul General asked me a question: "By the way, Ghose, do you know Dilip?"</p>
<p>I was surprised. I said, "Sir, do you mean Dilip Kumar Roy?"</p>
<p>The Consul General said, "Yes."</p>
<p>I replied, "I know Dilip-da so well. At the Ashram, I basked in the sunshine of his affection. He was always very kind to me. I can tell you so many stories about him."</p>
<p>"Then say something," said the Consul General.</p>
<p>I started telling him all about my connection with Dilip-da, beginning with my notebook of Bengali poems and the suggestions that Dilip-da made. So many incidents I related. I also told the Consul General that I had recently sent Dilip-da my article about his father, D.L. Roy, and that Dilip-da had sent me a letter highly appreciating the article. I added that Dilip-da had given me unsolicited advice: no matter how much I suffer in America, never to go back to the Ashram.</p>
<p>Then, in front of me, the Consul General tore the letter up into minute pieces and threw them away. He did not show me the letter. He said, "I am a personal friend of Dilip. Now I know what he went through."</p>
<p>About fifteen years earlier, Dilip-da went through the same thing when he left the Ashram and opened up a centre in Pune. The Consul General continued, "Since Dilip likes you so much, the matter is finished." The Consul General smiled at me and it was all over. Can you imagine! The magic touch of Dilip-da's name saved me. Otherwise, God knows, my fate would have taken a wrong turn. My best credential was Dilip-da's affection for me. These things bring tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>Dilip-da was born on 22nd January 1897. Every year, on the occasion of his birthday, no matter where I am in the world, I observe that day with about four hundred of my students. We place Dilip-da's photograph at the front of the room and my students sing the songs I have written for Dilip-da. They also perform plays based on Dilip-da's life. This is our prayerful tribute to his great soul.</p>
<p>Then, the following day, on January 23rd, we celebrate the birthday of Dilip-da's dearest friend, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.</p>
<p>In 1997, on the occasion of their Birth Centenaries, I wrote a series of poems entitled "Subhas and Dilip: The Mystic Friend Versus the Psychic Friend."</p>

<p>In June 1999, I was in India for a few days to visit my brother Mantu at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. One day I decided to visit Ramana Maharshi's Ashram, which is only two and a half hours away from Pondicherry. This was my fourth visit. I went there in 1956, 1958 and again about fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>When I arrived, I immediately felt that the entire Ashram was full of peace, peace, peace. I entered the main meditation hall. The statue of Ramana Maharshi inside the hall is most sacred. In 1956, when I first saw a statue of Ramana garlanded, I felt Ramana Maharshi's living presence inside the statue. This time also, this particular statue was absolutely living. Unfortunately, because of the condition of my knee, I was able to go round the statue only once. Then I sat down to meditate. The atmosphere inside the meditation hall was so sublime.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I wanted to go to the cave where Maharshi actually meditated when he arrived at Arunachala. I was told that it is a forty-five minute walk. Alas, I could not walk at all. When I went there, fifteen years earlier, I saw the cave and I had a very good experience. But this time it was impossible.</p>
<p>I decided to go and ask the President of the Ashram if it is really such a long walk. The President was not there, but the Vice-President was available. His name is Mani Ramanan. He and his older brother Sundaram, who is the President, are the direct descendants of Ramana Maharshi.</p>
<p>I entered into Mani's office and we began talking and talking. As soon as he heard that I had come from the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, he was curious to find out if I had known Dilip Kumar Roy, the Golden Voice.</p>
<p>I told him that I knew Dilip-da in my adolescent years at the Ashram. Then I was able to tell the Vice-President many stories about Dilip-da and my own personal experiences with him. He was so happy and so moved to hear them. He is a great admirer of Dilip-da.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tagore showers his affection on Dilip</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tagore showers his affection on Dilip" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Rabindranath Tagore showed his nobility many, many times. This is one most significant incident.</p>
<p>Dilip Roy's father, Dwijendra Lal Roy, composed many national songs which are extremely soulful, powerful and authentic. Immediately they bring tears. Your tears will be found not only inside your eyes but inside your heart as well. The whole of Bengal is flooded with D.L. Roy's patriotic songs. He wrote quite a few supremely beautiful songs to arouse the slumbering sub-continent. Love of his country welled forth from his heart like a fountain. Some say his patriotic songs even surpass those of Tagore.</p>
<p>One of his most famous songs is "<em>Bharat Amar</em>". This song I sang in public with six boys. According to me, this is our most beautiful, most powerful, most meaningful national song. No Bengali villager will be ignorant of this song. He also wrote many, many plays. Tagore was no match for him as a playwright.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Tagore and D.L. Roy were good friends but, unfortunately, in human life friendship does not last. They became rivals and then they became virtually enemies, and Tagore gave up going to D.L. Roy's house.</p>
<p>Dilip's mother died when he was only six years old and he was brought up by his father. Alas, his father passed away in 1913, when Dilip was sixteen. By that time, Tagore had become so great. Dilip had the strongest desire to meet with Tagore and, at the same time, he knew that Tagore and his father had been at daggers drawn. How could he go and seek Tagore's blessings? Dilip did not dare to go and visit him.</p>
<p>One very famous Bengali novelist, Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, wanted to put an end to this unhappy situation. He had tremendous affection for Dilip and he was also close to Tagore. Tagore once confessed that, as a novelist, he was no match for Sarat Chandra.</p>
<p>Anyway, this great writer took up the challenge. He said to Dilip, "Dilip, do not worry. Tagore will forgive you; he will hold nothing against you."</p>
<p>Dilip said to Sarat Chandra, "My father and Tagore were on such bad terms. Will Tagore agree to see me?"</p>
<p>Sarat Chandra assured him, "You are young. I am sure he will see you."</p>
<p>So, full of fear, Dilip went with Sarat Chandra to Tagore's place. Dilip was then still in his adolescent years. The young boy said to Tagore, "My father is gone. Can we not be reconciled?"</p>
<p>Then Tagore completely forgot his ill-feelings against Dilip's father; his magnanimous heart did not carry any animosity towards the son. On the contrary, he lavished all his kindness, affection, love and blessings on Dilip.</p>
<p>Dilip's nickname was Mantu. Tagore used to call him Mantu. My brother's nickname was also Mantu. Tagore was compassion incarnate. He encouraged Dilip in so many ways and Dilip visited him many times at Santiniketan and other places. This is how Sarat Chandra solved the problem.</p>
<p>In a letter to Dilip, Tagore wrote, "I have a sincere affection for you. My heart is attracted by your unmixed truthfulness and frankness."</p>
<p>This was Tagore's great nobility. Everybody will remember Tagore's greatness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Dilip&#039;s conversations with Tagore</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dilip&#039;s conversations with Tagore" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Dilip Roy had so many illumining conversations with Tagore. He used to visit Santiniketan for a few days and they would talk and talk. They also enjoyed their voluminous correspondence.</p>
<p>One conversation was so striking. Dilip was fearless. He said to Tagore, "Kabiguru [Guru of the poets], your songs, why do you not allow others to set music to them? Forgive me, but they could give better melodies to your most beautiful words. Why not allow them? They are great singers. They will do a far better job. Your own melodies are so simple."</p>
<p>Tagore responded, "Look, I give much more importance to my words than to my music. I am totally identified with the words. Words convey what I have from within. Words convey my feelings. When I write, words come to me first. Then the melody I give. Melodies do not convey feeling. So if others can give a better melody to my songs, I will not allow them because I know the words convey my feeling. They come from me directly. They give me such a sweet feeling. Words are so important in my life." This was Tagore.</p>
<p>Then a few years later, to somebody else, Tagore said about his poems which were set to music, "My words are like widows. But when they are set to music, they become like brides, most beautiful. When music comes, it is like a beautiful girl with all kinds of ornaments. But if the poem remains only as words, then it is like an Indian widow. The words have to give up all their beauty."</p>
<p>In those days, Indian widows could not have beauty. They had to cut off their hair, they could not wear jewellery and they had to lead an austere life. They became simplicity incarnate. They were all the time mourning the loss of their husbands.</p>
<p>To Dilip Roy, Tagore had to say that words come first, he did not care for melody, and then to somebody else he said that without melody the poem is a widow, there is no beauty, no charm. He changed his opinion. He gave two versions and I have read both. The thing is, he did allow five or six of his students to compose music for his poems, but it was very limited.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tagore entertains Dilip and his friends</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tagore entertains Dilip and his friends" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Dilip Roy and his friend, the great poet-composer and singer Atul Prasad Sen and another very great singer, Uma Bose, were invited by Tagore to Santiniketan. When they arrived, they saw that Tagore was very upset. They said to him, "Why are you so upset today? We have come. You always show us such kindness and affection. Today something has gone wrong."</p>
<p>Tagore said, "Wrong? I have just received a letter from someone. He is getting married. He wants me to write a poem on his wedding. Can you imagine? I have to write a poem on his wedding! I am so upset. This is a joke."</p>
<p>Then he said, "Dilip, do not get married. And then, if you do get married, please do not ask me to write poems on your wedding."</p>
<p>Dilip assured him, "No, no, you do not have to worry."</p>
<p>Tagore said the same thing to Uma Bose, "Never get married. Marriage is not good at all."</p>
<p>Then Tagore told them a comical story about marriage. He said it happened in his name, but I doubt it very much. Tagore was another joker. This is the story that Dilip and his friends heard directly from Tagore.</p>
<p>Tagore's relatives found a bride for Tagore. In India, that is the tradition. First the relatives make the arrangements. Sometimes the bride and groom do not even see each other before the wedding; they have such faith in their elders. Anyway, the relatives went to see the future bride and they were very, very pleased with the girl. They said she was most beautiful, plus she was an accomplished pianist. She could also play some other instruments. She was expert in everything. So the marriage was all settled.</p>
<p>Tagore went with a few of his friends to see the prospective bride before making a final decision. After they had waited for a few minutes, a lady who was beauty incarnate came into the room and started playing the piano. She was playing so hauntingly. Tagore was so moved, so excited and so delighted that he was going to marry this particular lady. He was swimming in the sea of ecstasy.</p>
<p>For about ten minutes she played. Tagore could not resist. He said to his friends, "Let me tell her that I am ready to get married. I am ready to marry her!"</p>
<p>Tagore's friends said, "No, no, it is not proper etiquette! Do not do that kind of thing. You will definitely get married, but do not act out of turn. We will make all the arrangements."</p>
<p>They did not want him to misbehave. For ten or fifteen minutes, she played, and Tagore was all the time dying to tell her that he was going to marry her.</p>
<p>Then, after playing the piano so hauntingly, the lady turned to the guests and said, "Now I am sending in my daughter. She will come and play for you. She has been getting ready."</p>
<p>When the daughter entered the room, Tagore's heart fell. She was ugliness incarnate! The mother was so beautiful and they all thought that she was the one who was supposed to be the future bride. Tagore himself was all eagerness to marry her. But she was only entertaining the guests while her daughter was getting dressed. When the daughter showed her face, it was enough. She had no beauty, nothing.</p>
<p>Tagore was so disappointed and disgusted. He did not want to hear her music. He only wanted to disappear. But his friends did not allow him. They said, "No, it is not appropriate, not appropriate. You have to stay here with us for some time."</p>
<p>The daughter played the piano and went away. Then the friends informed the mother that the marriage was cancelled.</p>
<p>After telling this story, Tagore once more advised Dilip, "Dilip, never get married!"</p>
<p>This was Dilip Roy's funny, funny story about Tagore. Whether it actually happened in Tagore's life or not, we do not know.</p>
<p>By the way, I have recently come to learn that Atul Prasad's cousin was Sahana-di, my Ashram mother. What a small world! He himself was an excellent composer. I have freely borrowed the melody from his supreme song "<em>Balo balo balo sabe</em>" for my song "<em>Chalo chalo chalo chalo</em>".</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III - Subhas and Dilip: The mystic friend versus the psychic friend</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III - Subhas and Dilip: The mystic friend versus the psychic friend" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Dilip was born on 22nd January 1897, just one day before his dearest brother-friend Subhas Chandra Bose, who became known as Netaji, the Pilot Supreme of the Indian Boat.</p>

<p>Subhas is power's gong.<br /> Dilip is beauty's song.</p>
<p>Dilip was a singer of the Source.<br /> Subhas was a marcher on the Course.<br /> True, two different approaches<br /> To the Ultimate Reality.<br /> Nevertheless,<br /> They plied their life-boats<br /> Lovingly and self-givingly<br /> Between their reciprocal<br /> Mind-admiration-shores<br /> And heart-affection-shores.</p>
<p>Subhas said to Dilip,<br /> "Dilip, come and join me immediately!"<br /> Dilip said to Subhas,<br /> "Subhas, come and join me wisely!"</p>
<p>God, the Author of all Good, said to them,<br /> "My sons, both of you should remain<br /> Wherever you are.<br /> I want Subhas to fulfil Me<br /> In his own indomitable way.<br /> I want Dilip to fulfil Me as well<br /> In his own inimitable way.<br /> After your earth-departures,<br /> In Heaven, one will march with Me<br />     And for Me,<br /> While the other will sing with Me<br />     And for Me."</p>
<p>From the inmost recesses of his heart,<br /> Subhas confided in Dilip,<br /> "I am frequently in the vortex of politics.<br /> I deal with many friends. Most of them<br /> Are quite often perfect strangers to truth.<br /> At least in you — in your soul, in your heart,<br /> In your life — I have found<br /> An unceasingly dependable friend.<br /> Dilip, how can I ever forget<br /> Your heart's spontaneous generosity?<br /> You gave me ninety pounds<br /> When I was in dire financial need.<br /> A friend in need is a friend, indeed!"</p>
<p>Two affection-flooded friends;<br /> Two mind-confusion-removal-friends;<br /> Two Truth-seeker-friends;<br /> Two true God-believer-friends;<br /> Two consolation-fountain-friends;<br /> Two heart-offering and life-illumining<br />     Friends.</p>
<p>Subhas the Truth-seeker<br /> Or Subhas the God-lover<br /> Remains either undiscovered<br /> Or buried in oblivion.</p>
<p>Dilip is the dire challenger.<br /> With his inner might,<br /> He brought to the fore<br /> His dearest friend's God-hunger-breath.</p>
<p>Dilip wanted Subhas to accept<br />     The spiritual life<br /> In the purest sense of the term,<br /> For Dilip had always found in Subhas<br /> A God-seeker par excellence<br /> And a mystic of pinnacle-heights.<br /> Dilip was all eagerness to bring Subhas<br /> To meet with Sri Aurobindo.</p>

<p>It was Dilip's dream that his dearest friend Subhas would one day accept Yoga and go to the Source, the Goal Ultimate. Then, from the Absolute Supreme, he wanted Subhas to learn how to execute earth-bound ideas and Heaven-free ideals.</p>
<p>Subhas felt that Mother India's liberation should be his first and foremost goal. He did subscribe to Dilip's view that the highest Goal is God-realisation. But he was neither ready nor willing to have that loftiest Goal as his own, very own, for the time being. He believed that when the Hour of God strikes, the Hour itself will do the needful. Subhas wanted to climb up the life-tree progressively, step-by-step, giving due attention to each successive height.</p>
<p>Dilip was adamant. He did not want his dearest friend's burning God-hunger in the inmost recesses of his heart to remain totally, if not shockingly, dormant. Therefore, time and again, he made soulful attempts to bring to the fore his friend's genuine God-hunger-cries. No, never cleverly, but selfgivingly.</p>
<p>In return, Subhas offered his gratitude-heart to Dilip. Something is at once interesting and illumining: whenever he received blessings, concern and goodwill — even indirectly — from Sri Aurobindo, Subhas the heart blossomed into sincerity-appreciation.</p>
<p>[This chapter is an extract from a book which I wrote in 1997 on the occasion of the Birth Centenary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It is entitled, "<em>Mother, Your 50th Independence-Anniversary! I am Come. Ever in Your Eternity's Cries and Your Infinity's Smiles, Subhas.</em>"]</p>

<h2>The birthday of Dilip-da</h2>


<p>I place my head at the Feet<br /> Of the Absolute Lord Supreme.<br /> I am now weaving a poem-garland<br /> To offer to someone who is<br /> A divinely and supremely high<br /> Seeker, singer and poet.<br /> Although I do now know<br /> How to adore him,<br /> I do know that his heart is all affection.<br /> I wish to steal his heart<br /> And I wish to hear his message divine.<br /> Many great men and women<br /> Of teeming virtues come to see him,<br /> As in a pilgrimage.<br /> I do not know how to offer my love,<br /> Admiration and adoration to him.<br /> The language of my silence-heart<br /> How can I express in words?<br /> I am only standing outside his heart-door<br /> To salute him.<br /> This poem, flooded with my admiration<br /> And adoration, I offer for his birthday.<br /> My heart is all eager<br /> To conquer his affection.</p>
