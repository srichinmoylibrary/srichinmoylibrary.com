  <h2 id="page-title">Chaitanya wins over the Muslim soldiers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chaitanya wins over the Muslim soldiers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sri Chaitanya was one of India's greatest spiritual Masters. Once there was a Muslim leader who turned against him. In the beginning, the Muslim leader was very nice and was not against Chaitanya and his followers. "They are Hindus, great worshippers of Vishnu," he said. "There is nothing wrong in what they are doing. It is their faith. Why should we stand against their faith?"</p>
<p>But the leader's admirers and followers said, "They must not be allowed to dance and sing in the street. They are destroying our peace. Let us send our soldiers into the city. The next time these devotees start singing and dancing in the street, our soldiers will beat them black and blue, and they will stop."</p>
<p>After much persuasion, the Muslim leader finally agreed. But when his soldiers went to stop Chaitanya and his followers, the soldiers saw that thousands of people were singing and dancing with them. The soldiers felt utterly lost.</p>
<p>In a half hour's time, the soldiers got so intoxicated from watching Chaitanya dance that they also started dancing. When the Muslim leader came and saw that his soldiers had been very nicely converted and were dancing with the enemies, the leader came and fell at Chaitanya's feet and begged his forgiveness.</p>
<p>He said, "I didn't want to torture you, but my followers instigated me. Now my army has seen something divine in you and your devotees, and my men have joined you."</p>
<p>Chaitanya replied, "Whoever has faith in God and love of God has found the true religion."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Shivaji</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Shivaji" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a great King, a great hero of the highest order, named Shivaji. He was from Maharastra, so he was called the Maratha King. Once he wrote a letter to Tukara, a great seeker who had become a saint, inviting him to come to his palace. Shivaji had heard much about the saint and had developed highest admiration for him.</p>
<p>But Tukara declined his invitation. He wrote back: "O King, you have invited me to come to your palace, but I don't find any necessity to come. You will present me with gifts, but I do not need anything from you. If I want to eat, there are trees bearing fruits. When I walk along the street, I see that people have discarded their used, old clothes, and I can use them if I need clothes. If I want shelter, I already have a piece of metal, and also there are many caves all around where I can take shelter. What else do I need on earth? I cannot accept your invitation and I do not need anything from you."</p>
<p>Shivaji realised his mistake, and he came to Tukara's home, walking barefoot to honour him. India's greatest poet Tagore wrote a most beautiful, soulful and powerful poem about Shivaji. That poem stands as one of Tagore's greatest achievements.</p>

<p>The first Mogul Emperor's name was Babar. He was not as great as Akbar, who was the greatest of all the Mogul Emperors, but he still was a very great Emperor. Since he was the first, he had to fight and fight and fight to establish his kingdom.</p>
<p>Once, with a group of friends and admirers, he went to visit his relatives. On their way back it started pouring. It was raining cats and dogs, and there was no place for them to take shelter. Then, to their wide surprise, they discovered a tiny cave, so they begged the Emperor to enter into the cave while all of them remained outside. They were ready to be thoroughly drenched.</p>
<p>But the Emperor said, "How can I do that? You are my intimate friends and admirers. This protection is not enough for all of us. Since it is not adequate for all of us, I don't need it. I am more than happy to be outside with you."</p>
<p>So Babar didn't enter into the cave. The rain lasted for a long time and the following day they reached their destination. This was Babar's loving oneness with his friends and admirers.</p>

<p>During his lifetime, the Mogul Emperor Shahjan built the famous Taj Mahal in memory of his beloved wife, Mamataj. Shahjan had four sons. When he died, the second son, Aurongajeb, wanted to get the throne. So he killed his older brother, Dara, arrested his two younger brothers and declared that he would rule the entire kingdom. The son of Dara, Solaman, went to Sri Naga for shelter. But the King of Sri Naga, instead of giving him shelter, arrested him and sent him to Aurongajeb, who was in his capital in Delhi.</p>
<p>When Aurongajeb saw his nephew, for a moment he felt sad that Solaman was in such a miserable state. He asked his nephew what he wanted. If Solaman wanted to leave, he would not kill him. But Solaman said, "If you want to fulfil my only desire, then kill me immediately. You have killed my father. Now I don't want to remain on earth."</p>
<p>Aurongajeb said, "What are you talking about? I shall not kill you. I shall allow you to go in your own way."</p>
<p>Solaman said, "I do not need that favour from you. Only one favour I want: kill me here and now."</p>
<p>This was Solaman's oneness with his father. Needless to say, Aurongajeb didn't kill him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Can you tell me where there is no God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Can you tell me where there is no God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Nanak was the founder of Sikhism. He was an excellent, excellent Guru. When he was young, Nanak paid very little attention to sports. Unlike most of his friends, he didn't care for games at all. Nanak always used to think of God and meditate on God. He only wanted to mix with spiritual people. In school he didn't do well because he was all the time in his own world.</p>
<p>Since he was not doing well, his father, who was a businessman, said, "The best thing is for him to go into business." So he opened up a shop for his son.</p>
<p>O God! Nanak was unlike other businessmen. He used to give away money to spiritual people, to saddhus. The father saw that he would soon go bankrupt if he kept his son in the shop. The father said, "In some way this boy has to become worldly-minded. If he remains all the time in the spiritual world, then he will be totally lost and our family will be disgraced." So he asked his son to get married, even though he was quite young. Nanak obeyed.</p>
<p>But again it was the same story. Nanak was praying and meditating all the time. Whenever he got the opportunity, he used to go to see religious people, spiritual mendicants. His wife used to cry and cry for her husband. But what could she do? He was a hopeless case. Finally one day, without any rhyme or reason, the wife died. Nanak was quite happy. He said, "Now I can become a mendicant and go wherever I want to." So he became a mendicant and went to many places to pray and meditate. He used to go to Hindu temples, Muslim mosques and Christian churches alike. He used to go wherever he could find a place to meditate.</p>
<p>One day Nanak decided to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the most holy place for Muslims. During his journey he happened to lie down for a while with his feet facing a mosque. A priest saw this and said to Nanak, "Look at your audacity! You are lying here with your feet pointing directly at the mosque. What are you doing?"</p>
<p>Nanak said, "Forgive me, I am very tired; I am simply exhausted. Please do me a favour. Will you kindly lift up my feet and point them in a direction where there is no God?"</p>
<p>The priest got the point. He said, "You have taught me that God is everywhere. I have been telling people that Allah is everywhere and in everything, and that the whole world is His creation. But today you have shown me that no matter which direction we face, God is there. So you have taught me a most significant lesson."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Cremation or burial?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Cremation or burial?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Usually one spiritual Master is not liked by the disciples of other Masters — especially by those following different paths or religions. But both Muslims and Hindus liked Nanak very much, although he was a Sikh and had his own path. Everybody used to speak very highly of him. As a matter of fact, he had many disciples and admirers who were Hindus, Muslims and followers of other religions as well.</p>
<p>When Guru Nanak died, there was a terrible controversy between his Hindu and Muslim disciples. The Hindus said he had to be cremated and the Muslims said that he had to be buried. What could be done? The two parties were about to fight for the dead body.</p>
<p>In accordance with Indian tradition the dead body had been covered with a piece of cloth. All of a sudden, someone removed the cloth and everyone was amazed to see that the dead body had completely disappeared! In its place were hundreds of beautiful, fragrant flowers. So the Hindus and the Muslims each took half of the flowers.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is absolutely a true story. Real spiritual Masters can perform this kind of miracle. This story tells us that after the soul has left, you can discard the body in any manner you want. If you belong to the Hindu religion, then you will follow the Hindu system of cremation. If you belong to the Muslim religion, then you will follow the Muslim system of burial. But if you go beyond all religions, then you can do whatever you want to. When their life's journey is about to come to a close, some spiritual Masters just run into a river or an ocean, never to be found. Some leave the body through their "sahasrara" or crown chakra. Some set fire to themselves, while others use their spiritual power to invoke burning flames from above, and when the flames descend they are totally burnt. So this is a most significant story.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The son of the Guru is to be worshipped like the Guru</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The son of the Guru is to be worshipped like the Guru" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Nanak's successor was a very good spiritual Master, although he was not as great as Nanak. The successor of this Master was also very good. They were all good Masters.</p>
<p>Nanak's successor had two sons. They thought that when their father left the body, one of them would become the new Master. But the father knew well that neither of his sons was spiritual, so he did not appoint either of them to be his representative. Before he died, he appointed one of his disciples to become the Guru in his physical absence. This made the two sons very angry with their father as well as with his successor. They became very jealous of the new Master, and always they used to speak ill of him. In every way they tried to hurt him.</p>
<p>This new Master was compassion incarnate. He used to say that the Guru's sons have to be worshipped like the Guru himself, because the Indian system is like that. It is said that the son of the Guru is to be revered exactly like the father. But it has happened that the father has been a God-realised soul and the son nothing but a donkey.</p>
<p>One day this particular spiritual Master was giving a wonderful discourse. Many disciples were around him, listening with rapt attention.</p>
<p>Then the Master and the disciples meditated for some time with utmost sincerity. O God! All of a sudden the younger son of the previous Master came right up to the new Master and started beating him mercilessly. Finally he kicked the Master off his throne.</p>
<p>The disciples were shocked and horrified and ran up to save their Master. They wanted to kill the son of the previous Master then and there. But this Master said, "If you are my true disciples, then you must not touch him. I won't allow you even to touch him, let alone strike him!" So they all had to prove that they were their Master's loyal disciples.</p>
<p>The Master then said, "He is my Master's son. Therefore, I have to treat him as my own son. This is our tradition. God will take care of him, so I am asking you not to take revenge. If somebody does something wrong to me, I will remain silent. Let him do it a second time and a third time, and I will still remain silent. But if the culprit does something wrong, something really undivine more than three times, then God will have special Concern for the victim. If the victim is repeatedly harassed or mistreated, then God Himself will take care of the aggressor. In some way God will punish him.</p>
<p>"I assure you, I have forgiven this fellow. He is my Master's son. But if he goes on doing this kind of thing a few times more, then God Himself will punish him. As a matter of fact, he has done many undivine things. This is not the first incident. Soon he will start reaping the fruits of his misconduct. He will be severely punished in the very near future." The Master's prophecy proved to be true. This rogue did something very undivine to somebody else and that person punished the culprit so mercilessly that he was bedridden for months. Even then the spiritual Master said, "I feel really sorry for him. Although God Himself has punished him and he deserved this punishment, I feel sorry that my Master's son had to be punished so badly."</p>
<p>Look at the faith and love this Master had for his own Master! The previous Master's son was undivine, to say the least, but he was always ready to forgive him, just because he was his own Master's son.</p>
