  <h2 id="page-title">Riding with the bank messenger</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Riding with the bank messenger" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father worked for the railway for many years. After his retirement, he opened up a bank. The bank had many workers. They were very fond of me and I was fond of them. Quite often I used to ride behind one of the messengers on his bicycle. Many times I fell off because of my restlessness. Then my father would be extremely displeased with the messenger, not with me, because my father knew that my eagerness to go with the messenger would not permit me to listen to my father.</p>
<p>When I was five or six, I was dying to have my own bicycle. I went to a bicycle shop and asked them the price. I had no money, but I was so eager to buy! The bicycle shop owner said, "Yes, for fifteen or twenty rupees you can have a bicycle." I was so happy and delighted, and I went to tell my father and brother about it.</p>
<p>Before my brother went back with me to buy it, he secretly sent a messenger from the bank to tell the owner to say that he didn't have any more bicycles to sell right now. My family felt I was too young to ride alone. What could I do? I had to be satisfied with riding on the back seat of the messenger's bicycle.</p>
<p>My father did not like me to go riding with the messenger at noon because of the heat. He thought that I would become exhausted and fall sick. But quite often I managed to go anyway. If somebody asked me, "Where are you going?" I would say, "I am just going out."</p>
<p>Often one of the bank tellers would tell me when the messenger was leaving. With his eyes he would signal me when it was time for the messenger to go to the various banks, and also on which side of the building the messenger was. Then when I went out, the messenger would be waiting for me.</p>
<p>The messenger and I had a special signal that we sometimes used. If he was going in one direction, he would indicate that I should go in the opposite direction. Then I would say to my father, "I am going to buy sweets;' and make my father feel I was going the opposite way from where the messenger was going. When I ran out, he would come and pick me op.</p>
<p>Two or three times the messenger and I both fell off the bicycle. Once it was absolutely the worst experience. The messenger took me to a place quite far away to get a toothstick. He was pedalling quite fast, and small branches along the side of the road were striking me.</p>
<p>When we came to a Punjabi-Sikh colony, something really serious happened. The Punjabi-Sikhs were very tall and stout, and they had beards and moustaches. Three of them started shouting and screaming at someone else, but we thought they were screaming at us. I became frightened and fell off the bicycle, and then the messenger fell on top of me.</p>
<p>I started crying, and the messenger was very worried because I was the darling of the family. He knew that my father was compassionate; but he thought that my aunt would not only scold him, but perhaps even fire him.</p>
<p>When I came back that evening and my father heard the story, he was very sad; but he did not scold me. Then he took me to my aunt's house. When she found out what had happened, she was so furious. The next day when she saw the messenger, she insulted and scolded him like anything. My brother also scolded him. That day the messenger took an oath that he would never take me on his bicycle again. But his oath lasted only three or four days!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Which bank has more money?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Which bank has more money?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The name of our bank was Griha Lakshmi, meaning "House of Lakshmi." Adjacent to our bank was another bank called Mahalakshmi, which belonged to someone else. Whenever I sat behind the messenger on his bicycle while he took letters for delivery, I would always ask him which bank had more money: our bank or Mahalakshmi. His answer would depend on his mood. On the days that he said our bank had more money, I would be so overjoyed that I would give him candy. But when he said that ours had less, I used to become so sad that I would give him nothing. Quite a few times he told me very seriously that our bank really did not have as much money as Mahalakshmi.</p>
<p>Once I asked my father if this were true. My father said, "No! We have more money. He is just a clerk. What does he know?" I was so happy to hear that.</p>
<p>My brother, who also worked at the bank, overheard our conversation, and he was very amused. Then another clerk came over and said, "It is good to say that we have less money. Then there will be no robberies!"</p>
<p>My father said, "All right, if you feel that way, we will be happy to say that. But I wish to tell you that we really do have more money. I am not saying this just to console my son."</p>
<p>After that day I believed my father and was so proud that our bank had more money.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Who wants to study?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Who wants to study?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Father used to spend all week in town. He slept in the bank building, where there were many rooms. He came home on Friday evening, stayed for the weekend, and went back to work on Monday morning. From time to time I used to get inspired to go with him.</p>
<p>My brother Mantu and I had a private tutor. The private tutor used to give us our lessons right near the little temple we had for the goddess Lakshmi. The temple was about thirty metres long — about the size of three rooms — and there was also an upstairs.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye I would see my father go to the temple for blessings and then start walking to the small dock to catch the ferry. Quite a few times I tried to follow him in secret. I used to watch him for two blocks and then run after him. I wanted to do it secretly, but my brother and the private tutor used to shout at me, so I was always caught.</p>
<p>When my father saw me, I would start crying that I didn't want to go to school. He would say, "How can I take you with me all the time? You have to go to school!" My brother would tell my mother what had happened. She also felt that I should go to school, but she knew it was a hopeless case. So she would send the servant with extra clothes for me to wear in town, since I would be wearing only shorts and a T-shirt.</p>
<p>Like this, many times I used to go to town instead of going to school. Who wants to study? For a few years I never studied seriously. I would learn from my brother and my tutor. Then, when the examinations came, I would always stand first. Of course, my teacher was also very, very indulgent to me because my father was a big shot in the village.</p>
<p>When I was in town, the whole day I would just roam. I was fascinated by the thieves, so I used to go to court to watch them. I also liked to go to the river Karnaphuli to see the boats and ships.</p>
<p>My maternal uncle and aunt lived in town, and I would always stay with them. This uncle was very close to us. His wife was an excellent cook and could make delicious meals out of absolutely nothing. Often I would spend a whole week there. But if I insisted on staying in town for more than one week, either my mother would come to town herself, or she would send someone else to bring me back.</p>
<p>When I visited my aunts in the villages, my mother would not allow me to stay for more than two days at a time. But quite a few times she allowed me to stay at my uncle's house in the town for a week. I would always cry when I had to go back home. Why? Although I was very fond of my mother, I didn't want to come back home because I hated to study. Studying was too much, too much!</p>
<p>My mother didn't like it when I stayed away too long. It was not that she thought I would become a bad student if I didn't go to school. It was just that I was her dearest child, and without me she used to feel miserable. That was the reason she did not want me to go to town.</p>
<p>During the school holidays my mother used to tell me stories from the Mahabharata. I could not read such big books, but I used to listen to her stories and tell them to my relatives.</p>
<p>Quite often it happened that her only aim in telling me stories was to put me to sleep when I wanted to stay outside and play or eat mangoes. In the late afternoon she would call me into the house and start telling me stories. After five minutes I would pretend to be fast asleep. Mother would be very happy; she would close her book and then watch carefully to see if I were really asleep. But I was watching her, too. Finally she would fall asleep, and then I would get up and run away.</p>
<p>After an hour she would wake up and send the cook and the servants looking for me. They knew what I was doing! They would find me inside the mango garden. I played that kind of trick many, many times.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My father&#039;s generosity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My father&#039;s generosity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It is very hot in India, but since our bank used to serve many Europeans, my father was influenced by the European culture, and he always wore a real suit and occasionally a tie.</p>
<p>In the evening when he came home and took off his coat, I sometimes used to take money from his coat pocket: a few paise — much less than a few cents. I felt no need of asking him or telling him; I just took it. Whenever my mother caught me, she would always scold me.</p>
<p>Once I overheard my mother say to my father, "Do you know that he steals money?""What? He steals?" my father asked.</p>
<p>"I have seen him take money from your pocket," my mother said.</p>
<p>But my father just laughed and said, "My youngest son, my dearest son, has no right to take money from my pocket? Is that stealing?"</p>
<p>"What will happen if he starts taking money from others? I have to intervene before that happens," she said. She thought that if one day I stole from my father, then the next day I might steal from my brother, and the day after from somebody outside the family.</p>
<p>O God, for me even to think of stealing from others' pockets was impossible. But my father took my side. He said, "As long as he steals only from my pockets, I don't have to worry. He is my son, and I know that he will never take from others."</p>
<p>I used to take money quite often, but I never took very much. One day the thief was caught by the victim. My father asked me what I was doing. I said, "Oh, you are my father so it is all right!" My father only laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>One morning when he was planning to do something after leaving the office, he said to me, "Tonight I may not even come home, so the best thing is for me to give you two rupees now. Since I won't be here tonight or tomorrow, take these two rupees. You will need them." So my father gave me two rupees! That was at least twenty times more than I would ever have thought of taking in the first place.</p>
<p>This was the kind of father I had. He used to say to my mother, "Among our children, Madal is the only one who cares for material wealth. We have lost all our other sons and daughters. They all care for God, only for God, so they have gone out of our life. But I have all faith in this one. He is my true son."</p>
<p>My mother was so delighted that all her children were fond of the spiritual life. My father and mother at times used to argue about this. In reality, both my father and mother were extremely spiritual. But, unlike my mother, my father kept his spiritual life a top secret.</p>
<p>I also took money from one of my elder brothers from time to time. He was like another father to me, so full of affection. Otherwise, I didn't take money from anyone else except on special occasions, when I would ask my other brothers and sisters for a few rupees.</p>
<p>Four or five times a year there was a village fair. Before the fair I would go and ask my father for money. Then I would tie it up securely and put it in my pocket. Next I would beg money from my mother and brothers and hide that, too. After that I would go to my sisters with such a sad face, crying that I didn't have any money for the fair. My sisters would also get money for the fair from my father, but since they were older, they would get more than I did. They were always full of compassion, and they used to give me a large part of their share.</p>
<p>When I went to the fair, what did I do? You may find it hard to believe, but I would buy very little for myself — just some candy. I would use all the rest of the money to buy things for my family. When I came back in the evening after the fair was over, I would give them everything that I had bought, and they would get such joy. They were always so moved. After I did this a few times, whenever I used to cry and pretend that my father and mother had not given me money for the fair, my brothers and sisters would give me much more money than they had before. They gave me more than they kept for themselves because they knew that I would go and buy them things.</p>
<p>Later on my father showed me the height of his compassion and affection. He was a gentleman and very well respected all his life. For years and years a barber used to come every morning to give him a shave and occasionally cut his nails. But in the last few years of his life, he used to have the barber come only to give him a haircut. Even though he had enough money, he said that the barber's daily visit was something extravagant and unnecessary. Then the amount that he would have paid for these things, he put in a container and kept on a shelf for me. Quite often I would come and take this money from him. Sometimes I felt sorry because my father was getting old and he was going to all this trouble for me. Just to be able to give me more change, my father started shaving himself.</p>

<p>Early in the morning on weekends, my mother used to come with a glass of water and wash my father's feet with utmost devotion. It is an old Indian tradition. Even though my father had just taken a shower, still she would wash his feet. She also used to wash his feet before he went to the temple. My mother used to touch my father's feet in front of her children, servants — everyone. When my mother used to do that, our love for her would increase. We all had tremendous respect for our mother.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A slap from my father</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A slap from my father" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Only once did my father ever strike me. When I was six years old I got a slap from him, and that was the first and last time. My mother used to slap me quite often, but my father did it only once. I will never forget the incident. Why will I not forget it? Because of a scar on my left wrist.</p>
<p>One Friday evening when my father was back from town, I was bragging that I had learned how to climb up the mango tree in the garden. He didn't believe me, so I wanted to prove that I could do it. I took a big machete and ran into the garden. I wanted to climb up the tree and cut off a small branch from the top to show him.</p>
<p>As soon as I climbed up to the top, the first thing I did was cut a big tendon on my wrist. I started to cry, and the servant who had followed me into the garden climbed up and brought me to my father. My father was always calm and quiet; his soul's quality was peace. But this time he was so upset that he slapped me. Then he told the servants, the cook and my brothers to all run and fetch a doctor. There were three or four doctors in the village, so he said, "Whoever finds one of the doctors first, bring him here!" When a doctor came he said it wasn't so serious. But my father was upset because I was bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>Never, never did my father get angry with me. All kinds of complaints he used to get from my mother about my behaviour, but he was so indulgent to me and always took my side. He never, never struck me except for that one time.</p>

<p>When I was a little boy, I had a small torch — what you call a flashlight — and I used to enjoy using it to look at things. I used to shine it on the top of a mango tree and say I was aiming at the heavens. My brothers and relatives used to laugh.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata there is a story about how the Pandavas tried to walk to Heaven, but each of them dropped dead on the way, except one. We had a cook who was a real joker. He would say, "In the Mahabharata the Pandavas failed to walk to Heaven. Now Madal is sending the torchlight first so we can follow."</p>
<p>My father didn't appreciate that kind of joking. He would say, "Don't discourage my son! Don't discourage children!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A close escape from death</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A close escape from death" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once our family was performing the Kali Puja, the festival of Mother Kali. At the time I was about seven years old. Many sacrifices were offered. The most important was the sacrifice of a live goat. Someone would hold the legs of the animal tightly, while the goat's head was placed at the end of the scaffold. For the sacrifice to be successful, the priest had to perform it with one stroke of his sharp scimitar. If the priest failed on the first stroke, it was said that the devil's doings would befall the family that was performing the festival.</p>
<p>After the sacrifice of the goat, it was customary that fruits also be sacrificed to Mother Kali. In this case also, to make the sacrifice successful, the priest had to cut these fruits in half with only one stroke of the scimitar. Then he would fling the fruit out to the spectators, and the lucky ones would catch it.</p>
<p>When the time came for the sugar cane sacrifice, it was placed on the scaffold that earlier had held the goat and the fruits. The top portion of the sugar cane has a few leaves and is not edible, but the main body of the sugar cane plant is most delicious. I noticed that some of my friends, who had been standing near the top portion of the sugar cane, had quietly moved around the back of the audience to the other side, so that they could stand near the other end of the altar. They knew that the body of the sugar cane would be flung in that direction.</p>
<p>The priest had grasped the scimitar in both hands and swung it above his head, even extending his hands behind his head in order to get better leverage to perform the job successfully. Just as the priest was beginning to swing, I jumped over the scaffold. In the nick of time he halted his swing.</p>
<p>A wave of panic swept those who were watching. I had escaped from a great calamity by just a hair's breadth. Had the priest not been able to stop his swing, I would have been in the other world. Fortunately, the divine in the priest had immediately endowed him with the needful life-saving skill.</p>
<p>My father, approaching me in a calm and quiet manner, embraced me with both arms. There was not a trace of worry or anxiety in his face — only tranquil joy streaming forth.</p>
<p>My father then took the priest aside and said, "You have saved my son's life. Whatever reward you want I shall immediately give you — money, property or anything else I have. I shall give it to you here and now."</p>
<p>The priest still trembling from the experience, said to my father: "Reward! What reward? I have saved my mentor's dearest son! What greater joy can there be on earth than to save my deeply esteemed mentor's youngest son!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My only ambition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My only ambition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Because my father had been a train inspector, we could travel free all over India. Eleven human beings my father could take free: two servants, one cook and eight members of the family.</p>
<p>I used to enjoy riding on the train so much. The trains were long, with many seats inside. In those days they were not so crowded. Now they are very crowded; there is no room. Indian trains were like bullock carts — twenty, thirty miles per hour.</p>
<p>My only ambition was to become a ticket collector or inspector like my father. He started out as an ordinary officer of the Assam-Bengal Railway. Then he became head inspector of the whole line. But God didn't fulfil my desire.</p>
<p>Whenever we went on the train, everybody in the family used to fall asleep during the trip, but I could not wait to see the next station. There people used to carry things on their heads, and they had a peculiar way of shouting, "Tea! Betel nut! Ancient Indian cigarettes! Real cigarettes!" and other things. My mother, brothers and sisters all used to sleep, but there was no sleep for me!</p>
<p>Life is nothing short of a joke! Who ever thought in those days of having trains in my name? Now there are two Sri Chinmoy Peace Trains. One runs between America and Canada and the other circles Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The lion and the goats</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The lion and the goats" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My eldest brother Hriday and my brother Chitta always used to get a hundred out of a hundred in mathematics. They took after my father. My sister Ahana descended to sixty and Mantu to forty. I descended to thirty-three. Fortunately, in the Indian system thirty-three is passing. Sometimes with greatest difficulty I would get forty.</p>
<p>I used to memorise everything in the book, but the teacher would change the questions on the examinations, so my memorisation did not work.</p>
<p>When my brothers were in college, my father used to tell them mathematical equations from memory while he was lying down relaxing. He would help them solve their problems with such speed and accuracy that he always astonished them. Such brains my father had! That is why my aunt used to say that my father was a lion and my brothers were goats.</p>
<p>My mathematics teacher at the Ashram was so nice! He was my brother's close friend and also my family's friend. He always liked me even though I could not learn mathematics well. He tried so hard to teach me, but I was useless. Later he translated the play that I wrote on Sri Aurobindo into Bengali.</p>
<p>Once when I returned to India after I had been living in America, I met my mathematics teacher in a music store. There was only one chair, so he stood up.</p>
<p>I said, "What? What?"</p>
<p>He said, "You have to sit!"</p>
<p>I said, "You are my teacher. I have such love and respect for you."</p>
<p>He said, "How can I sit when now I know who you are?"</p>
<p>He was going to buy a harmonium, but he went away without buying one. I was in the store buying a flute. I asked the owner if my teacher had showed an interest in any particular harmonium. The owner said, "Yes, he showed interest in this one, but he didn't buy it because it was too expensive."</p>
<p>So I bought that harmonium for him. I put it in a rickshaw and went to where he lived. Then I left the harmonium right in front of his door.</p>
<p>The next day he came to my house. Naturally, he knew I was the culprit.</p>
<p>My mathematics teacher's brother had been a pillar of the Ashram. He died about twenty years ago. About five years ago my teacher had a dream. In the dream his brother came to him and said, "Go and see Chinmoy tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>The next morning he came up to my house and was calling, "Chinmoy!" He told me, "In the dream my brother asked me to come and see you." He had such love and respect for his brother. He asked, "Is there any special significance in his request?"</p>
<p>I said, "Your brother didn't tell you that he has taken incarnation?"</p>
<p>He said, "No!"</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely, he is now in Russia!"</p>
<p>"My brother? At least twenty times, when he was seriously ill, he told me that he would go to Russia."</p>
<p>I said, "That is why your brother asked you to come to me. He wants you to know that he is now in Russia."</p>
<p>He was so happy because this was the very thing that his brother used to tell him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Muslim bribes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Muslim bribes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father was an honorary judge in our subdivision. He was a great judge. Although he had many, many Muslim friends, he would never take anything from Muslims because he was an orthodox Hindu.</p>
<p>The night before he was to preside over any serious dispute between Hindus and Muslims, very often the Muslims would secretly bring some buffalo milk and Indian sweets and leave them at our door. Our family drank cow's milk, but my father also liked buffalo milk. So the Muslims would bring him a very large quantity of buffalo milk and also many Indian sweets.</p>
<p>My father would not know who had brought the milk and sweets, but he would never accept bribes, and certainly he would never accept anything from Muslims. He would say, "Who has done me this favour? Take away the sweets and buffalo milk!" My father would not allow anyone in the family to touch the milk and sweets.</p>
<p>The next day in court, the first thing he would say was, "Tell me the truth. Who has put buffalo milk and sweets at my door?" Of course, nobody would confess. Then he would decide according to the merits of the case.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Buffalo milk from a Muslim friend</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buffalo milk from a Muslim friend" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father had four or five Muslim friends who were his great admirers. One of them came to learn that my father liked buffalo milk. So many times he would bring buffalo milk to our house. This man had many servants, but he had such appreciation and admiration for my father that he used to bring the milk himself. My father also went out of his way to show this Muslim friend tremendous respect and love.</p>
<p>When other Muslims used to come to our house, my family didn't appreciate their coming. Even if they were of a high class, we were very careful. We used to offer them a seat, but as soon as they left, immediately the servant would wash the chair with cow dung to purify it. But when that particular Muslim would come to bring buffalo milk, my father would show him such respect. He never asked the servant to purify the house after the Muslim had left. Then, against my mother's will, my father used to drink the milk from that particular Muslim.</p>

<p>Before I accepted the spiritual life, I used to eat fish and meat to my heart's content. The Western world eats mainly chicken and beef, but we ate duck, goat, lamb, turtle and pigeon.</p>
<p>My sisters used to cook. A brahmin servant and one ordinary servant also cooked. God alone knows what my mother cooked! Her cooking was sitting in the temple for hours and hours meditating and praying. I don't think she ever cooked.</p>
<p>Normally we would all eat together, but on Saturdays and Sundays, when my father was home from town, my mother wouldn't eat with me or my brothers because of her respect for my father. She would eat all by herself or with my sisters while the father and sons were eating together.</p>
<p>On my mother's side of the family everyone was thin. My grandmother and grandfather were both thin. On my father's side they were all fat. I was blessed by my father. He was stout. All of my brothers and sisters were also like my father, except Mantu, who was very, very thin.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My father&#039;s Swami cousin</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My father&#039;s Swami cousin" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father's aunt had a son who had accepted the spiritual life and had been initiated as a swami. She was always crying for her son, so at her request my father had to go to see her son at his Guru's ashram and beg him to come back to his mother.</p>
<p>Swamis lead a very austere life. They renounce the world and live off alms. Once a seeker is initiated as a swami, he is not supposed to touch anybody's feet except his Master's. But when my father went to the ashram, as soon as his cousin saw him, he ran and fell at my father's feet. The Guru said, "What kind of disciple do I have? What are you doing?"</p>
<p>My father was older than his cousin, so his cousin said, "This is my older brother. I have to touch his feet." The Guru gave the disciple a compassionate and blessingful smile.</p>
<p>My father told the Guru, "His mother has requested that I bring her son back. She is dying for him. Please allow him to go home for a few months." The Guru kindly consented.</p>
<p>Because of his fondness for my father, the cousin left his Master and returned home.</p>
<p>My father's aunt lived only a month or two after that. The son stayed until his mother died. Then he said to my father, "I have only one boon I want from you in this incarnation." My father knew what it was and said, "Granted!" His cousin would never have to come back to stay with his family again. He would always stay with his Guru.</p>
<p>Once a year my father used to go and see his cousin at his Guru's ashram. Once when I was nine or ten years old, our whole family went to see him with my father. His Guru was very kind to our family.</p>
<p>When I came to America, every day this uncle of mine used to pray that I would not drink wine or lead an undivine life and become corrupted. He had heard that America was such an unspiritual place. He wrote me a very affectionate letter warning me not to be spoiled in America.</p>
<p>This uncle was extremely affectionate towards our whole family. He gave special names to my brothers and sisters, calling them cosmic gods and goddesses. He died a few years ago at the age of eighty-nine. After his death, he came to me and showed me tremendous affection and compassion. Now he knows who I am.</p>
