<p>Every day, sometimes twice a day, I see Madhuri and Joyce running. They are so lucky. But Tanima is so unlucky. She runs with them, but each time, one second before I come by, she goes somewhere else.</p>

<p>This afternoon, around two o'clock, I was running near the school opposite Lavanya's street. Three or four little children came out of the school. One of them, a little girl of five or six, got the inspiration to run with me. So she crossed the street, since I was on the other side, and came running up to me with her books, saying, "Sri Chinmoy, I want to jog with you." She had perfect pronunciation. For her, it was 'jogging'. I had been running quite fast, but as soon as she started jogging, I had to slow down. She ran with me for forty metres and she was so delighted.</p>
<p>When she stopped, I gave her a smile and I continued my run.</p>

<p>Just the other day, around four-thirty in the morning, I was running right behind my house. A young man came out of his house and said, "Good morning, Sri Chinmoy. How nice to see you running." He saw me running early in the morning, so he was very inspired.</p>

<p>In one house on 150th Street there are two ladies who are dead against us. They are very rude. Recently, I was trying to help one of them who was having difficulty getting her car out of her driveway because there were too many cars going by. Finally, I signalled to her that she could go. Sometimes when we help people, our help is accepted. But she ignored me completely.</p>

<p>Some people are always nice to me when they see me running. One fat lady, my friend with the two dogs, is like that. Even if she sees me running three times during the day, she will greet me and smile. Sometimes I slow down when I go by her. She is always smiling.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Simplicity incarnate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Simplicity incarnate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The first woman in our Oregon 30-Kilometre Race was the well-known runner Martha Cooksey. She had come to our meeting the previous day to meditate with us, and she had been very, very moved.</p>
<p>When she was on her thirteenth or fourteenth mile, the other women runners were far behind her. I was in the car, as I had run only seven miles, and I waved to her. She was so delighted to see me waving from the car.</p>
<p>Then, when I gave her the prize, there was only one foot between her existence and my existence, but she grabbed my left elbow and whispered to me, "I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the race very much! " She is so short, but still she bowed down. Of all the women runners I have met, she has the most simplicity. She is very simple, very cheerful and very kind-hearted. If people are champion runners, very often there is something in them which you call pride; or they have a certain way of expressing themselves because they are champions. But in Martha Cooksey's case, she is absolutely simplicity incarnate.</p>

<p>Just before the start of the race in Oregon, the Mayor of that town came up to me and said, "I am the Mayor here. I am so happy and honoured that you are here, Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>Three or four minutes later the race started. I started jogging, and the Mayor also started jogging with me. He was quite fat. I wanted to go at a ten-minute pace, and he ran with me. We were last. After eight hundred metres, the Mayor said, "I am now going home." Eight hundred metres was enough for him. Also, the eight-hundred metre mark was right in front of his home.</p>

<p>In our Oregon race, a man in a wheelchair stood first. He defeated the first runner, a top-ranking runner, by sixty metres. I couldn't believe how fast the man in the wheelchair was going. Then Dayal told me it always happens like that.</p>
<p>The prizes were so cute. The winners got big pies, which were the same size as their medals. They had a special prize for me, which I wanted to give to the man who was in the wheelchair. When I went near him, he immediately started shedding tears. He was so moved that I was giving the prize to him.</p>

<p>Everywhere I run there is a dog problem — even here in Tobago. As I was running this morning, two dogs came and started barking and barking. I thought they were barking because of my red T-shirt. But then I saw that there was a dead dog lying there by the road.</p>

<p>I went out to run after seven o'clock this morning, and I saw a girl running alone. I thought it was Hladini. It was on the tip of my tongue to bark at her, because here in Tobago the girl disciples are not supposed to run alone. But when I came nearer, I saw that the girl was uncivilised. Since her uniform was immodest, I said, "No, no, it cannot be a disciple."</p>
