<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! No, no, no! He has nothing to do with that. The Supreme does not want us to be depressed. Only we say to the Supreme that if He wants us to be depressed for a special reason, then we are ready. That is our surrender. But if we pray to the Supreme to keep us sad and miserable so that we will always think of Him, that is wrong. He is all Joy, all Love; so let us take His Joy and Love. He does not want us to have depression, but we cherish it. Again, what we call depression at a particular moment, in His Eye may not be depression at all. Only we take it as such.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one wants God's guidance, then right from the very beginning one has to offer his mind to God. There cannot be two teachers. So either accept God as your teacher or accept the mind. When you ask God for His guidance, do a favour for your mind. Carry your mind to God as you are carrying yourself to God. Then, both you and your previous teacher, mind, should be placed under His guidance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the divine Will comes and guides us, it is infinitely easier than if we try to enter into it. But again, it is better to enter into the divine Will than to maintain a separate will. If we can enter into the divine Will, then the divine Will can take care of our own will. At that time, our own will becomes more fruitful and perfect. For a child to go and grab the father's hand is one thing. But for the father to come and catch hold of the child is different. If the child is holding the father's hand, then if he sees a kite, he may get excited and let go. Then he will fall and hurt himself. But if the father is holding the child, then no matter how excited the child becomes, still he is safe.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does it truly mean to serve the Supreme in others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does it truly mean to serve the Supreme in others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can serve the Supreme in others, but why do you use the term 'in others'? Right now, you are still wanting in oneness. As long as there is a sense of separativity, you have to acquire more aspiration before you can feel that there is somebody else whom you have to accept as your own.</p>
<p>First is 'I.' Only I exist. You don't exist. When I am in the desire-world I need only my own fulfilment. Then there comes a time when I have to admit that you also exist. When I have accepted your existence, what remains to be realised is oneness. First I will tell you to stay in the street, while I live in a house. Then, I will say that you also should have a good house, like me. Finally comes oneness, and this oneness is founded upon our already established oneness with God.</p>
<p>First I have the sense of separativity. I as an individual am the body, vital, mind, heart and soul; and you as an individual are the body, vital, mind, heart and soul. I still find it difficult to claim you as my own or to see you as my own. So there has to be a connecting link, and this connecting link is the Source, the Supreme. When we aspire, we come to realise that we have a Source and that others also have the same Source. If we do not know who He is, then it will be simply impossible for us to unite ourselves. But right now we do need somebody to connect us. As long as I know that you are His creation and that I also am His creation, I can invoke the Creator to make us inseparably one. But if I have already established my oneness with you, and you have already established your oneness with me, then we don't need a third person to tell us that we are one.</p>
<p>The mind is not allowing us to feel that we are the self-same reality. But if we remain in the heart, then we will never speak of serving the Supreme 'in others.' We will speak of serving the Supreme in ourselves, in our own aspiring consciousness. In the heart we are inseparable, but in the mind we are more than two; we are many. If we live in the mental world, we feel that we are serving the Supreme in many. The mental world will always offer the message of separativity, whereas the psychic world will always offer us the message of oneness, inseparable oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How are we going to be one with the Supreme if we&#039;re still tied up in the physical world, trying to manifest? We&#039;re using up all that we have.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How are we going to be one with the Supreme if we&#039;re still tied up in the physical world, trying to manifest? We&#039;re using up all that we have." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To manifest means to be tied up? That is your conception? When you eat, you enter into the world of food and get the realisation of food; you realise the strength of the food. Then, the next moment, what do you do? You work. You go to your shop, you go to your office and work. First you identify yourself with something powerful; then you manifest it. We say food is God: "Annam Brahma." But material food the body also needs. When your body is weak, you cannot do any work. When you enter into the world of food, that means that you are entering into the world of power, dynamic power. Then you manifest this power through work. So, realisation and manifestation have to go together.</p>
<p>Early in the morning when you meditate, you enter into the spiritual plane, inner plane, where there is Peace, Light and Bliss. That is realisation. Then, the next moment you have to offer it to your spiritual brothers and sisters. That is manifestation. When you are eating you are realising the food-power. When you are meditating, you are realising the spiritual power. Then, the next moment, even if you are talking to some very bad people, you are not disturbed. That is called manifestation. Or you will talk to someone and he will see in you something sweet, something divine, something kind. Most people say nasty, cruel, unkind things, but when you say something, it is kind and sympathetic. So is this not the manifestation of the realisation that you had early in the morning while you were praying to the Supreme?</p>
<p>When you meditate, you are entering into the world of realisation. And after that, when you enter into the everyday world, that is your manifestation. Meditation means realisation of the Highest. What you do after meditation — action — that is called real manifestation. Through realisation, manifestation must come. But if you ignore manifestation, if you ignore the everyday world, you will be living in the sky. If you want to remain only in the sky, it is impossible.</p>
<p>You may feel, "How can I think of God and, at the same time, mix with silly people?" But you can do it. When you drive a car, six or seven things you are doing together: turning the wheel, pushing the pedal, and so on. You have that capacity; you have acquired that capacity. Right now I am talking to you, but inwardly I am doing many things. I have acquired that capacity. So, when you people are one with the Supreme Consciousness, you will not be tied up with anything. But when you are not, then you are doomed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can love God even though you don't know Him in the same way that you can love yourself without knowing what you truly are. Once you know yourself, you will see that you are none other than God. Right now, you love yourself thinking that you know yourself. But that is absurd; you do not know yourself.

How can we learn to love God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What happens when we don't love God? If we don't feel our love for Him in the morning, our whole day is miserable; there is a sense of frustration. But if we do love God, then even if everything in our outer life is unpleasant, it does not matter.</p>
<p>If we don't meditate, no matter how much people appreciate us, we feel that something is missing. But if we do meditate, no matter how many calamities take place, still we are happy. So we have to know what we want. If we want divine satisfaction, we have to meditate on God as soulfully as possible. In the beginning it is difficult because God is only theoretical. But when we meditate for a while, we feel that God is something natural and normal. He is like us, except that He is illumined and divine. We start with the idea that we need God. Then we come to realise that we need only God and we must choose God above everything else. Then, God asks us to take Him as our very own and fulfil Him and please Him in His own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth you have something that keeps you alive, and that is your life-breath. So, if you can feel inside each breath the living Light and living Reality of the Supreme, then you are bound to love the Supreme with utmost intensity. When you hold your breath for a few seconds, you feel that you are about to die. Then, when you breathe, you feel such intensity. Inside that living breath, if you can feel the Supreme's Light and the Supreme's Love, then you will definitely love the Supreme.</p>
<p>This Light has something most significant to offer to your existence. And who is the Source of this Light? It is the Supreme. If you are constantly aspiring to go to the real Source, if you are all the time crying for a free access to the Source, then you will feel a real intensity from your inner cry and aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy to surrender. You have already surrendered to ignorance. You can't say that you have not surrendered to anybody. So you know the art of surrender. You can surrender to the Supreme in the same way that you have surrendered to ignorance. Now you have only to change your master. At every moment you have to feel the need of a new teacher. The new teacher is the Supreme, so try to learn from Him. Somebody has taught you everything wrong; now there is Somebody waiting for you who will teach you everything correctly. The one who has taught you is not the real teacher, but you have surrendered to him for hundreds and thousands of years. Now the same surrender you will have to make to the Supreme, to the new teacher.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please think of the Supreme as your most beloved father, mother, sister, brother, everything. And think of Him as someone who is willing to do everything for you unconditionally. No matter how many things you do wrong, a day will come when He will give you everything. God is infinitely higher and more vast than anything you can conceive of as divine or undivine. All that you have, you can offer Him; and He will accept all your darkness as His very own. He willingly accepts it as His very own. In your case, all the negative qualities that stand in your way can be surrendered if you are sincere. Your sincerity will help in establishing oneness with the Supreme's Concern and Compassion-Light. The more sincere you are, the sooner you will reach your Goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Hope is a power. There are many people who don't hope. They don't know how to hope. They don't want to hope. But that is wrong. Hope is not delusion. Hope is not mental hallucination. No, no. Inside hope there is power. We hope to do something good or to become something good. The very act of hoping is a kind of power. God is still hopeful. That is why His creation still exists. If God lost all His Hope, then there would be no creation.</p>
<p>Then comes expectation. Expectation is also a power, a stronger power. We expect something from our life. Because we expect something, we feel that we can't waste our time like ordinary people. We expect something good, something divine from ourselves. Then, after expectation comes surrender. At that time we don't expect anything. We will do our best and offer the result at the Feet of the Supreme. So we hope to become good. Then we go to expectation: we expect to realise God. Finally comes surrender. Still we expect; but we shall not fix a date: "On such and such a day, I expect to become perfect. If by that time I can't become perfect, then I am giving up the spiritual life." That kind of idea we must not cherish. We shall do the right thing. We shall pray and meditate and leave it up to God to give us what He wants us to have. At the same time we must not feel that since we are praying, God will give us what we want. Some people feel that if they surrender to God, then naturally God will please them in their own way. But I wish to say that this is a very tricky way of acting. God's bargain is not like that. It is not that if we please God in our aspiration-life, then God will fulfil us in the desire-life. No. That is absurd. Surrender means that our will becomes one with God's Will. At that time, we execute only the Supreme's Will. We have no will of our own. So if we execute the Will of the Supreme, naturally at that time our will will be the will of aspiration and not the will of desire.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that the body is also a divine instrument. It is not only the heart or the soul that will work for God. The physical also has to work. If you bake a cake, or if you work at the press, or if you do any other service on the physical plane, feel that it comes directly from God. Feel that the inspiration is coming from God and you are just executing it. As the soul is necessary for the realisation of God, so also is the body necessary for the manifestation of God. You have to keep in mind that this body is not only a lump of flesh; the body is the instrument of manifestation. If you keep the instrument perfect, then only can the player play well. But if the instrument is bad, then what can you do? If you keep the instrument in good condition, then only can the player play. If you neglect the body, then how can the divine Player, God, use the body in His cosmic Game?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I feel that the Supreme is displeased with me and that He is going to desert me.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I feel that the Supreme is displeased with me and that He is going to desert me." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all wrong. It is only we humans who become displeased. The Supreme is not displeased with you. He has many more things to do than to be displeased with you or me. He has no time to be displeased with us.</p>
<p>We have to know that everybody in this world will disappoint us, except the Supreme. You have to forgive me, but I tell you that your husband, wife, brother, sister, mother, father — all will disappoint you. Only the Supreme will not disappoint us. The husband and wife enter the spiritual life together. But there will come a time when the husband goes very fast and the wife says, "Oh, he is going so fast. I am totally lost." Then jealousy starts. When both are running at the same speed, they are very good friends. But then tomorrow the husband will go two steps ahead and immediately the whole world collapses for the wife. Very often it has happened to both husbands and wives. But if we feel that the Supreme is taking us to the goal, if we have faith in the Supreme only, then we are safe. It is absolutely true that we have to depend on human beings; we have to have faith in people. But we depend on human beings because we realise that inside them, God is there. Our faith should be in the Supreme in others. So we have to know that we are trusting someone not because he is good, not because he is great, not because he has done this or achieved that. No, we are trusting him just because we feel inside him the presence of the Supreme. But if we forget about the Supreme and trust someone because he is nice or kind, then no matter how nice or kind he is, we will be disappointed; we will be deserted. But if we see the Supreme inside him, this cannot happen. Even if someone deserts us, even if someone disappoints us, we will have faith that the Supreme in him has not deserted us. Right now his outer existence has disappointed us, the human in him has deserted us. But the Supreme in him will never desert us.</p>
<p>So if we have faith in the individual, then we will be disappointed. But inside the individual is the Supreme, who is your Guru, my Guru, everybody's Guru. Think only of Him. Trust only Him. Then, even if the person disappoints you or deserts you on the outer plane, you will not be miserable.</p>

<h2>Question: Do you see God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have seen God and I see God at every moment. I first saw God at the age of twelve. That was my first concrete, solid and permanent experience of God. Now I see God constantly. For me, God is a Reality which is nearer than my own nose or eyes. When I see a physical object, my eyes are one thing and the object is something else. One is vision, one is reality. This moment I have to become vision in order to see the reality. But when I see God or think of God or speak about God, at that time the reality and the vision are one. Right now, you are the vision and I am the reality, or I am the vision and you are the reality. But when I see God, vision and reality are located at the same place. If I am the vision, then I am the reality as well. If I am the reality, then I am the vision as well. For God-realised souls, the vision and the reality are at the same place.</p>
