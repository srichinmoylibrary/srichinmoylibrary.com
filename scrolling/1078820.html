<p>Pilgrimage, My Divine Pilgrimage.</p>
<p>My Beloved Lord, My Beloved Friend, My Beloved All. You have given me my simplicity. You have given me my sincerity. You have given me my serenity. You have given me my purity.</p>
<p>Simplicity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my body-consciousness. Sincerity You have given me so that I can march along the road of my vital-dynamism. Serenity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my mental vision. Purity You have given me so that I can start my pilgrimage along the road of my heart’s delight.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, You have also told me that my simplicity, sincerity, serenity and purity will reach their acme of perfection only when my heart’s gratitude flowers petal by petal, blossoming to perfect perfection. And for that what I need is constant self-giving — conscious, soulful and unconditional self-giving. In order to have conscious, constant and unconditional self-giving, what I need is a real approach to You — not as a beggar but as a lover; not as a beggar-destitute but as a lover-friend. If I approach You as a beggar, You will give me what I need or what I want. But my receptivity-vessel is so small that even if You give me what I need, it will not be much, it will be far from my full satisfaction. And if You give me what I want, it may not be the right thing. You will give me, but what You give me will ultimately be a source of true frustration and never a source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, even if You give me an iota of what You want to give me, that very iota will not only please the real in me, the soul, but immortalise the human in me. The human in me is my human hope, my earthly hope. Hope before it bears fruit is nothing short of illusion and delusion — mental hallucination, to say the least. But even this very hope You will be able to immortalise. Once my hope is immortalised, I shall see my hope in the form of Your own Reality’s Vision, transcendental Vision, and Your own Vision’s Reality, universal Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Empty Moments</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Empty Moments" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>You are saying that you suffer from empty moments. Do you know why? Not because you have nothing to do. Not because you have nothing to talk about. Not because you have nothing to read or write. Not because your world is wanting in friends. Not because you cannot trust the world. Not because you cannot claim anybody to be your own in this vast creation of God’s. No, the reason you suffer from empty moments is because you are not playing inside the garden of your heart with your heart’s child, the soul.</p>
<p>If you play lovingly, cheerfully, devotedly and unreservedly with your soul-child, then you will never, never suffer from empty moments no matter what the world gives you, no matter what the world does to you, no matter what you are doing and what you will be doing for this world of yours.</p>
<p>You are bound to suffer from empty moments. The empty moments will assail you unless and until you do the right thing, the only thing, which is your constant oneness-sport with your heart’s child, the soul. Something more: you have to realise the supreme fact that a tiny, soulful smile by your soul is the saviour of your life, the liberator of your life and the fulfiller of your life. If you can catch the soul smiling, you are bound to make progress in your inner life and you are bound to succeed in your outer life. And when you smile simultaneously with the soul, you become what you eternally are in the inner world: God’s own Satisfaction-Smile. Not empty moments, but a fulfilled and fulfilling smile is the only purpose of your existence-reality here on earth.</p>

<p>Do you want to be perfect in every possible way? Then let Me ask you a few simple but life-illumining questions. Is your mind receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your mind not to be so doubtful and suspicious all the time. Is your vital receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your vital not to lord it over the world and to crush the world under its heavy weight. Is your body receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your body not to sleep shamelessly for so many hours at a stretch. Is your heart receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your heart not to be so helplessly and hopelessly timid.</p>
<p>One more question you will ask each of the members of your inner family. Is your mind receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your mind to empty itself of all its contents early in the morning so that I can enter into it and enjoy My Satisfaction-Rest at least for seven fleeting seconds. Is your vital receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your vital to spread its concern-wings all over the world. Then what shall I do? Do you know? With enormous pride I shall play with all-loving Concern-Wings with your vital. Is your body receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your body to wake up and look around and discover Me. I am hiding. If the body can trace Me, then I shall be more than willing to play with the body my hide-and-seek game, which even the cosmic gods most soulfully enjoy. Is your heart receptive to a small change? If so, then ask your heart to breathe in only the purity-breath and nothing else. Tell your heart that the purity-breath is the only thing that I live on. When I eat anything else, I suffer from stomach upset and from all kinds of ailments. It is only your heart’s purity-breath that nourishes Me, sustains Me and gives Me the Nectar-Delight and Immortality-Strength to continue My cosmic Game, My cosmic Dance and My cosmic Oneness-Satisfaction.</p>

<p>The ignorance-king, the desire-man and the Compassion-God want me to be their witness. If you want to know how they work, I am more than willing to tell you. The ignorance-king works untiringly. The desire-man works unconsciously. The Compassion-God works unconditionally.</p>

<p>It is never too late for me to become a good instrument of God.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to pray to God and to meditate on God in the small hours of the morning.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to serve my Beloved Supreme inside my brothers and sisters — mankind.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to love my sisters and brothers — humanity — inside my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to tell my sweet Lord that I am only for Him. Him to see face to face, Him to love, serve and fulfil, for this I saw the light of day.</p>
<p>It is never too late for me to learn what I truly am in the inner world and to unlearn what I truly am not in the outer world.</p>
<p>Finally, it is never too late for me not only to have a heart to heart talk with my Inner Pilot, but also to grow into His very image. I know that my Lord Supreme will be pleased with me totally only when I become like Him, another God, for what He wants from me is an equal share. He wants me to be His compatriot and not His slave.</p>
<p>Yes, there is one thing which it is too late for, and because I am too late for that, I am infinitely grateful to my Beloved Supreme. And what is that thing? It is my desire-life. It is too late for me to go back to my desire-life. Something more which is also true: I shall never be able to go back to the animal kingdom, never!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God Has Made This World Round</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God Has Made This World Round" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God has made this world round. Do you know why? Perhaps you do know. As a matter of fact, everybody will be able to supply an answer according to his and her inner light and outer perspective. According to my inner awareness, I wish to say that God has made this world round so that we all can be around Him in a circle, and nobody’s view will be obstructed by others. If some people obstruct our view, then naturally we shall feel sad and miserable. Therefore, God, the Author of all Good, has made our world round so that we can see Him easily and directly; and if we want to, which we should, we must look at Him devotedly and soulfully.</p>
<p>In order to be a member of God’s ring, we have to remain inside our hearts. How do we remain inside our hearts? There are many ways, but the easiest and most effective way is to feel that the ring that God has created for us is not only our saviour-ring but also our brother-ring and sister-ring. If we consider the ring, the round world of ours, as a foreign element or an obstruction and barrier, if we feel that we have to go beyond the ring and, in order to do so, break asunder the ring, then we shall be committing a Himalayan blunder. No, that ring is our oneness-ring from where we can see our Beloved Supreme all at once, according to our heart’s receptivity and our soul’s luminosity and our life’s selfless creativity.</p>

<p>Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my aspiration-free world but also my desire-bound world to all those who are around me.</p>
<p>How can I become a cheerful and soulful giver in order to liberate myself and liberate others? I can become a cheerful and soulful giver provided I can feel that a giver is he who is also a receiver. The greater a giver he is, the better a receiver he becomes. He gives because he feels that that is the only way to please the real in him, the soul. The real giver gives to the world his soul’s all-illumining beauty cheerfully and soulfully, and never, never does he give his body’s ugliness-dream.</p>

<p>"My Lord Supreme, is it my fate that I shall have no shortcut to my satisfaction-goal? Everybody knows that there is a shortcut to the goal, but in my case I have not yet discovered that shortcut. You want me to love the world, You want me to serve the world because inside the world is Your own Reality-existence. But this world of Yours was not ready, is not ready and perhaps will never be ready for any chosen instruments, supremely chosen instruments, to awaken the slumbering human life. No! No spiritual figure has ever succeeded according to Your inner Volition.</p>
<p>"Perhaps You expected, expect and will always expect more than the sleeping world can offer to You, to Your direct emissaries. My Lord Supreme, do tell me what was the main obstacle and what is the main obstacle for my brother-sister friends who came into the earth arena to change the face of the world radically as I am also trying to do?”</p>
<p>“Only one obstacle you have, only one obstacle they had, and this obstacle is, and has always been, insurmountable. Do you know what that obstacle is? Disobedience, which grows into world-defiance. The seed of this disobedience is lack of oneness-heart. My son, unfortunately there is no shortcut for you, for you have become inseparably one with Me. God-realised souls have no shortcuts, for they have accepted My burden as their own burden. This world denies and defies all shortcuts, but you and I and others who are in the same boat have to make friends with our Eternity’s patience.”</p>

<p>What am I doing? Am I loving God the man? No. Am I serving man the God? No.</p>
<p>What am I doing? Am I crying for a better world? No. Am I thinking of transforming my outer life? No. Am I contemplating fulfilling my inner life? No.</p>
<p>What am I doing? Am I desiring a world-destruction? No. Am I desiring to start a new life, so I can play once more like a child — carefree, with no mind, no thought, no doubt, no suspicion, no fear, no anxiety? Those golden days of my childhood am I longing for? No, no.</p>
<p>What am I doing? Am I showing my excessive attachment for heavenly bliss, for the cosmic gods and goddesses? No, no. Am I showing a bitter, disgusted repulsion for the world, for this uncomely, unaspiring world? No, no.</p>
<p>What am I doing, then? I am just sailing my hope-boat towards a shore. Perhaps it is an uncertainty-shore and perhaps it is a dream-blossomed shore; but I do not know and I do not want to know, either. If I know that it is an uncertainty-shore, then I shall be doomed to destruction-frustration, and if I know that it is a dream-blossomed shore, then shameless complacency-relaxation will percolate through my entire being and dominate my earthly existence. Therefore, I leave my fate entirely at the Feet of my fate-maker, my Beloved Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Without Man And Without God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Without Man And Without God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Without man can I do anything? Yes, I can. Without man I can do many, many, many things, if not each and every thing. If I pray to God to grant me the capacity to do everything without man’s help, humanity’s help, I am sure He will grant me the boon.</p>
<p>Without man I do so many things precisely because my Almighty Father, My Beloved Supreme, has given me the capacity. I look at my powerful brother, the sun, without man. I look at my beautiful sister, the moon, without man. I look at my sweet children, the stars, without man. I look and look at my Father, God, without man. I look at my Mother, God, without man.</p>
<p>But can I do anything without God? No, impossible! Why? I cannot do anything without God because I cannot live without God. How is it that I cannot live without God? Is it because He is all Kindness, all Love? No, no! Is it because He is all Concern, all Compassion? No, no! Is it because He is all-where? No, no! Is it because He is my essence and my substance? No, no!</p>
<p>Then why is it that I cannot live without God? I cannot live without God precisely because I cannot live without that which I have and that which I am. Can you live without what you have and what you are? Impossible! If you have light, you live in light and you are that light Itself. And if you have God within you, then you not only possess God but you are that very God. It is like a deer that has fragrance, musk. When the deer develops musk, the deer and the musk are inseparable. When the flower has fragrance, the flower and the fragrance are inseparable. Similarly, God the Beauty that is within me and God the possessor of the Beauty are inseparable. Therefore, I cannot live without God, for He is what I am and what I have. You too cannot live without what you have and what you are. What you have and what you are will always be the same Reality-Existence: God. Therefore, you and I cannot live without God, not to speak of doing anything without God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My Heart-To-Heart Talk</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My Heart-To-Heart Talk" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>"O man, let Me have a heart-to-heart talk with you. Man, I love you and I serve you. But you do not believe in My Love, you do not believe in My Service. To My sorrow you suspect Me. To My sorrow you feel that My Love is binding you, binding you to the earth-bound reality. You feel that My Love has enchained you, entangled you, encaged you. You want to be a free bird, a free reality-existence, but you feel that My Love for you is binding you in every possible way. This is the realisation you have come to, man.</p>
<p>" I am having a heart-to-heart talk with you, so I wish to tell you that in no way am I binding you. I am only helping you, with My Love and with My Service, to become one with vastness, one with immensity, one with God’s Eternity, Infinity and Immortality, one with Oneness-Delight itself. This heart-to-heart talk of Mine, man, one day you will believe. One day you will have faith in My soulful Message, My Life’s breathless Message, that I have just offered to you."</p>
<p>“O Lord, let me have a heart-to-heart talk with you. O Lord Supreme, I do not love You, I do not serve You, in spite of the fact that at times I am fully determined to love You and serve You conditionally, even if it is not within my capacity to love You unconditionally. But alas, I fail to love You even conditionally; I fail to serve You even conditionally. My Lord Supreme, is it because I love mankind more than I love You? Is that why real love does not come from me towards You? Is it because You are not to be loved the way I want to love You, with all my earthly needs and heavenly needs, with all that I think of as my needs? Is it because I am self-sufficient without You? To be without man is not an impossibility; but to be without You is impossibility itself. But is it because to some extent I can live without You? When I live in my ignorance-night, I do not live in You or for You. Or is it because my pride, my disproportionate pride, finds it beneath its dignity to live with You inside mankind? Is it because of all this that I am separated from You and find it impossible to offer true love to You? My Lord, will I ever be able to love You devotedly, will I ever be able to serve You soulfully, will I ever be able to claim You as my own, very own, founded on the inner conviction that You are mine and I am Yours? Will I ever be able to serve You and love You to my heart’s content?”</p>
<p>“My child, what do you want? Do you want to love Me or do you want to prove to Me that you love Me? There is a great difference between your love for Me and your demonstration of love. Your love of Me and your wish to demonstrate your love for Me are two different things. You do not have to demonstrate your love to Me as long as you have the inner cry to love Me. This inner cry is not theoretical, but practicality itself. It is the height of practicality. I am the eternal Lover and you are My mirror, so you have to know that when I look at you I see My own reflection. Remain My mirror and My Love of you will be your love for Me, for I see Myself alone here on earth and there in Heaven. I do not see anything as something other than Myself. I do not see anybody as someone else. I see only Myself, My larger Self, My universal Self, through you, My mirror. Through you I see Myself, My own reflection. Therefore, you do not have to prove your love for Me. Just maintain your inner cry to love Me devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally. This inner cry is not only My divine Will in you, but it is also My supreme execution of My divine Will in and through you.</p>
<p>"I love My creation. Therefore, I live in My creation. If it just cries to love Me, that is more than enough. I need no other proof. That is proof itself: the cry, the cry, the soulful cry, only for Me, only for Me.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Never Make An Outer Promise</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Never Make An Outer Promise" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My brother Chitta used to tell me, “Never, never make an outer promise. Only promise to yourself inwardly what you want to do in your life and with others’ lives. The moment you outwardly tell the world what you are going to do, or what you expect others to do for you, for others, or for themselves, the hostile forces will invariably attack you directly. Then other undivine forces will try to enter into you: humanity’s jealousy, humanity’s insecurity, humanity’s doubt and many wrong forces.</p>
<p>“When your promise is in the inner world, the undivine forces remain dormant. They think that it is just wishful thinking. When you are talking to yourself inwardly, they think it is not really a promise. But when you open your mouth for the public to hear, for humanity to hear, then you are exposed. At every moment your inner will has to come forward to fulfil your promise; otherwise, if you are unable to fulfil your promise, you will be assailed by self-doubt and self-mockery. The world does not have to mock at you. You yourself, your own sincerity, will mock at you. So it is better to keep your promise inside your heart: not to deliver it from your tongue and not to keep it even on the tip of your tongue.”</p>
<p>Here I am not listening to my brother; I am not doing the right thing. All the time I am making outer promises: I will write so many songs, I will paint so many pictures, I will do this, that. But in my case, I am a spoiled child in the family. I do exactly the opposite of what they ask me to do. Therefore, I am paying the penalty very nicely with my disciples. And I am not only the spoiled child in my family, I not only exploited my family’s affection and love, but I also exploit the Love, Affection, Blessing and Compassion of my Beloved Supreme every day, every hour, every minute, every second. I always feel that if something comes out of my mouth, then He will be there to keep my promise, justify my promise. This is my inner conviction. I know I was nothing, I am nothing, I will remain nothing in humanity’s eye. But in my Father’s Eye, in my Father’s Heart, I am everything, for I love Him, I need Him only, only, only.</p>
