<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is so clever. He has to keep some impossibility for human beings. Otherwise, there will be no difference between God and man. If man can do everything, then he will no longer need to pray to God for anything.</p>
<p>But as soon as we realise God, God gives us some wisdom. He says, "What do you want? Do you want to get happiness by straightening a dog’s tail, or do you want to get joy by letting it remain as it naturally is?" God always says, "Be natural, be natural!" Natural things give us joy. That is why God does not want people to interfere with His creation by trying to straighten a dog’s tail.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This question is very easy. When you want to eat an egg, at that time the egg came first. When you want to eat chicken, then the chicken came first. Whatever we love most comes first in our minds. If we love someone, that person always comes first for us. Since we love God, God comes first. Similarly, if you want to eat an egg, an egg comes to your mind first. Naturally, if you love to eat chicken, then the chicken will come first. So it depends entirely on your choice. Whatever comes to your mind first was definitely created before the other choices. And every day it can change.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created flies and insects to make Himself perfect. Otherwise, you will say that God is only good. No, God needs all qualities in His creation, both good and bad. Flies cause irritation. This irritation is not a good quality, true. But God had to create that quality too, to prove that He is both night and day, good and bad. God said, "I am in the fly, and I want to develop irritation-power so I can say I know I have that capacity. Then only can I be completely perfect."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I won't mind, but your soul will mind. If you can get permission from your soul, I have no objection.

But, in all sincerity, I have to tell you that your soul does not care for caviar; your soul will not approve of it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God works very hard day and night. Sometimes He needs rest. He was clever enough to do something. Boyfriends and girlfriends think of each other all the time; they don’t think of God. So if they don’t think of God, God does not have to worry. They can think of each other and He can take rest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How I wish to kill myself running! If I can kill myself running, then perhaps I can become a good runner. By dieting and not running, one becomes weak and at the same time one remains a useless runner. So it is better to lose weight by running than by dieting. At least if you die, you are dying for a good cause, and Heaven's door will be wide open for you because you died on the battlefield of running.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a thorn in your foot, then you use another thorn to take the first one out. Then afterwards you throw both out of your system. Similarly, you already have so many junk qualities in your system. So if you add more to your system, then perhaps this new junk will take all the old junk qualities out, like taking out a thorn with a thorn.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can make progress through eating if you take food as cosmic energy. No matter what you eat, if you feel that you are putting into your system cosmic energy, then you can make inner progress. Also, if you are planning to become one of the heroes of the Mahabharata, like Bhima, who used to eat voraciously and had great physical strength, plus unlimited energy, then while eating feel it is not food but cosmic energy that you are bringing into your system. If you can do that, then you can make real progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly there will be one. And when there is one, we shall have you as the caretaker of that place. The other day I was told that somebody referred to you as, "Oh, that old man." You are not even forty; you are just over thirty. Look at this human being: in spite of having two eyes, he cannot see that you are so young! The day before yesterday I was coming back from a four-mile run. A fat old man stopped me and said, "You are still running! You don't want to grow old." So here I wish to say that people who aspire will never become old. They will always be children in the heart of the Beloved Supreme. And again, from the earthly point of view, when old age attacks us, naturally we will have a house, a home for old disciples. And I will think of you at that time to take care of these disciples. Even if you are physically not in America, but in Australia, you will be able to send your soul and spirit to take care of these old people.</p>
