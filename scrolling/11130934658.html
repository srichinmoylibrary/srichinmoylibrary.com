<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody says that he is God-realised, how will he prove it? He won't prove it by having two big horns or any other physical characteristics. He will be able to prove to others that he has realised God by bringing down Peace, Light and Bliss from above in infinite measure. When you see a spiritual Master, he may have all kinds of physical defects. But you have to try to see and feel the consciousness in him. In his presence, if you feel that your consciousness is elevated, then you will know that he has realised some Truth, some Light, some Peace from above.</p>
<p>God-realisation means conscious oneness with God, and in this conscious oneness one feels complete satisfaction. God-realisation is complete inner satisfaction. But there is a need for complete satisfaction in the outer life as well. This satisfaction comes from God-manifestation. God-realisation will give satisfaction in the inner life, true. But when a spiritual Master has to deal with imperfect, impure people, then you cannot expect perfection. If the Master has realised God, then in his inner life he is perfect. But in his outer life also he has to become perfect. Since he has accepted disciples as members of his spiritual family, his outer perfection depends on the perfection of his disciples. So God-realisation is constant satisfaction in one's inner life and God-manifestation is constant satisfaction in one's outer life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we chant <em>Aum,</em> we enter into a higher realm of consciousness. <em>Aum</em> embodies God in His three aspects: God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Transformer. There are many who feel that God is a destroyer, not a transformer. But our philosophy says that God cannot destroy. He can only transform the things that are undivine in us. God has some wisdom. He will not create something just for the sake of fun and then destroy it for the sake of fun. No! He does not destroy us; only He transforms what is undivine in us.</p>
<p><em>Aum</em> is the mother of all mantras. 'Mantra' means incantation. You can realise God just by chanting <em>Aum</em> most soulfully. That is enough, because with this mantra, you are invoking God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I chant <em>Aum,</em> immediately I feel inside my heart the presence of the cosmic gods and the Supreme. When we chant, we are feeding our nearest and dearest ones.

Sometimes they are hungry and at that time I feed them. Sometimes I am hungry, so they come and feed me. We have to nourish each other.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My eyes I keep half-closed because I feel that this is the most effective way to have full control over both the physical world and the spiritual world. If I keep my eyes wide open, at that time my eyes are very strained and I see only what is happening in this world. But if I keep my eyes half-open, then I am communing with my inner beings and, at the same time, I am seeing the outer beings, human beings, who are in front of me. So I am killing two birds with one stone. I am getting the wealth from the inner world and distributing it to the outer world. When I do this, on the one hand I am receiving and on the other hand I am offering.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> After a spiritual Master has attained God-realisation, if he wants to maintain likes and dislikes on the physical plane, he can do it. Likes and dislikes on the physical plane need not and cannot take away the realisation of a spiritual Master or prevent them from manifesting the Truth.</p>
<p>You ask why a Master should not act in a normal way. But who is normal here? To me, only spiritual people are normal. After God-realisation, we feel that only he who has realised God is normal. We are all abnormal people if we don't do the first thing first. In the spiritual life, God-realisation is the first thing and absolutely the normal thing to do.</p>

I enjoy infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. In samadhi, we do not see God as something to be achieved or something foreign to us. His whole Consciousness inundates us to such an extent that we don't feel that God is somebody other than ourselves. At that time, we feel that we have become totally one with God and that He and we are absolutely one.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I will describe them as my own spiritual children. My love for them is boundless and infinite. But I will not say that my children are by far superior to others. In an ordinary family, the parents will always extol their children to the skies. They will say, "My children are all divine. They are absolutely perfect perfection." But in my case I will say, "My children have imperfections, they have limitations, but they are trying. As other spiritual Masters have their spiritual children and are teaching them in a particular way, so also I have my disciples and I am teaching these children of mine in my own way." When it is a matter of comparison, I will not say that my children are superior to others. Only I will say that my children are eating the food that I have in my refrigerator. They like my food; so I am giving them this food. Others who do not like my food go to other Masters and eat their food.</p>
<p>I always tell my children not to make any comparison. I say, "You love me and I love you; that is enough." It is our mutual love that has compelled us to stay together in the same boat. Otherwise they would go to some other boat, to some other Master. It is the love-aspect of our inner life that has made me very close to them and made them very close to me. Our path is the path of love. We feel that love is the greatest knowledge, the greatest wisdom, the greatest treasure.</p>
<p>We are offering divine love, the love of oneness. When this oneness is manifested totally, the Universal Heart becomes ours. Right now each of us has a limited heart. But when you are one with me, when he is one with me, when she is one with me, at that time we become universal. When we have the Universal Consciousness at our disposal, we feel that we are perfect.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can I make the fastest progress?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First pray for gratitude, Pray to the Supreme for gratitude and offer gratitude to the Supreme. This is the first lesson. There are millions of people on earth who are not praying and meditating, but you have been given the inspiration to pray to the Supreme. So naturally you are grateful.</p>
<p>In some cases the disciples feel that they are not sincere, that they are not pure. But this only hinders their progress. When you think of sincerity, think of it in such a way that your mind does not get a chance to bring forward your insincerity. When you repeat, "I want to be sincere, I want to be sincere," this does not mean that all the insincere actions that you did yesterday must come forward. Use the positive side, "I want to be sincere, I want to be sincere," and offer your sincerity to the Supreme. Don't consciously think of insincerity or cherish insincere thoughts. While you are praying for sincerity, if they come, well and good. You will offer them to the Supreme. Otherwise, your prayer for sincerity has to become one with the light, since prayer itself is light, and that light will enter into you in the form of sincerity. Prayer is like a magnet bringing light, and that light will illumine your insincerity. But consciously if you think of your impurity and insincerity, then purity and sincerity will never visit you. If they come, they will be totally lost. Your prayer for purity, your prayer for sincerity is enough. Your prayer is bringing down light and that light will enter into your obscure vital and illumine you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Anybody can know whether he is ascending or descending. When you are descending, immediately your inner joy, your inner satisfaction goes away. You can fool others, but you can't fool yourself if you are sincere. You can try to fool yourself or deceive yourself by grasping some divine quality with your mind or your vital. But when your inner world becomes barren, you really feel miserable if you are sincere. If you don't feel miserable when your inner life is barren, that means that you are trying to convince yourself that nothing is wrong, when actually everything is wrong. Your house is totally burnt down, destroyed, but you say, "Oh no, my house is not burnt. This is not my house. My home is somewhere else." But you definitely know that it is destroyed. Or if you have one dollar and then you don't see it again, you know that you have lost it. How can you say that you have not lost it? It is just a dollar, but you know that it is gone.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how do we get so fooled that we don&#039;t know exactly when we lose some divine qualities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how do we get so fooled that we don&#039;t know exactly when we lose some divine qualities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you lose something, for a few days you feel a little sad. Then, afterwards, the thing that you lost does not come to your physical mind. You feel that you did not have that very thing or that the thing which you lost was not important.</p>
<p>In this world people are so clever in deceiving themselves. They achieve something today and they are satisfied. Then they lose that thing and still they are satisfied. We think this means that we are perfect. But here we have to know that it is not true. It means that we don't have aspiration, that we are like absolutely ordinary human beings. They say, "If you get something, well and good; if you don't get something, well and good." This is the attitude on the lowest plane, where there is no aspiration. When there is no aspiration, people lead a very ordinary life. If one day they get a morsel of food, they are satisfied; another day, if they don't get food, again they will accept this.</p>
<p>But spiritual people aspire to go high, higher, highest, and then they surrender to God's Will. If God feels that they should wait at one point for a few days before climbing up still higher, then they wait. But there is a great difference between these people and absolutely undivine people who are not aspiring at all. The undivine people are happy; but their happiness is the happiness of inconscience, where there is no light. Your happiness will come when you go up high, higher, highest and then surrender yourself to God's Will. When you surrender to God's Will, God Himself will take care of your life.</p>
<p>Just think of where you were six months ago, eight months ago, one year ago. Immediately you will see that you have lost the intense feeling that you had for the inner life when you first began. But the spiritual life should not be like that. You have to feel that every day means new hope, new life. The journey is eternal. Every day you have to feel that there is something new to achieve, something new to grow into. Every day, when morning dawns, feel that you have something new to accomplish. You are running and every day you are advancing one step ahead. You are always in the process of running in the inner life. Each day please feel that you have to cover one metre more.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that what you have lost is really something worth having. If you have lost something and you feel, "Oh, that thing that I have lost is not worth anything," then you will never get it back. Some people are so clever. They try to be happy by forgetting about what they have lost. But that is no good. If you forget about what you have lost, then you will not try to regain it. Only by running for it will you get it again. Again, it is not good to feel miserable all the time because you have lost something. But you do have to feel that the thing you have lost is very valuable.</p>
<p>If just for twenty-four hours you are repentant, then you will not get it back. You will only say, "I have lost it, I have lost it, I have lost it." You have lost it, that is true; but what are you doing to gain it back? It is easy for me to say that I have lost ten thousand dollars. But by repeating, "I have lost ten thousand dollars," I am not going to get back one cent. I have to work hard again in order to make ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Now I have lost my inner wealth, which to me was very significant, very important, very valuable. That very thing I want to get back again. And how do I get it? It is through aspiration. I have to work hard. If I work hard, my work itself is my aspiration. If I again aspire then I will get back my inner wealth and reach my highest standard.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is suffering necessary for spiritual progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is suffering necessary for spiritual progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my personal belief, according to my own realisation, suffering is not to be glorified. No! We suffer because we identify ourselves with ignorance. When we are in the vital world, we suffer. When we are in the emotional world, we suffer. When we do something wrong, we suffer. God is not imposing suffering on us; far from it. But if we have done something wrong and the Cosmic Law offers us suffering, then we have to feel that this is something that we need for our own progress. When we do something right, even then sometimes we suffer. The world does not understand us; the world finds it difficult to see the truth in us, and we suffer.</p>
<p>We have to know that we have come into the world to fulfil God's Will. If it is God's Will that we undergo suffering, then we shall have to accept it. But by praying to God and meditating on God, we can change His Will. If we do the right thing, if we act divinely, then He will minimise our suffering or He may eliminate it altogether.</p>
<p>If suffering comes, we have to face it; we have to accept it as an experience on our way. But we do not have to add to our suffering in order to make further progress. We do not have to glorify suffering in order to make higher progress. I don't have to cut off my arms or my nose in order to go to my Eternal Father. I don't have to prove to Him how much I have suffered in order to reach Him. He is my all-loving Father and I have to approach Him with all my love.</p>
<p>Why do we suffer? We suffer because we do not identify ourselves with our inner joy. There is abundant joy in our inner being, but we do not consciously or even unconsciously identify ourselves with the joy that we have within. Many times we consciously and deliberately identify ourselves with outer suffering. Then we are caught in the prison cell of suffering and we don't want to come out. At that time suffering enters into us and plays its role and we cherish it. Then we are helpless.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, there are many undivine qualities that add to our suffering: fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, depression, jealousy and so forth. When we are a victim to doubt or fear, we suffer mercilessly. But for this suffering we ourselves are responsible. God has given us the necessary faith to know that He loves us and thinks of us and meditates on us. So why should we doubt either God or our own existence?</p>
<p>An aspirant has to feel that God is all the time thinking of us, whether we think of Him or not. But if we are not seekers, then we can never have that feeling. We will think that since we are not thinking of God, then naturally God is also not thinking of us. That is our realisation. But when we follow the spiritual life we come to know that God thinks of us infinitely more than we think of ourselves. Such being the case, we must not be victims to fear, doubt and anxiety, which all contribute to our suffering.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is this: from light we shall grow into more light, abundant light, infinite Light. From joy we shall grow into more joy, infinite Joy. We shall go ahead and not go backwards. We shall not stay in the dark room of suffering. We shall only move forward to the room that is light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we avoid tension in our aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we avoid tension in our aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can avoid tension in our aspiration if we know how to observe our life properly and wisely. On the one hand, we have to say that every moment is a golden opportunity. We have to feel that if we lose this moment, if we lose this golden opportunity, then we are going to lose everything in God's creation; there will be nothing left for us. We will be totally lost. That is why we won't waste any time. We have today, here and now, or nothing. We have to fight for the light immediately.</p>
<p>God-realisation is such a difficult thing. God-revelation is more difficult and God-manifestation is even more difficult. So the best thing is to be sincere and dedicated and to do everything unconditionally so that we can realise God. We have so many things to do. If we don't do the first thing first, then how shall we reveal God and manifest God?</p>
<p>But there is also another approach. We will do whatever we feel is best for our body, vital, mind, heart and soul. But at the same time we will keep in mind that Eternity is at our disposal. Our source is God, the Infinite, the Eternal. If God is eternal, then naturally we also are. Whatever God is, we also are. If God is dealing with Eternity, then we also have every right to deal with Eternity. If we are aware of our inner life, which is eternal, then there can be no tension. If we can't do something today, then we can do it tomorrow. Ours is not the eternal time of an idle fellow. We are seekers; we are praying, meditating and devoting our lives to God. We are doing our best. But we have to keep in mind that while we will do our very best, it is God who will fix the hour for us. This is the wise way to avoid tension. Every day we are doing our prayer and meditation, so now it is up to God to grant us realisation in His own way. Let God fix the hour for us. On our part, we shall do our very best every day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that you are in a running race. When it is over, you will offer the result to the Supreme. But in your case, when you have lost or done poorly, you suffer and you curse the Supreme. Right before the action takes place, it is easy to offer the action to the Supreme. But afterwards, you blame Him to whom you offered your most soulful surrender.</p>
<p>Again, when we win the race, when the result is most satisfactory, very often the result does not go to the Supreme; it goes to our pride and vanity. We say, "Because of my personal effort, I have achieved this victory. I have worked very hard. That is why I deserve it." Outwardly we say that the result must go to the Supreme, but inwardly we don't offer it.</p>
<p>We have to keep the attitude of surrender and it has to be a living attitude in our life, whether we win or lose. We may fail hundreds of times, but we will keep offering our failure to the Supreme. We shall offer the result either in the form of failure or success with the same cheerfulness. It is a very difficult task and a long process; but this is the only way we can be really happy.</p>
