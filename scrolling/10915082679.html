<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We start with the physical mind, which is the lowest mind. In the physical mind it is all obscurity, impurity, imperfection, bondage, ignorance and limitation. A little higher is the intellectual mind, which deals with abstractions and more sophisticated thoughts. Doubt, confusion and contradiction reign here. Next we come to the vacant mind. The essence of formless ideas can be perceived here. But thought cannot enter into existence in this mind. Therefore, it has no opportunity of being assimilated and transformed. Next is the calm mind. It is like an expanse of sea. Wrong thoughts can enter here, but they cannot grow in this calm mind. If bad thoughts enter, they are assimilated into good thoughts and divine willpower. Then comes the higher mind. In the higher mind thoughts are elevating, constructive, subtle and progressive. Next is the inner mind. In the inner mind the knowledge of creative thought and the wisdom of the inner light play together. Then there is the intuitive mind. The intuitive mind is the Vision-mind. From it we get dynamic and creative revelation, but not in the form of thoughts as we know them in the physical and intellectual minds. Then comes the overmind. Here duality starts, multiplicity starts. God is infinite forms in the overmind. Then comes the supermind, where creation starts. There is no multiplicity, no diversity here, but a flow of oneness. Everything in the supermind is one, whole, complete.</p>
<p>These are the aspects of the mind. All these levels of the mind have to surrender to the Will of the Supreme. Unfortunately, they do not surrender together. The gross physical mind cannot be one with the supermind, so they do not make their surrender together. It is not possible. Kindergarten students study according to their capacity, while college and university students study at a much higher level. Each level of mind has to surrender to the Supreme individually. They cannot do it simultaneously because their standard is totally different. But sooner or later all must surrender in order for God-realisation to take place.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can I do to make my aspiration stronger in the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can I do to make my aspiration stronger in the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only advice I can give you is this: if the mind is constantly involved in our aspiration, then we will not succeed. Suppose you have two brothers. One brother is sick all the time, and the other is always healthy. If you think of the sick brother all the time, then you will also feel sick. If you go to the hospital four or five times a day, you are bound to feel that you are also sick, even though the doctors may find nothing wrong with you. So if you spend most of your time with your sick brother — that is, the mind — then you will be affected. But if you spend most of your time with your strong brother, your healthy brother — the heart — then you will get strength from him. When you become strong by mixing with him, then you and your heart — the two healthy and strong brothers, can come to help the sick brother.</p>
<p>Always try to mix with those who are stronger than you. It is not that you should neglect or avoid the weak ones, but right now you are not strong enough to help them, and if you associate with them they will rob you of what little strength you have. Once you have gained the strength of the healthy heart, then you can go to the sick mind and make it well and strong.</p>

Can you comment on this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning many things may help us, but later they may become obstacles. Desire was a helper when it raised us out of the world of lethargy. But it became a hindrance when we wanted to enter into the world of spirituality. Developing the reasoning mind is necessary for those who do not have any brain at all, who will not be able to grasp any truth, who are little better than animals in their understanding. But once we have some mental capacity, we must begin to transcend our servitude to the mind by bringing down the Grace, Peace and Light from above to illumine the mind. We have to go farther, deeper and higher than the world of reason, far beyond the reasoning or intellectual mind. The reasoning mind has to be transformed into a dedicated instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>The reasoning mind is really an obstacle for an aspirant. Using the mind becomes a limitation because the mind cannot grasp the Infinite. If we live in the mind, we will constantly try to circumscribe the Truth; we will never be able to see the Truth in its proper form. Only if we live in the soul will we be able to embrace the Truth as a whole. Beyond reason is Truth. Beyond the boundaries of the reasoning mind are Truth, Reality and Infinity. Reason has very limited Light, whereas what we want and need has infinite Light. When infinite Light dawns, reason is broken into pieces.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to know if something is true without using the mind, then meditate on it. I am your spiritual Master and you are my disciple. If you want to make sure my decisions are right when I ask you to do something, instead of using your mind to challenge or contradict me, let your heart aspire. When the heart aspires, truth will automatically be revealed. Just do the thing that I have asked, and while doing it you will understand the reason why I asked you to do it.</p>

How can I contact the soul unless I use my mind to do so?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You <em>can</em> reach the soul, but not with your mind. The mind will never take you to the soul. The mind is a servant of the soul. When the soul says to the mind, "Come here!" the mind can come or it can run away. But the mind does not have the power to tell the soul, "Come here!"</p>
<p>The way to enter into the soul is with your aspiration. Once you enter into the spiritual life you can do very well without the mind. The mind will say, "If you do such and such, you are ruined." Just close your ears to this and say you do not want to hear any more. Within a few minutes you will feel something inside your heart telling you what to do. Whatever suggestion comes from the soul, just follow it. A day will come when all of the messages from the soul or the heart will come to the mind as well. The mind will eventually be illumined by the light of the heart, which comes from the soul. With the help of the heart you will be able to illumine the mind.</p>
<p>The mind says to you, "I am here to fulfil you." But the heart says, "Your mind is making you small, smaller, smallest; feeble, feebler, feeblest. Please try to go to the soul with your heart's aspiration. Then you will be able to illumine the mind most successfully." In the spiritual life the best thing to do is to forget the mind at first. Give all importance to the heart. When you receive the light of the heart, the light of the soul, then you can illumine the mind and go far beyond its limits.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: We are brought up in the West not to accept anything unless it has been proven. Should we have a mind that accepts things without questioning and without thinking?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: We are brought up in the West not to accept anything unless it has been proven. Should we have a mind that accepts things without questioning and without thinking?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you tell your son, "I am your father," why does he accept you as his father? Just because he believes you. When we come into the world, our very first step is belief. When a father says to this child, "This is fire, this is a knife. Do not touch them because they will hurt you," the child believes him. The father need not prove to the child that these things will hurt him. The child has no need to ask for proof. The simple faith that a child carries is the happiest thing. Arguments begin when his mind begins to develop. Then he may start doubting his very existence.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual life, faith is not mere belief. It is the oneness of truth. When you have faith, the Master does not have to prove anything, because you feel the essential truth of what he says, just as in the physical world you do not have to prove your existence to others because they themselves can see you and feel you. Their existence spontaneously becomes one with yours, and there is no necessity for any other proof. In the outer life you have to prove what you are saying. But in the field of consciousness, truth proves its own existence. In the outer life, truth does not prove its own existence. That is because we relate to the outer world with our outer senses. Therefore truth has to be proved by some kind of perception. But we also have inner senses. The mind has one foot in the inner world and one foot in the outer world. As an inner sense it is inadequate, and as an outer sense it is incompetent. So let us ignore the mind and deal with the soul. When we stay in the soul, truth's very existence is its own proof.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All right. But if you asked me to prove my capacity to swim, you would have to let me do it in my own way. If you asked me to prove my capacity with my hands tied behind my back and my feet tied together, I don't think I would be able to prove anything to you. Or if you refused to let me get into the water, or if you closed your eyes and refused to watch my performance, I don't think I could prove anything to you.</p>
<p>There is a way for a spiritual Master to prove the truth of his philosophy or of his realisation, but you must allow him to do it in his own way. I would ask you to give up your doubts, your impurities, your attachments, your desires for a few months, and meditate with me sincerely, devotedly and soulfully. If you allowed me to prove myself in this way, you would very soon see and feel the truth. But if you said, "No, I don't want you to prove yourself in that way; right now I want you to show me God, Truth and Light right before my very eyes," then what could I do? I would be helpless at that time. If I brought God, Truth and Light before you, which I could do, at that time your inner eyes would be tightly shut and you would not see anything, so you would still doubt my capacity and my truth.</p>
<p>In the outer world you need eyes to see if somebody is doing something. Similarly, in the inner world you need the third eye to see if somebody is doing something inwardly. One has to use one's inner vision to see the authenticity of the spiritual Master. The outer eyes, which serve the mind, are of no use for seeing inner things. If you want to prove the authenticity of a spiritual Master, meditate and go deep within, make your mind quiet and try to enter into the universal Consciousness. Only then will you see whether the spiritual man is telling the truth or not, only then do you become a competent judge.</p>
<p>But you cannot expect to become a qualified judge overnight. If you want to learn to be an electrician, you place yourself in the hands of a qualified electrician for a year or two and follow his instructions carefully. At the end of that time, if he has not taught you well, you can say, "You were not qualified," or "You did not know what you were doing." God-realisation is an infinitely more difficult subject. If a spiritual man says, "I can lead you to God," you have to follow his instructions to the letter for at least a year or two even to get preliminary experiences that will show you that you are on the right track. If you doubt him from the very beginning, you are not giving either yourself or him a chance. If your Master says, "I have seen the Light and I will take you to the Light," you have to give him an opportunity to take you to the Light. You have to be patient and you have to give him complete obedience. I use the word 'surrender', but complete obedience is necessary to make even a beginning. For that, one has to reject the doubting mind totally. With tremendous self-discipline you have to force yourself to stop doubting, even if you must tell yourself that it is only for a temporary period. Say, "I will stop doubting for two years and give this man a chance to show me the Light." But if you doubt his teachings while trying to learn from him, you are simply destroying your opportunities.</p>
<p>If you want to see something in the outer world, you have to go to the place where it is being shown. In the inner world it is also like that. When a spiritual person says that he is doing this or that, you have to go to <em>his</em> level, to <em>his</em> plane, in order to see it. Everything has to be seen or felt or judged in its own world. I am no judge of science because I have never entered into that world; I am not competent to judge it on its own level. Physical truth has to be seen in the physical world, and spiritual truth has to be seen in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Westerners have a special problem with this developed mind. It is really a disadvantage in the spiritual life to have a highly developed intellectual mind. But if you transform it and transmute it, it can become a very useful instrument. I wish to tell you a traditional Indian story on this subject.</p>
<p>A seeker who had studied thousands and thousand of spiritual books went to a Master and said, "Master, I have studied all that the books can teach, and now I wish to learn from you."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You are not fit to be my student."</p>
<p>The seeker asked, "How is it that I am not fit to be your student? Here you have all kinds of ignorant people as your students, while I have studied many books and all the scriptures."</p>
<p>The Master replied, "Because what you have learned, you now have to unlearn, whereas they have not to unlearn anything. You have a giant burden on your shoulders. Unless you unburden yourself, you will not learn anything from me. But these innocent students of mine are not burdened with book information; they are fresh."</p>
<p>Then the Master asked the seeker to bring him an almanac and open it to a particular page. "Here it is written that at this particular hour it will rain heavily. Now squeeze the paper. Is it raining here? Squeeze the whole book. Is it raining? You have squeezed the book as hard as you can, but no rain. Book-knowledge is theoretical knowledge. Experience alone is practical knowledge. Just unlearn all that you have learned for so many years, and then you will be fit to be my student."</p>
<p>Indian Masters are sometimes very, very strict, or perhaps we should say very rude, to their students when they come with intellectual questions. Sometimes they snub their students mercilessly. They want to show their students that unnecessary intellectualisation will only hinder their spiritual development.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have repeatedly said that if you live in the mind, no matter how many times you have seen Light or felt Truth, you will doubt and negate your experience. Since you have come to our path, I assure you, you have seen Light at least seventeen times. When you see it, the vision lasts for five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes. Then, on your way home you start arguing with yourself whether or not you have seen Light. Your mind starts fighting with your own achievement. But when you are meditating here, you do see Light and feel Light. I can say this on the strength of my own oneness with you. If you say I am wrong, I will say that you are wrong, because nobody on earth can deceive me. I can enter into you quicker than you can enter into yourself. I know that at least seventeen times you have seen Light and felt Truth. Unfortunately, when these experiences enter into your mind, your mind constantly argues and finds fault with your own achievements. It gets joy in suspecting your achievements.</p>
<p>Even those who have come into our spiritual path ten or fifteen days ago have seen Light and felt Truth inside their existence. Whoever has come to this Centre, whoever is connected with us, has already been blessed by the Supreme with His Light. Nobody has come or can come or will come to the Centre even once and not be blessed with this Light. Even an aspirant who has meditated at this Centre for the first time has already been blessed by the Supreme. It is the Blessing of the Supreme that has brought that aspirant here in the first place.</p>
<p>When some people see Light or feel Truth, owing to their ignorance they feel right from the beginning that they are seeing something wrong or something that is not genuine. Other people accept the experience of Light for a short while and do not doubt at all while they are experiencing it. Their doubt starts later, but when it starts it negates the experience for them. You belong to that category. When you see Light, at that time you do feel that it is Light you are seeing. When you feel the Truth, at that time you do believe it. But later, the hound of doubt devours your achievement and realisation. This is the favour your doubting mind is doing for you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us forget about the past; let us think of the present right now. What should you do when you study something? Instead of reading a page line by line and word by word, you have to look at the page all at once. Look at the page with your open eyes and do not read any word that is written there. Rather, try to bring the knowledge, the information, the wisdom that the page wants to offer, into your being, into your existence, into your heart. Once your heart has accepted this knowledge, it becomes natural to you and it will then be much easier for you to learn it with the mind.</p>
<p>When you study word by word or sentence by sentence with the mind, you will get information, but when you want to learn something permanently, you have to learn it with your heart. You have to open yourself like an empty vessel and allow the knowledge to enter into you and become part of you. The moment the heart accepts something, it feels that it is its own. When something is your very own you do not lose it because you give it due importance. But something you have borrowed from somebody else or from somewhere else, you will not be able to keep forever. When the mind gets something from the world, the mind feels it has brought in some foreign substance. Then a day comes when the mind discards it because it gets more joy in taking in new thoughts and ideas. The mind is like a grasping child; as soon as it gets a new toy it throws away its old toy because it feels that the new one is more beautiful. The heart also cries for new ideas, new knowledge, new wisdom, but it does not discard the things it has already achieved. To the heart, the things that it has already possessed and cherished and the things that it wants to cherish are equally important.</p>
<p>So when you read something or think of something, instead of using your mind to scrutinise it, or taking it idea by idea, try to make your heart an empty vessel. Look at the page as if you are going to devour it with your heart. The heart possesses things permanently; the mind possesses things for a moment and then throws them away and cries for something else. The mind is very limited, but the heart is the home of the Infinite. The whole world can stay inside our heart, but not inside our mind. Try to bring it into your heart and possess it there. Once the heart has possessed it you can never forget it. It is yours. What you have in your clean and orderly room you cannot lose, because at any moment you can look and see it there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of the subconscious is to disturb our inner peace, inner joy, inner light. We have to bring down Light and Purity from above into the subconscious plane to illumine it. Otherwise our subconscious and the unconscious parts always stand in the way of our spiritual achievement.</p>
<p>In the subconscious plane everything is chaotic, unillumined, unlit and fearful. It is important in the spiritual life to clear the jungle of the subconscious plane. But how can we do it? We can do it through constant aspiration and dedication to the Light that is ever descending from above. Each individual seeker has to illumine the darkness in his subconscious world, or the subconscious will continue to stand as an obstacle to his pursuit of God-realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The subconscious cannot be a direct entrance to the superconscious. One has to first become conscious. Then one has to go beyond the conscious mind through aspiration. From the subconscious region one cannot directly enter into the plane of intuition. It is not possible because intuition is a very high step in the spiritual evolution of the mind. The subconscious has to be purified. Only after it is purified can it take a form which can be held in the conscious mind. But even the conscious mind is not high enough to take us into the realm of intuition. The conscious mind itself is limited. I may be conscious of many things, but that does not mean that I have the power to go beyond the mind. But in the plane of intuition, everything is spontaneous, all-powerful, all-creative. This realm is far removed from the subconscious or even the conscious mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many things in our subconscious mind which need not and should not come to the surface. In the subconscious there is obscurity, there is impurity, there is negation. These things should be purified, transformed and perfected from within without being brought into the physical or conscious mind. It is better not to disturb the subconscious mind at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you are making a mistake. If you bring down the Light from above or bring forward your soul's light, automatically the subconscious will be illumined. At that time the subconscious will enter naturally into the conscious plane. But if you try to bring forward the subconscious without illumining it first, you will only create more problems for yourself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a spiritual method of self-analysis?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a spiritual method of self-analysis?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is not. The psychological kind of self-analysis, from the highest point of view, is wrong. In self-analysis we use the physical mind to try to examine our obscure past and our subconscious. In self-analysis we say, "I have done the right thing," or "I have done the wrong thing." There is always a positive and negative. But we have to go beyond positive and negative. In the Upanishads it is said that we have to accept ignorance and knowledge and then go beyond both to where all is divine wisdom. When we adopt self-analysis, one moment we are in knowledge and the next moment we are in ignorance. We are constantly identifying ourselves with knowledge or ignorance and with our mental doubt. But when we enter into deep spiritual meditation, when we are far along in the spiritual life, we are above ignorance and knowledge. We only cry for infinite Peace, infinite Light and infinite Bliss.</p>
<p>If the seeker is constantly examining himself with his mind, there will always be a strong pull from the negative forces in the mind. Like a magnet they will pull us, even though with our mind we are trying to discard whatever we think is wrong. The difficulty is that we do not use the soul's light to strengthen our willpower in self-analysis. When one means to do the right thing, that does not mean that he will be able to do it. The lower propensities and the wrong forces have tremendous power and this power comes in the form of temptation. If we give way to this temptation we are totally lost.</p>
<p>If a spiritual person wants to reach the realm of highest Peace and infinite Light, where there is no temptation, he has to go beyond mental analysis. He has to aspire. If, however, one has not accepted the spiritual life, it is better for that person to use self-analysis than to act like a wild animal. For him it is good, to some extent. If he does not use his power of self-analysis, for him there will be absolutely no difference between light and darkness. But if you want the quickest and most convincing way to transform your nature into a divine nature, you have to aspire. Aspiration is the only ultimate solution to the problems of human limitation.</p>
