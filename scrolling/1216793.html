<p>I didn't want anyone to meet me at the airport in North Carolina, so nobody was there. I got into a taxi and asked the driver to take me to my hotel. He said, "The hotel is so near. You should wait for the yellow bus. It will take you there for free."</p>
<p>I waited five minutes, but the bus didn't come. So again I asked the taxi driver to take me to my hotel. He said, "I will have to charge you five dollars, but the bus will take you free." He was so honest!</p>
<p>I said, "I will give you five dollars," and I got into the car.</p>
<p>Just then the yellow bus came. The taxi driver said, "Why don't you get out and take the bus?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, please take me to the hotel."</p>
<p>The hotel was not even five hundred metres away. The taxi made just two or three turns, and then we were there.</p>
<p>I gave him a ten dollar bill, and he gave me five dollars in return. I took the five dollars and got out of the cab.</p>
<p>As I was talking to a lady at the door of the hotel, the taxi driver started shouting at me: "You gave me two ten dollar bills by mistake." They were new bills, so they had stuck together. He was kind enough to return the extra ten dollar bill. Then I gave him the five dollar bill as a token of my appreciation.</p>
<p>This is how this taxi driver showed his gold heart.</p>

<p>When I went to see Connors play Nastase in the U.S. Open at the National Tennis Center, Databir and Ashrita had gotten me a very expensive ticket. The usher showed me to my seat, which was in the front row.</p>
<p>After some time the man sitting beside me said to me, "I am so and so. Would you please show me your ticket?"</p>
<p>I gave him my ticket. He began looking at it and scratching his head. It was definitely the correct ticket for that seat. He asked, "How could they put you here?" According to him, his party had the whole box.</p>
<p>Then, after five minutes, he again asked for my ticket. That time I said, "Please don't bother me anymore. You saw the usher put me here."</p>
<p>His friends also were annoyed with him. After that he didn't bother me anymore.</p>

<p>At the U.S. Open there was a man standing almost on top of me, blocking my view. All of a sodden Databir came up, shouting, "Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "What is Databir's mother doing here? Does she like tennis so much that she would come all the way from Connecticut?"</p>
<p>But Databir's mother wasn't there at all. Databir was just trying to get the man to move. By drawing his attention, Databir was able to move the man aside. Then the man went away.</p>

<p>Long live Vijali! She is the founder of three Centres — St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix. Altogether we have about fourteen or fifteen disciples there, and they all came to see me when I went to the Virgin Islands. About seventy or eighty seekers also came to see me.</p>
<p>Previously I had had a few very discouraging experiences in St. Thomas, but this time it was most encouraging. For seekers to meditate for thirty-five minutes in silence is a great achievement! I also played the esraj, and afterwards many, many soulful questions were asked.</p>
<p>After I had answered a few questions, a girl who was five or six years old said, "I have a question."</p>
<p>Everybody was amused. They wanted to hear what kind of question she had.</p>
<p>Then she said, "How do you know all that stuff?" Her question was shorter than the shortest, but it took me ten minutes to answer it. She was very moved.</p>
<p>Later, when I was about to leave in the car, she came up to me with folded hands to offer me some candy and asked, "Why do you have to go away today?" Afterwards I learned that her mother is a disciple.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Virgin Islands wrote me a very nice and gracious letter, starting with "Honourable Sri Chinmoy." In the letter be appreciated me deeply. He also sent an album with his autograph. He is a Puerto Rican, and I am sure that he knew of me.</p>
<p>His assistant — a tall, strong-looking man — read out the Governor's letter at the end of our public concert. The whole time he was reading, his entire body was shaking. Afterwards, he asked to have not one, but two or three photographs taken with me.</p>

<p>In November I went to Puerto Rico to participate in the Conference of the International Yoga Teachers' Association. There were quite a few swamis, spiritual Masters and seekers there.</p>
<p>While I was there, articles about me appeared in three Puerto Rican newspapers. <em>The San Juan</em> Star actually had two articles about me. They mentioned that I would be meditating and doing a few other things at the Conference on a particular day from eight o'clock to twelve. And they said anybody could come for free, since I never charge any fee. Unfortunately, the Conference Officials were actually charging ten dollars.</p>

<p>The day before I was scheduled to appear, the Conference authorities informed me that they could give me only two hours, instead of four. Instead of getting annoyed, I was delighted! I said to myself, "Why two hours? Why not one hour? The less time the better!"</p>
<p>I arrived at the Conference at ten o'clock. An Indian swami who was speaking before me went on and on about spirituality, while an interpreter translated into Spanish. So instead of starting at ten o'clock, I started at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>When I finally went to the stage, they read out a very long introduction about me. The lights were quite dim, so they asked me whether I needed better light. I said, "I don't want to meditate in the dark. Definitely I need better light."</p>
<p>I meditated for a short time, played the esraj and sang two or three songs. Then the Puerto Rican women disciples sang four or five songs, and Uttama did Hatha yoga for ten minutes to bring down cosmic energy. While Uttama was drawing cosmic energy onto the stage, I was meditating very powerfully. Master and disciple were bringing down cosmic energy together.</p>
<p>Around ten minutes to twelve, we finished our roles. The Conference organiser, who had been sitting in the front row, came up to the stage and bowed down in front of me with folded hands for about two minutes. Then she got inspired to start praising me to the skies. She said I was absolutely the greatest of all the spiritual Masters, not only for this era, but also for future generations. Like this she went on for five minutes. The swami who had spoken before me and so many other swamis were there while she was saying this.</p>
<p>Luckily, the audience was polite. Otherwise, the disciples of some of the other Masters might have caused trouble when they heard me getting such appreciation.</p>

<p>In the plane on the way home, the stewardess who was serving the first class section came to the economy section where I was sitting. I had finished my food and was writing poems. She noticed that I had not used the syrup that came with my French toast. It has millions of calories, so I didn't want to take it. She asked if she could give my syrup to somebody else. I said yes. I was very happy to give it away.</p>
<p>About 45 minutes later, while I was in deep meditation, the same stewardess came to me and asked, "Why do you keep writing 'God, God, God'?"</p>
<p>Do I write the word 'God' in all my poems? Perhaps only in one of the poems I had written the word 'God'. But she had seen it everywhere!</p>
<p>Then she asked me, "Did you come to Puerto Rico to attend the Conference?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I did." She said, "Which presentation did you like best?"</p>
<p>I said to her, "I didn't attend all the functions."</p>
<p>She said, "I was there on Thursday and Friday, but I couldn't come Saturday because of my work."</p>
<p>I said, "I was only there on Saturday."</p>
<p>Then she asked me who had participated on Saturday. I didn't know the names of any of the other participants, so finally I had to say that I was one of the performers, not one of the observers.</p>
<p>She asked, "Can you tell me your name?"</p>
<p>As soon as she heard 'Sri Chinmoy', she exclaimed, "Mira!" Then she sat down right in front of me, and for at least an hour and fifteen minutes she asked me questions. Sometimes she was on the seat and sometimes she was sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>She couldn't believe she was speaking to such a 'great man' and that I was answering question after question. At least two times her colleagues asked her to come and help them, but she wouldn't go.</p>

<p>The airline stewardess told me she was a staunch Catholic, but she asked me questions not only about Catholicism but also about Hinduism, Buddhism and other religions. She said, "You say the Buddha and the Christ are one. How is it that the Buddha was so strict and the Christ had so much more compassion?"</p>
<p>I said, "You were born into a Christian family. So why do you have to worry about the Buddha? The Buddha and the Christ are one. Let us say that you are both the Buddha and the Christ."</p>
<p>She couldn't believe my words. She said, "I am the Buddha and the Christ?" She looked to this side and that side as if to say, "How can I believe that?"</p>
<p>I said, "For me, let us say, you are the Buddha and the Christ. Now, suppose you have a younger sister who did something wrong, and you are displeased with her. If I happen to be there when you scold her, I will say that you are very strict.</p>
<p>"Then, let us say, a few moments later you see that same sister doing something good — something that gives you tremendous joy. At that time, you will show her such kindness and direction. Now, if somebody else happens to be there while you are showing her your affection, he will see only this side of you.</p>
<p>"So I saw your scolding face and somebody else saw your loving affection. But you are the same person. Perhaps you have read something about the Buddha when be was being strict with his disciples. But the same Buddha has shown such tolerance and compassion many, many times. Sometimes he shows his strictness and other times he shows love and affection to mankind."</p>

<p>She said, "See, I can't renounce. Your Hindu philosophy is renunciation."</p>
<p>I said, "I could have been wearing any colour, but you have asked me the significance of this particular colour."</p>
<p>She said, "But I can't renounce."</p>
<p>I said, "You don't have to renounce anything except things that are unnecessary in your life. If you need only one car and you have two, then get rid of the extra one. If you have four or five houses and you only need one, then keep just one."</p>
<p>She said, "I have a beautiful ring. It is certainly not necessary in my life. Do you think I have to renounce it?"</p>
<p>I said, "If you are attached to it, then renounce it. But if you are not attached to it, then you do not have to renounce it. Just tell me, do you feel a kind of vanity about it?" She said, "I do feel some vanity."</p>
<p>I said, "When you wear it, do you feel extra joy? Do you feel that you look more beautiful?"</p>
<p>She said, "That I can't say, but I feel happiness when I wear it."</p>
<p>I said, "All right, because of this ring God will not delay your God-realisation. But if you are deeply attached to your ring, then just discard it."</p>
<p>I was talking loudly, and the people beside me and behind me were all listening in awe. One man had been smiling at the beginning of our conversation. But after a while he started leaning forward so that he could hear everything. He was showing such respect for our marathon conversation.</p>
<p>Finally, this girl gave me her card and said, "You are a great man." She lives only five or six blocks from our Centre.</p>
<p>She was very simple, very soulful, very pure. Who knows, someday she may become my disciple. Then, the rest of her life she will be able to say that on the plane she had such a soulful and powerful talk with me.</p>

<p>The soul of Japan has come to me several times since we arrived in Japan. The first time was at the airport. The second time was in a furniture store, where Kirit was buying me a chair.</p>
<p>The third time the soul of Japan came to me was early yesterday morning. Since then, almost every morning I have had a wonderful talk with the soul of Japan. Yesterday it was all about Japanese political matters. The soul was advising me about Japanese politics. I said, "I am the right person to understand politics!"</p>

<p>Nakamura, the great Japanese running coach, has a big heart. He is like a grandfather. Anything that a grandfather says is philosophy. Whatever he says seems good. He says that Buddha's philosophy is the same as Krishna's philosophy.</p>
<p>His students have such faith in him and such admiration for him! They take him as a real friend, even a real father. Other university teachers often don't have any kind of oneness-feeling for their students. They teach what they want to teach, and the students learn what they want to learn. But Nakamura exercises his power of love, and his teaching success comes from his concern. It is not just strict military discipline. So his students really believe in him and believe that what he says is absolutely right.</p>

<p>After Nakamura came to our hotel in Tokyo to leave the gifts he had brought for us, I was talking with him on the way to the subway.</p>
<p>He wanted someone to take pictures of us. The one photographer who was with us had no more film left in his camera, but I said, "Just take it anyway!" So he just clicked the button and pretended to take our picture.</p>
<p>Before that, that photographer had taken seven or eight pictures of us. In one picture I was autographing something. In another, Nakamura was putting his hand on my chest after I had put my hand on his heart chakra.</p>
<p>My interview with Nakamura came out in a Japanese newspaper. It was a very significant interview.</p>
