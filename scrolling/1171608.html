SCA 1120-1121. Questions asked in Bukittinggi during the Christmas trip, January 1988.</p>
<h2>Question: At the start of the spiritual life, sometimes the Supreme will give the seeker a small experience of the goal, which gives the seeker inspiration. Then that vision becomes vague. Why is this?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is something called beginner's luck. All of a sudden you start playing a new game and you find that you are playing so well. Then for a few years you try to get back the same experience. You ask, "What should I do to recapture the same experience?" In this case, the answer is, "Practise the spiritual life."</p>
<p>God is so clever! He wants to create interest in us right from the start. If the seeker were not successful in his first attempts to meditate, he would say, "Oh, spirituality is not meant for me."</p>
<p>But if you have a good meditation, you will say, "Once I had such a nice meditation. Why did I get it? Did I practise spirituality at that time?"</p>
<p>Here God is showing us His unconditional Compassion. God is saying, "Let us go half-and-half. You aspire and I will show you my Compassion." If you give up, God will not be the loser. He showed you that it is possible to have that joy. So you have to continue, continue, if you really want God, if you really want to follow the spiritual life. Otherwise, if God gives you the experience a second time, you will not value it. Like a child playing with money, you will discard it. The parents are giving the child lots of money and he is only wasting it. Then he has to work very hard to get back the same amount.</p>
<p>God is not unkind. Only He is saying that in order to get joy from the spiritual life, how hard you have to pray, meditate and discipline yourself. You have an inner Goal. That Goal will not come to you and stand in front of you. You have to come to the Goal. The Goal says that it has to be won. If you really love God, then wherever He is, you have to run towards Him.</p>
<p>So do not be discouraged if you do not get the same high experience you got when you first started following the spiritual life. God took the trouble of coming to us. We must also take the trouble to go to Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we are conscious that we have failed repeatedly to achieve something, how can we still be happy and cheerful?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If we are conscious that we have failed repeatedly to achieve something, how can we still be happy and cheerful?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to meditate so that we can forget the past and have a new beginning. By repeating, "I am bad, I am a sinner," shall we become saints? No! Now you have to forget that once upon a time you were in a dark room. You have to enter into a room that is flooded with light because that room is filled with hope and joy. You have to go there and become a citizen of the inner world.</p>
<p>In your case, you fought very hard for six or seven years to overcome the wrong forces, but now you have surrendered to them. These forces are absolutely merciless. You have to forgive me, my compassion is speaking to you. Come out of the dark room. Enter into the room that has light. This applies not only to you, but to many people.</p>
<p>Let us say that each person has twenty subjects to study. Previously they used to do well in ten or fifteen subjects. Now the same people are doing well in only four courses. God-realisation is one subject, true, but inside that one subject there are little, little subjects. God-realisation is a most difficult subject. The others are not so difficult. But I see that people are failing in many subjects and then they become weak. So to everyone I am saying, forget that you were in a dark room. Do not continue to stay there. Just enter into the room that is full of light.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1122-1123. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Tenerife on 22 January 1992.</p>
<h2>Question: What is your opinion about the pollution of the environment?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very sad thing that nature is being destroyed, the environment is being destroyed. It is nature that keeps us beautiful and soulful. When nature is destroyed, when artificial things replace the natural beauty, it will ruin all the good qualities that human beings have. Unfortunately, people like artificial things, glamorous things. Many people do not like natural things which have their own beauty, purity and divinity. I feel very sad that the environment is being polluted and destroyed. I feel that we should pray that nature should remain natural. Beauty should remain always as it is so that we can derive from it our purest joy, purest love and purest oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: To what degree does the Oriental philosophy influence the West?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: To what degree does the Oriental philosophy influence the West?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Oriental philosophy is based on the inner reality, whereas the Western philosophy is based on the outer structure. The Oriental philosophy is like the seed and the Western philosophy is like the tree. The tree cannot be fruitful unless the seed is productive. Again, the soil has to be very fertile. So the seed has to be good and also the outer soil has to be very fertile. Eastern philosophy and Western philosophy must go together. The Eastern philosophy is inner poise and the Western philosophy is outer power. Inner poise and outer power must go together in order to be fulfilled.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1124-1129. These questions were asked at the San Francisco Centre, 25 November 1991.</p>
<h2>Question: What should we do if we find ourselves becoming bored when we sit down to meditate and also just in our day-to-day life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Use your imagination-power. Early in the morning, after you have meditated — not before your meditation — write down three absolutely new things that you have never done, you have never thought of. Then those three things will give you inspiration or a kind of challenge. It will create a sensation in your mind or in your being to do them. Meditate first. Many people do not meditate early in the morning, even though I have been begging and begging them. It is a very sad experience. So first things first. In the morning, meditate. After the meditation, use your imagination-power. Just write down, "Three things today I will try. I will make a fresh attempt."</p>
<p>I am not saying that you have to accomplish these things in one day, no. It may take a few days or even longer to accomplish them. But you can make a start. Life is not boring to one who believes in adventure. Adventure does not mean that you have to climb up the tallest mountain. To allow new ideas, fresh ideas, healthy ideas to enter into your mind — that is adventure. And then you can work on them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we get rid of insecurity totally, so that it never comes back?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we get rid of insecurity totally, so that it never comes back?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on faith, on belief. You have to believe in vastness, you have to have faith that the vastness is not going to destroy you. Look at a child's faith in his father. The child is not even two feet tall, but the father is six feet tall and very robust, stout. The child is not afraid when he goes near the father because the child has established his inseparable oneness with his father. He goes to the father happily. He knows that his father is not going to give him a slap. On the contrary, his father will only pour affection, love, concern and fondness into him.</p>
<p>In our case, we have not yet developed our oneness with vastness or infinity. We are insecure for two reasons: either we want to go ahead of someone and we do not feel that we have the necessary capacity, or we feel that we are inferior to so-and-so. Insecurity starts when we are trying to go ahead of somebody else or we feel that we are behind someone and the whole world is looking at us and we have no way to proceed. Why should we proceed? We have to feel that people who are going ahead of us are carrying us in the depths of their hearts.</p>
<p>If I am a little child, I feel that my father's heart is carrying me although I may be unable to walk side by side with him. So do not be afraid of the vastness or enormity; do not feel that somebody has more capacity than you do or somebody is greater, no. We have to feel our oneness with the mightier capacity of other individuals. That is the only way we can get rid of insecurity totally.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When the physical body is not in good condition, how can we still make the fastest progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When the physical body is not in good condition, how can we still make the fastest progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am the right person to answer your question! My physical body is suffering so much. There are many people who suffer physically but who make faster than the fastest progress. And again, there are many who are physically fit but who do not think of God, do not think of inner progress.</p>
<p>Many elderly men and women, unfortunately, are not physically fit. It is true that if you are physically fit, then you get joy, you get freshness, you get more inspiration to aspire. But if, for certain reasons, you are not physically fit, what can you do? At that time, there is only one way you can solve the problem. You have to offer gratitude to God because you are still cheerful, you are still happy, you have not revolted against God.</p>
<p>In your case, you can say, "Oh, I can still walk and come to the tennis ground and look at my Guru every day. Every morning I am the first person to look at my Guru when he arrives." This is how you are keeping yourself happy. And this happiness is helping you to make tremendous progress.</p>
<p>But if you think, "How unhappy I am! Look at the other disciples. How they are running, cleaning, moving around. Had I been like them, I would have made so much progress," that is not the right attitude. You do not realise that when you are walking with such difficulty, entering into the tennis ground, you are so happy that you are able to see me. You are thinking of me, praying to me and all kinds of things you are doing. But you do not know what is in the minds of the other disciples who are moving around. So many millions of problems they have. Your only problem is that you are unable to walk as fast as they do. Are you not lucky? Your only problem is that your pain is not allowing you to walk as fast as others do. But this is on the physical plane. On the mental plane, you have no idea how much other disciples may be suffering. "Guru is smiling at him because he has done something great, he has made an exercise machine; Guru is not smiling at me because I cannot make that kind of exercise machine." And so it goes on.</p>
<p>People who do not have the capacity sometimes are lucky because they can make surrender — let us not call it helpless surrender, because that is very bad, but cheerful surrender. You can say, "O God, You did not give me the capacity to do something, to perform something, but my gratitude-prayer to You is that whatever You have given me, I should be satisfied with."</p>
<p>So if you are satisfied with what you have, then you can make the fastest progress. There is another way you can be satisfied with what you have: just look around. You will see that there are many people who are suffering much more than you are. If you go to the hospital, you will see how many are in infinitely worse condition than you are. When you think of your suffering, think of the hospital. Then this thought will be your immediate medicine. That is what I do. Sometimes, when I can walk only with utmost difficulty, I think of some human beings who cannot walk, cannot move at all, and my suffering seems like nothing in comparison to theirs. At that time, I say to God, "O God, You are so kind to me. Still I can walk a little, whereas so many people in Your creation cannot walk at all."</p>
<p>Again, why should I have to make comparison with other people in order to make myself happy? That is only a temporary solution. The first way is by far the best way. You have to say to yourself, "I will remain happy. Who can be suffering more than God Himself inside me?"</p>
<p>We feel that God is all Happiness. But God is everything. God is not only inside our suffering, God is suffering itself. Let me just give an example. When a little two-year-old child has got some serious ailment and is suffering, the identification of the mother is such that she suffers far more than her little child. How much a mother can suffer! A mother's identification with her child goes to the very root of the child's suffering.</p>
<p>So here, also, if we take God as our Mother or Father, we have to feel that He is suffering much more than we are. We feel that we are the sufferers. But if we love God, we will feel that inside us Someone is not only suffering as much as we are, but He is suffering much more because He has the capacity to absorb, to receive, to feel everything more than we do. In that way, the Supreme suffers more than we can ever suffer.</p>
<p>Again, there is a purpose in our suffering. We do not know why. So our attitude should be only cheerful surrender to God's Will. You will definitely pray to God for better health — that is the right attitude. But, while praying to God for better health, you have to offer gratitude to God because you are still happy and you have not revolted against Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I just got a job two weeks ago working with the homeless people in Berkeley.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I just got a job two weeks ago working with the homeless people in Berkeley." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Such a big heart you have, such a magnanimous heart! I deeply appreciate the fact that you are serving the homeless. At the same time, you also have to feel that you are homeless. Your home is your soul. So, from the spiritual point of view, people who do not have a free access to their souls are homeless. You are taking care of the homeless because they are helpless, but then your soul feels, "Oh, my child is homeless, homeless." Your soul thinks of your mind, your vital and your body as homeless. In the same way that you are taking care of the homeless people on the physical plane, your soul takes care of you on the inner plane, the spiritual plane.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each individual should try to make friends. Boys, you should try to make friends with one or two newcomers, according to your nature. Girls, also, should do the same. If you feel a kind of affinity with some individuals, then try to mix with them. You will not lose anything. You can take it as a responsibility in your own inner life to take care of one or two people. Boys will do devoted service for the boys and girls for the girls.</p>
<p>And there should be more Joy Day types of activities. The newcomers should definitely come on your regular meditation day, but also two or three times a month try to have some recreational activities to make them feel that our way of life is not renunciation. From acceptance, we transcend the things that have to be transcended and illumined.</p>
<p>Some disciples feel that if they mix with the newcomers, they will lose their spirituality or divinity. Others become insecure. They feel that these newcomers are more talented than they are, so the best thing is to keep the newcomers beneath them by ignoring them.</p>
<p>That is not true at all. If you help someone to walk along the path of spirituality, God will give you the capacity to run faster, infinitely faster. And then, since you have been doing Yoga for so many years, you have to feel oneness if that person goes one step ahead of you. You will be so proud that it is you who have helped that particular person to go ahead.</p>
<p>Insecurity does not even need another individual. When your own heart is going ahead, your mind feels jealous. Your mind does not want your heart to go ahead. Your mind enters into your heart and creates confusion. It tells the heart that you are doing the wrong thing. Very cleverly it is jealous of the heart because everybody is appreciating the heart and they are not appreciating the mind. So the mind tells the heart, "You are doing everything wrong."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we have more heart-power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we have more heart-power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only by repeating, "I am the heart, I am the heart, I am not the mind." The qualities of heart-power are purity, beauty and the feeling of oneness. When we think of a temple, immediately we think of the shrine inside it. We think of the flowers, incense and so forth on the shrine. Otherwise, a temple is like another building. But when we say 'temple', immediately inside our body, inside our nerves, inside our being, we feel something pure. Something is elevating our consciousness. What is it? It is the candles, the incense and the flowers on the shrine. Anything that deals with purity we think of at that time.</p>
<p>In exactly the same way, when we think of heartpower, the most significant treasure that the heart has is purity. When you think of the mind, purity is not to be found there. At that time, you only think of confusion or supremacy: the mind is either thinking that you are useless, or that the rest of the world is jealous of you. There is nobody to feel or establish oneness with the mind. The good qualities of the mind are serenity, clarity and illumination. But these are rarely found.</p>
<p>So when you think of heart-power, the first thing you have to think of is purity-power. What gives us an immediate sense of purity? Any flower that you like best — a rose or lotus or some other flower. You have to feel that you are breathing in the beauty and fragrance of the flower that you like most. Please try to visualise it inside your heart. First feel that the flower is there. Imagine it inside your heart. Imagination has a reality of its own. As soon as you imagine that there is a flower inside you, a rose or any other flower, then try to smell the fragrance of that flower. Then, after fifteen minutes or half an hour or even a few days, try to feel that that flower has become invisible inside your heart. You do not have to see the flower as such, you do not have to smell the fragrance, no. As soon as you think of your heart, you will see that your heart has become the most beautiful flower, the most beautiful rose.</p>
<p>So in order to acquire heart-power or to be conscious of heart-power, we first have to develop purity-power. And inside purity is oneness. Purity accepts everybody. A child is pure; that is why a child accepts everyone. A flower is pure; it allows everyone to appreciate its beauty.</p>

<h2>Question: We learn about the Greek gods in school and I was wondering if they exist in some realm the way the Indian gods and goddesses do? And also I was wondering if new gods and goddesses are created or if there is only just one set of them.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us deal with the subject of Indian mythology and Greek mythology. My outer knowledge of Greek mythology is next to nothing. But Indian mythology I have studied and studied and studied. In my oneness-heart with God's infinite Wisdom-Light, I wish to say that the Greek gods and goddesses, unfortunately or fortunately, are no match for the Indian gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>Indian gods and goddesses came into being from the Supreme's supreme Height. The Supreme Himself wanted to create these cosmic gods and goddesses, in the same way that a tree needs branches, leaves, flowers and fruits.</p>
<p>Apart from our main cosmic gods and goddesses, for example, Maheswari, Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, there are many, many minor cosmic gods and goddesses whose names we may not know and perhaps do not need to know. A tree has countless leaves. If the owner of the tree wants to give a name to each leaf, he can, because he is at once omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. But for us to remember so many names will be impossible. We will become totally confused.</p>
<p>So, for our sake, we know that there are four cosmic goddesses whom I have just mentioned and, in addition to our trinity — Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva — we have Indra, Vayu, Agni and so forth. All of these Indian gods and goddesses have come right from the Supreme's Transcendental Vision. They are descended from the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>In the case of the Greek gods and goddesses, it is not like that. The consciousness of Greece and also the consciousness of the countries around Greece aspired and this aspiration ascended from the physical plane to the vital plane. The mental plane it did not reach so powerfully. This aspiration wanted to get something directly from Above. This aspiration was able to come up from the physical to the vital level, but from there it was unable to come up. But there was tremendous hunger to get power from Above. They cared mostly for power. Inside power, if there was light, wonderful, but they obeyed power more. Wisdom they did not care for. They wanted to separate wisdom from power. In their minds, the power aspect predominated. But it is not possible to separate them. Wisdom and power go together. While they were invoking power from Above, they were getting some wisdom as well.</p>
<p>So the Greek gods and goddesses are mostly formed from the aspiring vital, but we have to know that this vital is not the lower vital, or the lower elements, far from it. These are the dynamic, not aggressive, aspects of human aspiration. It went up and it went to the vital level — the vital that is dynamic, active and progressive.</p>
<p>At this point, the Supreme said, "My child, since you have taken so much labour to come up to this place, let Me come down and give you what you want." So the Supreme brought down His Grace. Here, the aspiration which reached up to the height of the vital world, received the Blessings from Above, from the Supreme, and then this sublime aspiration took the form of gods and goddesses, or the form that was made eventually by the human mind into beings, which came to be called gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>But I wish to tell you that the Indian gods and goddesses are infinitely more tangible. You can talk to them infinitely more affectionately and lovingly. Although goddesses like Kali and Durga have tremendous power, you can deal with them more intimately than with the Greek gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>To be very frank with you, the stature or height of the Greek gods and goddesses and the Indian gods and goddesses is not the same. It is like comparing a hillock and Mt. Everest. I am saying this from my own realisation. Others may realise the truth in a different way. There will be people who will refute what I am saying, they may not accept it at all, but each one has to be satisfied with his own realisation.</p>
<p>To come to your second question. We cannot say that new gods and goddesses are being created. I see clearly that the new ones are only the old ones being manifested in new forms, new ways and with new light. The Supreme is not bringing into the world new gods and goddesses because these gods and goddesses do not believe in evolution. They do not participate in God's Cosmic Game the way we participate in it. Their realisation, their capacity, everything, is fixed.</p>
<p>The cosmic gods and goddesses are like millionaires in terms of inner wealth, but they will remain millionaires. They are not going to become billionaires. Again, if they misuse their wealth, their power disappears. It is the same with human beings. If somebody has lots of wealth, we have to see whether he is misusing it or using it properly. If he uses it properly, he will get joy and gratitude from mankind.</p>
<p>But in the case of human beings, if they aspire only to become one with God's Will, to please God in God's own Way, then they will become the choicest instruments of God, the Supreme, and their earth-transformation-power will far exceed the powers of the cosmic gods and goddesses.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1131-1132. These questions were asked on 24 July 1980.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we prepare ourselves to be more receptive for our Wednesday night meditations?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to feel that every Wednesday night is a golden opportunity. Either you are going to miss that golden opportunity or you are going to avail yourself of it. Something most precious you will get or something most precious you are going to lose. Take it in that way. If you are wise, you will try your utmost to seize that opportunity. If you are a fool, you will neglect it and lose it.</p>
<p>For an hour or an hour and a half we meditate. Even for five minutes, if you can remain in your highest, you will receive something. You do not have to be receptive the rest of the time. You can receive a very large quantity in a small amount of time.</p>
<p>Always think that there is a place where you can get the most special thing. Now you have to value that special thing. The difficulty is that a rich man's children squander their father's wealth. The father does not mind, as long as they use it. But they misuse it; they waste it. Then the father says, "In time they will learn to use it." But some will continue to neglect it, in the sense that they will not pay any attention to it. They want their father's wealth, but they do not value it.</p>
<p>Money-power as such is not bad if it is used properly. Similarly, spiritual power must be used properly. But some people do not have a developed consciousness. That is why they misuse the inner wealth. What do they value? Their lethargy, idleness, ignorance.</p>
<p>Why do I love America? I always say that America is like a mad elephant going this side and that side, breaking heads, but at least it is trying to go forward. Instead, quite often it is going sideways. But the point is that if the elephant lies down and sleeps and snores, it is not going anywhere. It is better to make mistakes than to lie idle. Each time we make mistakes, we get a deplorable experience. Then we try once more to make progress. Again, we make mistakes. And again we feel that there is something higher and deeper. But if we do not value the spiritual wealth, then what do we do? We just sleep; we remain where we have always been.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, on Wednesday nights, before I come to the meeting, you can read some book and create a meditative consciousness. Very often before I come to the meetings the atmosphere is almost like an Indian marketplace. Everybody is talking and moving around. The disciples are like mischievous students. They are doing everything wrong but, as soon as the teacher comes, they fall silent.</p>
<p>If you go to the meeting before I arrive and remain peaceful, a peaceful atmosphere and consciousness will enter into those who are not disciplined. And if you can remain silent, I will be sincerely grateful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between your love and your concern?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between your love and your concern?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you love someone, you will have concern for them, but love is infinitely more important than concern. Love is oneness. Concern may not be based on oneness. If you have established oneness with humanity or higher realities, you will give everything that you have and everything that you are. But if you have concern for someone, you will give according to your willingness, not according to your capacity. If you love someone, you will give according to your total capacity. You will give all that you have and all that you are.</p>
<p>If you have concern, you can give just a little. A beggar is asking you for alms and you are giving the beggar a dollar or two. That is your concern for a poor man. You may think, "Perhaps he has not had a proper breakfast." But if you have love for that individual, immediately you will invite him to your place and give him the food that you like best, and let him eat as much as he wants.</p>
<p>So there is a great difference between love and concern. Love is total self-giving, but concern is giving only the amount that you want to give, whether it is one dollar or ten dollars. Concern is limited by your willingness to give, but when you have love for someone, then you give to that person boundlessly and endlessly, according to your own inner capacity. Love is conscious and constant unconditional self-giving. If it is unconditional, then only is it real love.</p>

<h2>Question: Are the souls of your songs different?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Like human beings, they are different in terms of development. Some songs are not as developed and powerful as other songs. There the inner divinity is not as manifested as it is in the case of, say, <em>Jiban debata</em>.</p>
