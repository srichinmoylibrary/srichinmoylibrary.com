<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who am I to pronounce judgement on the Christ? He is a Saviour in the purest sense of the term, not only of the West but of the whole world. He is one of the Saviours like Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, Sri Ramakrishna and others. They came into the world and they are still in the world, Our human eyes do not see them but our life of aspiration sees and feels them. They are the World Saviours who are trying to illumine the earth-consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the first step in pursuing peace of mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the first step in pursuing peace of mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In pursuing peace of mind, the first step is to sincerely feel that no individual is indispensable. If you feel that you are not indispensable to others and that others are not indispensable in your life, then you can easily have peace of mind. We lack peace of mind precisely because we feel that others need something from us or we need something from others. When the feeling that we or others are indispensable goes away, we get peace of mind.</p>
<p>An individual may have a few good qualities, but that doesn’t mean that he or she is indispensable. The same good qualities others may have. The more we give importance to ourselves or others, the more we weaken our own capacity. Only God is indispensable. We have to give all importance to the Source, to the Divine within us, to the Supreme within us. We have to feel that we are able to help or serve others, and they are able to help or serve us, precisely because the Supreme has given us certain qualities. These qualities have a true possessor, and the possessor is the Supreme. If we can consciously and continuously make ourselves feel that He alone is indispensable, then we can have peace of mind. This is the most effective way to bring about peace of mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Awareness of infinity a seeker develops only when he is on the verge of realisation. But infinity, as such, has its own awareness, its own universal awareness or transcendental awareness. Infinity has its own awareness, which the seeker gradually becomes one with in his inmost consciousness.</p>

They say I shouldn’t meditate and I say they should aspire more." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we aspire, we feel the necessity of Truth alone, Light alone, Divinity alone. We try to become God’s perfect instrument so that we can share His Light with the rest of mankind. So our main concern is to become perfect and for that we have to grow into something divine. If we really want to become good, divine and perfect, then we have to pay all attention to our own life first. We have to pray and meditate. We are not criticising society, we are not condemning others; only we are doing the thing that is of paramount importance in our own life. We won’t say that others are doing everything wrong, whereas we are doing the right thing. No. We will only say that our Hour has struck. Our Hour has struck, so we pray, we meditate. The Hour for others will strike today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>So instead of belittling others or finding fault with them, please feel that what you are doing is absolutely the best thing for you, according to your own understanding and receptivity, and what they are doing right now is right for them, at the present stage of their evolution. If you do your work and they do their work, and if you do not find fault with them and they do not find fault with you, then all of you can run the fastest. In that way, there will be no confusion, there will be no contradiction, there will be no problem at all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a difference between concentration and meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a difference between concentration and meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we concentrate, we focus all our energy, all our attention on one subject or object. We do not allow even an iota of thought to enter into our mind, because each thought is like a dark spot on the tablet of our heart. We usually try to concentrate on something very small: tiny, tinier, tiniest. But when we meditate, we meditate on something very vast. At that time we are deeply absorbed in the vastness of the reality. When we concentrate, we try to get the minute reality so that we can become part and parcel of that reality. Then, from there we grow into the vast. But when we meditate, right from the beginning we try to deal with the vastness itself.</p>
<p>Concentration paves the way for meditation by making the mind calm and quiet. Concentration won’t allow any thought, even an iota of thought, to enter into the mind. It is like a guard standing at the door who will not allow anybody to enter. This is concentration. But when we meditate, the mind is already calm and quiet. At that time, we can observe which thoughts are friends and which are enemies. If it is a good thought, a divine thought, a glowing, illumining and fulfilling thought, then we will allow it to enter, because this kind of thought is our real friend. But if fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, jealousy and all these ideas come, we don’t allow them in.</p>
<p>Concentration demands swiftness in the mind. The mind will run very fast to enter into the object or subject so that it can become part and parcel of its reality. At the same time, concentration demands alertness. The mind will not allow anything to enter into it. Concentration has to be practised before one practises meditation. It is like the first rung of a ladder. We have to step on the first rung in order to step on the second.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV — Two God-instruments</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV — Two God-instruments" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Two God-instruments</h2>

<p>Both the Master and the disciple are eternal students. The Master is like Socrates, for he is consciously aware that he is an eternal student, whereas the disciple does not know that he is an eternal student. The true Master is God. The spiritual Master is a conscious and dedicated servant of God, a conscious and dedicated student of God. The Master knows that there is a Source and he belongs to that Source; he is of the Source and he is for the Source. He is consciously aware of it. The disciple is, unfortunately, not aware of his oneness with the Source, But the disciple does not always remain unconscious. He, too, develops inner maturity and inner light. Then he feels, like his teacher, that he is also an eternal student.</p>
<p>The spiritual Master is not actually a teacher for his disciples; he is a private tutor. The teacher teaches and then he examines, but it is the student who has to pass the examination with his own effort. If the student does not do well, then he remains in ignorance. But a private tutor gives us special assistance so that we will not remain in ignorance. In the spiritual life, the private tutor is the Master. He helps us to face the ignorance-sea. He privately teaches us how to face the ignorance-sea and how to discover our soul’s reality. In every way he helps us in our self-discovery.</p>
<p>There are some seekers who, unfortunately, feel that the Master is God. But no human being can be God. The Master is not even the real father of the spiritual family. The real father is the Absolute Lord. The Master is only an elder child in the family and the disciples are the younger children. The father has taught the eldest son to teach those very things to the younger ones. The younger ones may not know that their real father is not the eldest brother, but someone else. But they eventually come to realise this. The role of the eldest brother is over only when he can soulfully, devotedly and successfully take the younger members of his family to his Father, who is also their Father.</p>
<p>The Master plays the role of realisation and the disciple plays the role of aspiration. But realisation and aspiration are inseparable. What we call aspiration is realisation on another plane of consciousness. Here on earth we call it aspiration, but that very thing is realisation on another plane. Similarly, what we call realisation on another plane, on this earth-plane we call aspiration. Realisation is nothing but a continuous act of ever-transcending aspiration and aspiration is nothing short of realisation — either partial realisation or ever-illumining, ever-glowing realisation. It entirely depends on the seeker’s standard, on his inner growth.</p>
<p>The disciple offers his aspiration to the Master. The Master offers realisation to the disciple. The Master offers to the disciple what he considers to be the best in his life of realisation. The disciple offers to the Master what he feels is the best in his life of aspiration. But the Master tells the disciple, “No, this is not your best. It is high time to get up, my child. Do not sleep any more. Do not wallow in the pleasures of ignorance. Awake, arise! Then the disciple gets up and enters into the life of dynamic spirituality. At that time, the Master tells him, “Please do not delay. Sit on my shoulder. I shall carry you the length and the breadth of the inner world.”</p>
<p>Spirituality is like a divine game. There are quite a few players and each player has a distinct role. The Master plays a significant role and the disciple plays a significant role. But on the highest plane it is the Real in us, the Supreme, who plays the role of the Master in one individual and the role of the disciple in another individual. He is the giver in the heart of the Master and He is the receiver in the life of the disciple.</p>
<p>The Master is the bridge, the connecting link between humanity’s aspiration and divinity’s realisation. He takes what humanity can offer to him for divinity — its soulful cry — and he carries down what divinity can offer to him for humanity — its illumining Smile. The Master is also a messenger. He carries humanity’s hope into the world of God’s Vision and he brings down divinity’s Promise into the human world, He climbs up to the highest with humanity’s hope and he climbs down to the lowest with divinity’s Promise. What for? For the earth-consciousness, for the transformation and perfection of humanity.</p>
<p>The Master is a servant. In the ordinary life, you need the assistance of the servant in order to see the boss. In the spiritual life also, if a seeker or a disciple pleases the Master, who is God’s servant, the servant will tell the Boss that there is someone waiting to see Him. It is the servant who opens the door and tells the real Boss, the Supreme, that somebody is looking for Him. The Master is the secretary. You approach the secretary if you want to make an appointment with the boss.</p>
<p>The role of the Master is to do dedicated service in the silence-life. It is in the life of inner silence that he most effectively works in and through his disciples. It is the silence-life, as a matter of fact, that he offers to his disciples. And it is their sound-life that the disciples offer to him. Silence-life is for realisation; sound-life is for manifestation. Both are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The Master is most sincere when he becomes part and parcel of humanity’s cry. When humanity is hungry for Peace, Light and Bliss, the Master, on the strength of his oneness, suffers from the same hunger. Like humanity, he also is pinched with an eternal thirst and hunger. But again, the same Master goes up high, higher, highest and becomes one with the Source of infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. There in Heaven he enjoys a feast, a sumptuous feast, and here on earth he is compelled to starve. But both he does devotedly and soulfully. His role in God’s cosmic Drama is to carry humanity’s cry into Heaven’s Delight and to bring down Heaven’s Delight into humanity’s cry.</p>
<p>In God’s Eye, both the Master and the disciple are of equal importance. God knows that His little child, who is known as a disciple, will not always remain young and helpless. He will also be endowed someday with boundless Peace, Light and Bliss. And also God knows that it is He who is playing the role of a little child in and through each disciple. It is He who wants His creation to remain ever new and fresh. Ever-transcending newness and freshness is the world-song in each individual and each creation of His. At the same time, He inspires us and makes us feel that He is the ever-transcending Truth which both the Master and the disciple must embody.</p>
<p>The Master and the disciple become one on the day the inner initiation takes place. Now, initiation can take place in various ways. It can be done in the traditional Indian way, by chanting a mantra and offering a few symbolic sacred items. In this way the disciple is given a sense of renunciation, which is of paramount importance in the spiritual life. Initiation can also take place through the eyes. The Master offers a portion of his soul’s light or a portion of his life-breath to the disciple through the eyes. This is how he accepts a disciple as his very own. Through the Master’s compassion-power the disciple brings to the fore from the inmost recesses of his heart peerless gratitude. When gratitude and compassion work together, initiation takes place. At that time the Master makes a solemn promise to the disciple: “My son, your ignorance of millennia is now in me. I shall illumine it, transform it and make it a perfect instrument of the Lord Supreme.” On the strength of the Master’s absolute oneness with the Supreme and with his disciple, the Master feels that all that he is, all that he was and all that he will be, the disciple himself is, in seed form.</p>
<p>In the course of time, the disciple, like his teacher, becomes fully aware of the undeniable truth that he is also an indispensable instrument of the Absolute Supreme. Then the disciple says to the Master, “Master, you are the body of eternal Truth and I am your limbs. You need me for your manifestation and I need you for my realisation. Let us function together, for it is so ordained. You will play the role of the Universal Consciousness, the transcendental Height, and I will play the role of your earth-manifestation instrument. Together we shall manifest and fulfil the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>The Master, while serving the disciple in silence, knows and feels that he is loving the Beloved Supreme inside the disciple. And there comes a time when he does not see his Beloved Supreme inside the disciple as a separate entity but he sees his Beloved Supreme inside the entire existence of his disciple. He sees the disciple as his Beloved Supreme. And there comes a time when the disciple does not see the Master as another human being but he sees the Master as totally one with his Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>There comes a time when the Absolute Supreme makes both the Master and the disciple feel that He needs them equally, for He embodies both Vision and Reality. His Vision-Light He has already offered to the Master and His Reality-Light is growing inside the disciple. Both His Vision and His Reality must work together in order to establish the world of perfection here on earth. The Master without the disciple is lame and the disciple without the Master is blind. But when they are together they are neither blind nor lame; they are perfect instruments of the Absolute Supreme manifesting the Supreme in His inimitable way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I wish to say that the Master and disciple are both God’s indispensable chosen instruments. They are indispensable precisely because they want to please the Absolute Supreme in His own way. If the Master wanted to please the Supreme in the Master’s own way, then the Master would not be indispensable. If the disciple wanted to please the Supreme in the disciple’s own way, then the disciple would not be indispensable at all. But when both the Master and the disciple cry and try, try and cry, to please and fulfil the Absolute in the way the Absolute wants to be pleased and fulfilled, then they are pure, perfect and conscious instruments of God.</p>

SPOP 22-32. Question and answers following the talk <em>Two God-Instruments</em>.</p>
<h2>Question: How do you meditate?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before you meditate, you should begin with concentration. In this way your meditation will be easier. Since you are a disciple of mine, you will get a picture of me in my highest Transcendental Consciousness. And then after a few months, if you stay in our Centre, I will give you a special pin to concentrate on. In our New York Centre and other Centres, all disciples without exception look at this pin and concentrate on it. When they concentrate on the pin, they feel that their whole inner attention is entering into my highest consciousness. All their attention is focused on my pin. They have just entered it and they are there, transfixed.</p>
<p>Then, after concentration, you will begin your meditation. This meditation I shall tell you about is only for the disciples; it is not for others. You will look at that pin and then do one of two things, whichever you feel is best. You are concentrating on this pin and you have become totally one with my consciousness. Now, as a disciple, you will try to enter into me totally, with your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. Your whole existence will enter into me, like a river entering into the sea. This is one way. Or you will make yourself totally empty and allow me to enter into you. These are the two ways. Suppose you are meditating today and you are not afraid of me. While you are looking at me, you enter into me. Tomorrow, if you are a little afraid, allow me to enter into you. Do whichever is easier for you. If you want to enter into me, you are most welcome. My heart’s door is wide open. But if you are afraid of entering into me, if you feel that you will be totally lost, then feel you will keep your heart’s door open and allow me to enter into you. At that time, whatever you need, I will bring to you. If you need joy, I will come into you with joy. If you need delight, I will come into you with delight. If you are not afraid of me, then enter into me. Once there you can drink Peace, Light and Bliss; you can swim in my inner ocean of Light and Delight. But if you are afraid of me, then I will come into you according to your receptivity. If you have kept your heart’s door open this much, I will be in it; if you have opened it <em>this</em> much, I will be in it. It is up to you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is meditation a dialogue between the mind of man and God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is meditation a dialogue between the mind of man and God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is a kind of dialogue, but the only thing is that this dialogue does not take place on the mental plane. In profound meditation, the Absolute Supreme tells the seeker what to do. But when it is prayer, the seeker asks the Supreme what he should do. When you pray soulfully, your aspiration goes up high, higher, highest and you ask the Supreme Father what He wants you to do. When you are meditating, you remain where you are but, like a magnet, you pull the Eternal Pilot, the Supreme, and He comes and tells you what He wants you to do.</p>
<p>So this dialogue goes on, but it is not on the mental plane. It is done on the inner plane, the soul’s plane; and this talk that we have, the conversation or communion, is done with the help of inner Light. The conversation goes on between the Light that you have and you are and the Light that the Eternal Pilot, the Supreme, has and is. It is a conversation, a communion of Light, inner Light. Each individual has inner Light and this inner Light is constantly trying to bring down the infinite Light from above. The infinite Light is the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Enlightenment is a matter of inner study. As you go to school to acquire mental knowledge, even so, when you study within yourself, you acquire inner knowledge; you get Peace, Light and Bliss. Inner study is called inner discipline. When we know how to discipline our lives, when we can establish a free access to the inner planes, we get Peace, Light, Bliss and other divine qualities in abundant measure. But we have to study. When we aspire for a better, higher and more illumining life, automatically we get it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When did you start meditating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When did you start meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I started when I was quite young. At the age of twelve I started meditating consciously. Before that, when I was six, I was meditating, but it was not so conscious. It was at the age of twelve that I consciously accepted the life of aspiration. I became very conscious of it from that age and from the age of seventeen my aspiration was extremely intense, dedicated and surrendered.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What were you doing just now when you looked at me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What were you doing just now when you looked at me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was bringing your soul forward. Your soul wants to come to the fore so it can manifest its divine qualities. Right now it is unable to manifest its divine qualities because you are not aspiring. When you pray and meditate, when you aspire, the soul comes to the fore and its divine qualities get an opportunity to be manifested on earth. Once the divine qualities of the soul are manifested, we get true satisfaction from life. When I was meditating on you and the other seekers here tonight, I was actually trying to bring the souls to the fore.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you tell that you are not just fooling yourself when you follow a spiritual life? How do you know if you are really making progress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you tell that you are not just fooling yourself when you follow a spiritual life? How do you know if you are really making progress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you enter into the spiritual life, there comes a time when your inner experiences will prove to you that you are not fooling yourself. Temptation-life will go away, deception-life will go away, insincerity will go away, impurity will go away, anxiety will go away, the life of doubt and self-doubt will go away. So when these things leave you — these friends or enemies or whatever you want to call them — then you will know whether you are fooling yourself or not.</p>
<p>If you see that these forces — fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, temptation and desire-life — are still within you, even though you pray to God, then naturally you are fooling yourself. But if you are living a life of aspiration and every day your desire is decreasing, your anxiety is decreasing, your worries and all other undivine things are leaving you, then naturally you know you are making progress. At that time, you will easily know whether you are fooling yourself or not.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can anyone attain this infinite Light?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can anyone attain this infinite Light?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all God’s children. God has created us precisely so He can give us what He has and what He is. But we need to have the inner hunger. He who is hungry will eventually be fed. But if one does not have any hunger, then he won’t eat. So who will go to feed him? When somebody is thirsty he looks around for water. If he is not thirsty, he remains where he is. In the spiritual life also, he who has an eternal, sincere thirst for Light, Truth and Bliss will eventually have his thirst quenched.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you bring down certain qualities such as Peace, Light, Bliss and Power, do you bring down certain measured amounts or do you just bring down until we stop receiving?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you bring down certain qualities such as Peace, Light, Bliss and Power, do you bring down certain measured amounts or do you just bring down until we stop receiving?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We don’t measure it in that way. It is like turning on the faucet; it comes in a very fast and endless flow. It is not that I bring down some large measured quantity and then you receive according to your capacity, no. It comes in profuse measure. Then, when I enter into an individual, he receives according to his receptivity. Sometimes the individual receives according to the collective aspiration of the group with which he is meditating. So one time the individual receives according to the power of his aspiration and receptivity; another time, in a collective way, Peace, Light and Bliss are received as a unit.</p>
<p>Very often we see that more Light, more Peace, can enter into the disciple if he has opened up his inner door. Then what happens? The Light and Peace do not go back; they enter and remain inside him. When I bring these things down, nothing goes back. You take as much as you can and the remainder stays with us in the atmosphere. This reminds me of an incident. The last time we went to Puerto Rico, as one of the disciples came out of her garage, she asked, “Guru, will you kindly close the garage door?” So I pulled the garage door down. She then said to me, “I was asking you to close my outer door, but I am praying to you to open my inner door.” The outer door is the door of the senses. The sooner the disciples can close the outer door — which creates fear, doubt and anxiety when it is open — the more quickly and easily they can open the inner door, through which we get Peace, Light, Bliss and Power. So I wish all of you to give your Guru the chance to close your outer door and open your inner door. If I can do it with your conscious approval, then I shall be most proud of you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What if a disciple loses desire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What if a disciple loses desire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is very good. If he loses desire, naturally he is ready for the spiritual life. But there are many people in Indian villages who get up every morning and go to the fields. They plow the fields, then go home and lead a most ordinary life. They are satisfied. They don’t increase their desires but they don’t have any higher aspiration either. They do not have as many desires as we cultured people have. They don’t dare to desire because they feel that it is useless; their desires won’t be fulfilled. So if you lose desire, it is very good in the spiritual life, but losing desire does not mean that you will aspire. Let us say I do not want to be a millionaire because I have failed in my attempt to become one. But that doesn’t mean that I am going to church and praying to God for Peace, Light and Bliss. I have lost my desire, true. But I have not aspired to pray to God to give me Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
