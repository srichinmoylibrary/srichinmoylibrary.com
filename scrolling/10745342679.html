  <h2 id="page-title">Is aspiration the ultimate goal?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Is aspiration the ultimate goal?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>For one individual, aspiration is the goal according to his vision or capacity or receptivity. He is absolutely right according to his own awareness, his soul’s present development. But another person who has gone beyond this level of development will say, "No, aspiration is not the end." The first person is correct, but the second person has gone far, far beyond that goal.</p>
<p>When a child looks at a ladder, if he can reach the first rung, it is enough for him. That is his goal. But an expert climber, an adult, will see that this is only the first step. Similarly, when it is a matter of the inner life, the spiritual life, experience and realisation can better be explained by a seeker of the ultimate Truth than by a philosopher.</p>
<p>Many so-called philosophers in India do not have the authority to express the inner truth. They do not know what inner truth is. Very often philosophers enter into a sad controversy. Then they go to spiritual Masters who have not studied even one philosophical book or even one spiritual book. The philosophers explain their ideas in the most complicated philosophical jargon, but a spiritual Master can answer everything in one or two words. Then the philosophers go home in peace.</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago two eminent philosophers had a great debate over consciousness and infinity. For hours and hours they argued. Then they went to a very great spiritual teacher. She had read practically nothing but through her spiritual illumination, her inner illumination, she shed light on the problem of these two philosophers. She summed up everything in just a few words and then they went home.</p>
<p>If you enter into the deeper philosophy, you get inner vision. Philosophy means <em>darshan</em> and <em>darshan</em> also means vision. If you go still deeper, you come into the life of yoga. In yoga, you have not to see consciousness as something apart from you; you get consciousness as your very own.</p>
<p>Our vision of the goal entirely depends on our level of consciousness. According to the understanding and vision of some people, aspiration is the goal. But according to our understanding, the Goal is far beyond that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Experience-fruits</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Experience-fruits" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Every seeker has to pay utmost attention to aspiration and not to experience. Experience comes from God. Aspiration comes from our inner existence. At every moment we have to feel the need for an inner urge to go forward, upward and inward. Experience is not enough to pull God to us and keep Him with us all the time. In the spiritual life we have to aspire. Then one day we will get inner experience on the strength of our aspiration. Intense aspiration is food for our inner being. Just as we do not eat delicious food every day, we do not have high experiences every day. But eventually the time comes when we can have these experiences whenever we meditate. When does that time come? When we are in a position to identify ourselves inseparably with the Cosmic Will. Right now we have a very limited will. But when we are in the Cosmic Will, the Universal Will, then at every moment Truth is glowing and blooming in us and around us.</p>
<p>So if we want constant experience, then we have to go deep within and become inseparably one with the Universal Will. This Universal Will can easily be possessed on the strength of our aspiration. When we offer our soul’s will to the Universal Will, the highest Truth will dawn within us. Daily we can offer our surrender to the Universal Will. Let us meditate daily and cry to the Highest with our gratitude, dedication and consecration. We should not cry for experience; we should cry only for God. When we offer our dedication to God, God can never be ungrateful. Let us take and take and take from God; on God’s part, He will always give and give and give. Right now, unfortunately, our receptivity is very limited. We receive very little of God’s omnipotent Grace and Bounty which He offers to us in abundant measure. So we have to try incessantly to increase our receptivity. Then every day we can have divine inner experiences.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Peace in God-hunger</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Peace in God-hunger" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If a man wants to have a divinised life, a life of inner and outer peace, then he has to have aspiration, constant aspiration. From constant aspiration he gets realisation. And when he gets realisation, he gets the promise of supreme divinisation and peace. As the inner mounting flame of aspiration gets the opportunity to reach up to the highest, the inner peace starts functioning most convincingly and powerfully. At that time the seeker can never be separated from peace. His entire existence, inner and outer, is flooded with peace. But in order to achieve this peace, one needs constant aspiration.</p>
<p>There are some seekers who are more advanced, while some are relatively unadvanced. There are some seekers who think of God twenty-four hours a day, while others have only a vague idea of God. But if we want to achieve infinite, eternal peace, then we have to make God a living reality in our day-to-day lives. We have to feel that God is of paramount importance. If we do not eat every day, we starve our body. Similarly, we have to feel that if we do not pray and meditate every day, then we are starving our spiritual body; we will become sick. If we do not pray and meditate in the inner life, we find it very difficult to discipline the outer life. Then naturally we will not be able to feel inner peace. It is only through aspiration that we can achieve abiding inner peace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">World aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="World aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In my travels to Europe I have been to many places, and I have noticed aspiration in all the places I have visited. In some places naturally I have observed more aspiration than in other places. Each place has aspiration. But when it is a matter of manifestation on the outer plane, at one place the inner message is properly received and at another place it is nowhere to be found. There are other differences as well. For example, in one city I have seen tremendous determination even in the people who are not aspiring, not spiritually conscious. There is tremendous determination on the physical plane and on the vital plane. In another city, in spite of aspiration on the inner plane, there is tremendous outer chaos, uneasiness, uncertainty. In some fortunate cities we can see that the people invoke light psychically, through the inner heart. There are other places that invoke spiritual light more through the mind than through the heart. They are invoking light, praying, meditating, but through the mind. Again, there are also places where the people invoke light through the aspiring and dynamic vital and the physical. But there are one or two places where there is tremendous turmoil and revolution on the outer plane. Aspiration is there, but on the outer plane there is tremendous confusion. So if you want to make a comparison, these are the kinds of differences. These differences we observe on the outer plane, but on the inner plane each country and each city is aspiring according to its capacity.</p>
<p>When it is a matter of aspiration, I definitely can say that the world is aspiring more and more. On the outer plane we see quarrelling, fighting and war, so we may think that the world is not progressing. But on the inner plane, since I last visited these places, I see that they now have more aspiration and more determination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The pilgrim seekers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The pilgrim seekers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Man’s union with God has been in existence from time immemorial. But man has unconsciously, or rather, consciously severed this oneness by embracing ignorance instead of God. God has granted man limited freedom. Even this very limited freedom man has misused. That is why he is not now in conscious, perfect union with God. But through aspiration he can re-establish his conscious, constant, natural and spontaneous union with God.</p>
<p>Some time ago I read a book in which an eminent psychologist said that one’s goal should be aspiration. But the Eastern thinkers, philosophers and spiritual Masters say that aspiration can never be the Goal. Through aspiration we reach the Goal, but aspiration is only the first rung of the spiritual ladder. First comes aspiration, then experience, then minor realisation, then full realisation, then transformation and divinisation and then finally manifestation. We have to know that there is a vast difference between aspiration and manifestation, which is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our spiritual journey, our goal is aspiration. When we are in the field of aspiration, we will have the power of revelation. When the mounting flame within us rises up to the highest, at that time we will have the eye of vision, the third eye. It will make us see our ultimate inner Goal.</p>
<p>God-realisation is the first Goal of the aspiring seeker. The achievement of this lofty Goal is a matter of one’s spiritual development. If one has been aspiring and meditating in previous lifetimes, then there is no reason why he cannot attain realisation in this life on the strength of his present aspiration. Since we are all progressing toward realisation, in one incarnation or another our realisation is bound to take place. Again, the actual hour entirely depends on our spiritual development.</p>
<p>Realisation and manifestation have to go together. We have to aspire first within ourselves. But at the same time let us try to feel that the world is inside us, not outside us. The world is the projection of our own life. If we feel that we have acquired peace, then gradually, gradually we shall see that the people around us are being inspired and influenced by our peace. First let us try to create our own world according to our own satisfaction. When we have created or achieved something divine within us, immediately it will try to reveal itself. When we have more capacity, naturally many more people will be inspired and influenced by it. So let us please try to create our own world within ourselves, a world of peace, a world of love. Then, automatically, while we are aspiring for the Highest, these divine qualities will reveal and manifest themselves to the world at large.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Grace</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Grace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before realisation we think that our personal effort, our aspiration alone is responsible for our spiritual progress. At that time there is no such thing as Grace for us. But after realisation we come to see that there is no such thing as aspiration. Our progress is all due to divine Grace.</p>
<p>In the ordinary human life there is no end to our desire. Today we want one car, tomorrow two cars, the day after tomorrow three cars: our desire goes on and on. In the world of aspiration and realisation there is also no end. From an iota of Peace, Light and Bliss, we try to get a large quantity, then an abundant measure, then an infinite measure. But we have to know who has inspired us to leave the world of desire and enter into the world of aspiration.</p>
<p>Among the members of my family, my friends and all the people in the whole world, why is it that only I am aspiring? Who inspired me? Who compelled me to aspire? It was the divine Grace of the Supreme that inspired me. How is it that my brother is not praying and meditating but I am crying to realise God? It is because the highest power, the divine Grace is operating in and through me. Aspiration I have because God gave it to me. It is all His Grace.</p>
<p>The sun is shining. It is up to us to open all the windows and all the doors in order to receive the light. Naturally, if we open up the doors and windows, then the sun will come in. Similarly, the divine Grace is constantly showering down from above. Let us try always to receive it with our heart’s door wide open.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Faith and aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faith and aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is a great difference between faith and aspiration. Faith is very common. We all have faith; faith begins in the physical world; every ordinary person has it. We have faith in our friends; we have faith in books; we have faith in a teacher — in his knowledge and in his ability to teach us correctly. We also have faith in God. But faith is passive, while aspiration is an active, dynamic force. We all have faith that we will eventually realise God, but faith alone will not bring us to our Goal. For that we must have aspiration. And for intense aspiration, we need a spiritual Master.</p>
<p>If I have a friend who is a good driver, then I have faith that he will take me to my destination. However, this faith will not enable me to drive as he does. But if I really aspire to learn to drive, then he will be able to teach me and someday I will also become a good driver. It is the same in the case of a spiritual Master. We may have faith in his realisation, but we must also aspire. We have to make the effort ourselves. Our aspiration must have a goal, the Goal of God-realisation. We must have a burning flame within. If we aspire, God’s Grace will descend upon us and carry us forward to our Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">How to cultivate aspiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="How to cultivate aspiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Please remember at every moment in your life that you have two things, only two things: desire and aspiration. You have tried to fulfil yourself through desire, but you have come to the conclusion that desire has failed you. That is why you want aspiration. Aspiration alone can give you realisation. Now, you have to feel what realisation is. Is it something only for you or is it for everyone? Is it only for your personal benefit or is it for everybody’s benefit? When you have the feeling that realisation is for everybody’s use, then you know that the results of your aspiration will be offered to humanity at large. When you feel that what you gain from your aspiration is for humanity at large, then your heart becomes wide and receptive. At that time you will be able to bring into your vessel abundant Love and Light from above and automatically your aspiration will increase.</p>
<p>Now there is another way to increase your aspiration in your day-to-day life. Please feel that in this world something or someone has to be your Dearest and that dearest person is God. Although you have the members of your family and your friends, you have to feel that only God is your Dearest. If everybody is taken away from your life, you will still be able to say that your Dearest has not been taken away from you. The moment your thoughts of God and your feeling for God are lacking, you have to feel that your Dearest is out of your life.</p>
<p>While you are pleasing God, if He asks you to please someone else, certainly you will do so. But at every moment make it a point to please God. When you are very sincere in your spiritual life, anything you do for God will give you constant joy. If you keep God as your best Friend, then your aspiration will increase.</p>

<p>In my animal life<br /> When I was at my zenith,<br /> I was the pride<br /> Of earth's destruction-power.</p>
<p>In my human life<br /> When I am at my zenith,<br /> I am the pride<br /> Of Heaven's aspiration-power.</p>
<p>In my divine life<br /> When I shall be at my zenith,<br /> I shall be the pride<br /> Of God's Perfection-Power.</p>

<p>The divine manifestation and our human aspiration have to go together. They are like two eyes. If one eye is functioning and the other eye is not functioning well, then we are half-blind. We have to use both eyes, aspiration and manifestation. Both are equally important; like day and night, one has to be followed by the other. This moment we need aspiration, the next moment, manifestation. Again, real aspiration itself is manifestation and real manifestation is aspiration. They are one and inseparable.</p>
<p>We can unite aspiration and manifestation in two ways. While we are praying and meditating, we have to feel that we are manifesting; and while we are doing selfless service we have to feel that this is also real meditation. It is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Each year we can increase our aspiration and accomplish something very significant to offer at the Feet of the Supreme. Let us not repeat the mistakes that we have committed this year in the coming year. The good, divine things that we have done, let us try to repeat and multiply. There are innumerable good things we can do for the Supreme. These good things will automatically come to the fore if we are really sincere in our aspiration and in our cry for divine manifestation. Each month, each day, each minute is most significant. It is up to us to use our time either in a divine way or in an undivine way. If we don’t use our time wisely, if we just wait to see what is going to happen in our life, in others’ lives or in the rest of God’s creation, then merely watching with a curious eye is equivalent to doing something undivine. So the best thing for us is to do the divine thing all the time through aspiration and manifestation. While we are going up we are spreading our light. What else is manifestation if not this? And while we are doing dedicated service, immediately like a magnet something from above is pulling us up: that is our mounting aspiration. So in this way we see that manifestation and aspiration have to go together; they are inseparably one.</p>

<p>Dear seekers, dear brothers and sisters, I wish to give a talk on aspiration. In the spiritual life, there is nothing more important than aspiration. Aspiration is our inner cry for the highest Absolute. Aspiration is the eternal road. Aspiration is the eternal guide. Aspiration is the transcendental Goal.</p>
<p>A man of aspiration knows that what he has is human knowledge. Human knowledge is limited or unlimited ignorance. Aspiration is divine knowledge. Aspiration knows what binds us and what liberates us. What binds us is ignorance-night; what liberates us is wisdom-light.</p>
<p>Aspiration does not and cannot learn anything from or with the physical mind. Aspiration learns everything through the heart, through the heart’s perfection. Aspiration is not head-learning; aspiration is heart-becoming. Head-learning doubts. Doubt is slow poison in our spiritual system. It obliterates our purity, our serenity, our reality and our profundity. Heart-becoming is founded upon our faith, our self-giving and our feeling of universal oneness. Heart-becoming accepts. In acceptance looms large the message of total satisfaction, for through acceptance we eventually transform imperfection into perfect Perfection. First we see and accept a thing which is undivine. Then, on the strength of our inner light, we give it a new life. Finally we make it supremely divine.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the acceptance of life and the transcendence of death. Aspiration is the transformation and transcendence of the death-force. Through our aspiration we try to establish a free access to the immortal life so that here on earth we can establish the Kingdom of Heaven. This Kingdom need not and cannot remain eternally imaginary. It must be established in our life of aspiration.</p>
<p>When we go deep within, we discover that aspiration is the very Breath of God, which we utilise for our own sake. Again, aspiration is the death of the ignorance of millennia. When ignorance comes to an end in a seeker, God claims that particular seeker as His chosen instrument and God manifests Himself here on earth through that seeker.</p>
<p>There are two worlds on earth: the world of desire and the world of aspiration. In the world of desire, frustration looms large and the animal life reigns supreme. In the world of aspiration, our satisfaction-flower blossoms petal by petal. In the world of aspiration, the seeker’s dream is transformed into supreme Reality. The seeker comes to realise that God is man yet unmanifested and that man is God yet unrealised. Man’s realisation and God’s manifestation take place when the seeker’s entire being becomes all receptivity to God’s ceaseless flow of Compassion and Light. On God’s behalf, aspiration prepares our inner being. And on our behalf, aspiration welcomes and receives God. Aspiration welcomes the divine in us and fulfils the human in us. Man and God need each other equally and sempiternally. Man needs God to realise his transcendental Reality. God needs man to manifest Himself totally, integrally and universally on earth.</p>
<p>Aspiration expedites man’s journey toward the transcendental Goal and accelerates God’s manifestation here on earth. The seeker can expedite God’s choice Hour, providing his aspiration flame every day climbs up high, higher, highest. Today, on the strength of his aspiration-flame, he reaches the Highest. Tomorrow he comes down to reveal the highest transcendental Reality in the heart of aspiring humanity.</p>
<p>Aspiration houses the outer world and the inner world, the world of realisation and the world of manifestation, the world of ego and the universe of universal oneness.</p>
<p>With aspiration we begin our journey, and with aspiration we continue our journey. Since there is no end to our journey, and since God is infinite, eternal and immortal, our aspiration will constantly flow toward God’s Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. There is no end to our journey. Aspiration is the endless road that leads eternally toward the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>

<p>When I aspire<br /> God honours me.<br /> He tells the world<br /> That I am His fond child,<br /> I am His choice instrument.</p>
<p>When I do not aspire<br /> He also honours me.<br /> He tells the world<br /> That I am His future Choice,<br /> I am His future Voice,<br /> I shall embody His future Race,<br /> I shall reveal His future Face.</p>
