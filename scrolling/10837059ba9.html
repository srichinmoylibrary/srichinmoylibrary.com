<h2>Remark at Carnegie Hall</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy made the following remarks to his disciples a few days prior to their April 13, 1976 performance of his music at Carnegie Hall.</em></p>
<p>When you wear a sari, immediately your divine qualities increase like anything. And the boys must wear dhotis. This kind of dress brings forward real spirituality. It will really add to your consciousness. We are trying to show our family at its best and our background is spirituality. These pieces of music are all my Indian tunes, Indian flow. If you wear saris and dhotis, it will definitely, definitely add to the music. But if you wear a tie and Western clothes while playing Indian music, it will look very odd. While playing Indian music in the haunting Indian way, if you wear Western clothes, it will really detract from the soulful qualities. So kindly try to have as much of the Indian way as possible. I am not converting you people; far from it. But if you see anything good in me, if you see any good quality in some aspect of my life, it is not wrong to accept it.</p>
<p>Previously, the girls used to get a mark of twenty or thirty from me for serenity, purity and inner beauty. Now, when they wear saris, those girls are getting seventy-five or eighty; some get even ninety or one hundred. These material garments are just Indian saris, but they are divine. Sometimes, when you wear a particular costume or dress, certain spiritual qualities come forward. Each garment has a vibration of its own. Each colour represents some quality of your soul. From within, the divine qualities have to come forward. Again, if there is any special way we can encourage the divine qualities by using outer means, we shall do it. We have to be very clever. Anything that adds to our aspiration we shall do. We do it just because it is adding to our spirituality, to our reality, and not because it is an Indian custom or an African custom. I know that wearing saris adds to the girls' spiritual dignity, spiritual height, serenity, purity.</p>
<p><em>For the conclusion of his Carnegie Hall concert, Sri Chinmoy asked has disciple musicians to each play a different one of his musical compositions — simultaneously. These pieces were all slow, and all were composed in the same key. In these extemporaneous remarks about a week prior to the concert, Sri Chinmoy briefly discusses this.</em></p>
<p>Here we see divine soldiers with dynamic spirit. You are enjoying full freedom, but still there is unity and uniformity. Nobody is misusing this freedom. Inside the freedom there is unity. The freedom is full, but you are maintaining a kind of unity and uniformity along with the freedom.</p>
<p>What we are hearing is not actually harmony; it is Indian subtlety. Each instrument, each note, has its soft, sweet, delicate touch. All the slow movements of the various groups are going together and creating one slow, haunting movement. Here, if a fast movement comes, even if it is my music, I will not appreciate it; it will ruin the quality.</p>
<p>Western harmony I don't like in some cases. I will not be so prejudiced to say I don't like it at all; far from it. But in a few cases, I feel and I see that it really ruins the music. Somebody wants to go really soulfully towards the goal and somebody else starts adding a few things which are irrelevant. The first one is desperately trying to reach the goal, but he sees a few irrelevant things standing in his way. In our case, also, the music will be ruined if we have harmony and fast movement. We cannot imitate Western harmony. But in our finale, it is not actually harmony; all the groups are playing basically the same type of haunting melody. That is why I am encouraging it. This is something new and I am always after the new. I have no idea whether others will say that our ensemble destroys the beauty of the tunes. I feel that it brings to the fore their dauntless, heroic quality. At the same time, a real bond of oneness I am seeing and feeling. I am very happy and proud of our wonderful family. We have really good musicians.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Spiritual singing</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Spiritual singing" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>After singing a number of spiritual songs on 18 September 1970, Sri Chinmoy made the following extemporaneous remarks.</em></p>
<p>In each song I have sung, I have tried to identify myself with the song with utmost concern. The words I have tried to convey through my voice. There are many, many, many, many, many singers who have extraordinary voices and singing ability. I am no match for them. I have heard many singers of that type, but they don't feel the living breath of the words when they sing. Their beautiful, melodious voice carries the tune, but the depth and real significance of the words, we don't get from their voice. In my case, musical talent, voice, everything is unbearable; but when it is a matter of expressing the thoughts, of showing the inner significance of the ideas, I wish to say that in almost all of the songs I have been successful. There are three or four songs I ought to have sung better out of this group of fifty. But as far as the inner concern, inner depth, inner identification with the ideas and the thoughts, I have really done justice to these songs. Perhaps on some rare occasions I have made mistakes, but the sincere seekers of the Truth will forgive my so-called mistakes, even if they are grave mistakes. If they identified with me, if they identified with my aspiring soul rather than my singing voice, then they would have gotten considerable benefit.</p>
<p>So my request to you people, when you sing, is to sing soulfully. Even if you don't know a particular Bengali word, no harm. Still, you have to sing soulfully. You will say, "I don't know this word." But even when you sing an English song, very often you don't sing the words with any real feeling. When you sing, try to embody the significance of each word. If you can do this, then you will become the song itself. Otherwise, you will be a singer and your song will be something other than yourself. But the song and the singer must be inseparable. When a singer sings spiritual songs, if he lives the song that he sings, then God will be a living Reality at every second. Otherwise, God will remain in the infinite blue sky and the singer will have to remain down on earth. Then there will be a yawning gulf between God's Feet and the singer's head.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, we are trying to raise our head to the point where God's Feet will come and touch it. Our head and God's Feet must be together. Our head means what? Our head means our song. And God's Feet means God the Singer. So when the Supreme Singer sees that a song is aspiring to the Highest, then He feels His fulfilment in His creation. And what is the creation? The creation is the unfoldment of the Singer Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Singing the Invocation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Singing the Invocation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy gave the following extemporaneous talk on 22 March 1975 during a bus trip to Boston with a group of disciples.</em></p>
<p>I wish all of you to sing the Invocation every day. Feel that it is part of your meditation. More than that, feel that it is the most soulful meditation. When you sing, please try to imagine the words right in front of you with your mental vision. Sing most soulfully. I tell you with utmost sincerity, if you can sing the Invocation most soulfully, it will be as good as meditating for four hours most powerfully.</p>
<p>And also, when you sing my Bengali songs, please feel that you are praying and meditating. Out of a hundred songs, perhaps one or two are not spiritual; the rest of the songs are all spiritual. So when you sing soulfully, you have to know that you are praying and meditating most intensely. Indian mantras have tremendous power, and my songs, if you sing them soulfully, will have the same effect. It is not only mantras but also soulful songs that can elevate your consciousness and be like the best meditation.</p>
<p>Soulful singing is of paramount importance on our path. I have written hundreds of songs. Out of those, each disciple should select ten songs and sing at least two or three of them daily. If you can identify yourself with the music, with the message and the life and the realisation of these songs, then, I tell you, you will do the best form of meditation. Those who do not have the capacity to sing should listen to my records. These are my most sincere requests to all, all of you.</p>
<p>When you sing any song, try to identify yourself with my height. When you sing the most favourite song, 'Ore Mor Kheya,' which stood first among the disciples, please try immediately to identify yourself with each line: "O my Boat, O my Boatman..." It is difficult to identify yourself with the Supreme; you don't know whether He is tall or short. But easily you can identify yourself with me. Just see one step ahead of you a boat, a very beautiful boat. The boatman is also there, with the message of delight. The boatman is always bringing you nearer to the shore. Try to visualise and identify yourself with that reality.</p>
<p>When you meditate, most of the time you become victim to silly thoughts-undivine, unaspiring thoughts. But when there is music, automatically there is a soothing vibration, and you feel inside you a fulfilling joy. So to all of you I am saying, please give more importance to music. You have twenty-four hours a day at your disposal. If you can sing soulfully or listen to my music soulfully, then that will be your best form of meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A talk to musician disciples</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A talk to musician disciples" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Many of you in the Centre are musicians. I am begging all of you to stop playing vital music. If you play soulful music, the music of the soul, it will elevate the consciousness of humanity; it will illumine and immortalise and fulfil humanity. You are most talented musicians. This kind of music all of you can produce. When you play exciting, stimulating music, the music of the lower vital, not only does it do terrible harm to humanity, but it also does unimaginable harm to your own spiritual life, to your own reality-existence. This vital music will never, never, never elevate or illumine humanity. No, it will only create more problems for humanity. When you play this kind of music, the lower forces of the vital all come and dance, and then the reality in you and in others is destroyed.</p>
<p>This kind of music can be heard any place, in any restaurant or club. I am begging all the disciples to give something new to the world. Don't be a carbon copy of others. Do not give the world this kind of music which everybody knows, which everybody has heard. It will never add to your real sincere aspiration. Give something new; give the world music that comes directly from your soul, music that will help humanity raise its consciousness. Not the things that have been known for many, many years, but the things that people have never seen or felt or heard: this is what our disciples must do.</p>
<p>I always say that the past is dust. This vital music has aggravated, you can say, instigated or stimulated the consciousness of humanity. It has played its role, especially in the Western hemisphere. But this kind of music is not the soul's music; it can never, never, never be the music of the soul. The soul's music is something totally different. And the world will appreciate, admire, adore that music. But the world has not yet been blessed with this music.</p>
<p>To all my music-lovers, I am making my soulful request. What I am saying is a real blessing to you, to your aspiration, to your soul. Music is of God and for God, not of the vital world and for the vital world. Real music, divine music, takes you back to God, the Supreme Musician. Divine music is of the heart and for the heart, and never for the vital. If it is for the vital world, then those who play will have to live in that world. But you want to live all the time in the soul's world. So your music has to be totally, totally, totally different. You have to give the world the reality that you live. Even if the world does not right now appreciate it, still you have to remain faithful to your reality. If you are not playing the music that you live, the music that you are, then, I tell you, you will feel sorry. It is like living a double life. Your outer life must add to your inner life. Anything you do in the outer life has to be a proper expression of your inner life. If there is a yawning gulf between your inner life and your outer life, then you can never be happy. Here you are crying to realise God, and you will realise God sooner than at once on the strength of your inner cry. If you are crying to see God's Light in your consciousness, then you have to give the world what you really are. This music that you have been playing is not yours; it is something borrowed from the music world. If you bring to the fore music from the soul, the music of the dearest Beloved Supreme, then only will your contribution to mankind be significant.</p>
<p>Once, for two hours, somebody spoke to Vivekananda about a special subject. It was all quotations from this man and that man. Then Vivekananda said, "I am so happy to hear this, but now tell me something of your own." You have not come here to imitate others' achievements. Others may appreciate vital music and perhaps you also appreciated it at one time in your evolution. Ten years ago, let us say, you appreciated this music. That was good. But now, after ten years, the time has come for you to appreciate something infinitely higher, something more meaningful and fruitful.</p>
<p>In the outer world, you say, you have to play undivine music. But you know whether you are actually compelled or whether you really like it. You are in no way compelled. Just to attract the attention of the world, you will let your spiritual life suffer. What I am saying applies to all music-lovers. Really follow the spiritual life. Try to bring the soul's music to the fore. If you don't remain at your own level, then it will be a kind of hypocrisy. All my musicians have to forgive me today. Again, some of you have to play music which cannot be totally spiritual because of your job. Some of you have to play to meet with your earthly expenses, for your livelihood. Necessity knows no law. But I don't want anybody else to play this kind of music except the professional musicians. Eventually, I wish all those who have to have a musical profession to create something new. X also has to try something new. This is my simple, sincere request to him and to our great Y. also. Y's star is now on the ascendant. Now is the time for him to raise up the musical standard with a new light, not the light of the past. Z's music I have heard many times when he was playing with his orchestra. Sometimes it is really divine. I don't have to worry about him at all.</p>
<p>You are really talented musicians. Dear ones, from each of you I would like to have the soul's music. Each one will create a new world of music. I want each of you to become a pioneer musician of the music world. The past is dust, absolutely dust. From now on, please give something new from your soul. If you can remain in the soul, the music of the soul is bound to come to the fore. The soul has abundant light, boundless light, infinite light. Just bring it to the fore and the Supreme will be extremely proud of you; for you will bring Him to the world in a new light, and your music will be a new, triumphant achievement and glory.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Fragments from a conversation with Devadip</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Fragments from a conversation with Devadip" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>On 27 December 1975, at a spiritual retreat in Puerto Rico, Sri Chinmoy discussed music with his devoted disciples, Devadip Carlos Santana and Tom Coster, a member of Devadip's band. Earlier in the day, the band had given a concert in San Juan. Following are portions of Sri Chinmoy's remarks:</em></p>
<p>Music is an indispensable thing. We don't have to know what it looks like or what it does. Its very existence keeps us alive. Music means Self-expansion and oneness. The Self expands through music. The Self that expands is not the individual self but the unlimited Self. Music is the expansion of unlimited Reality. When the Unlimited expands, that is music.</p>
<p>Music is God's Dream. God is dreaming at every moment through music. His Dream is called the cosmic Reality, the universal Reality. If we don't dream, reality cannot come into existence. Reality is always there inside dream. So you can say that this moment reality is the body and dream is the heart, and the next moment reality is the heart and dream is the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you play, on the strength of your heart's oneness with the audience, do you observe one thing? There are two hearts: one heart is your small heart, which is playing, and the other heart is the big heart, which is listening. Again, the big heart is playing and the small heart is listening. It is like this. The audience is the larger heart and you are the smaller heart that is expanding and becoming one with the larger heart. When you are playing, at that time do you feel this? And then, do you feel that you are the larger heart and that the audience is the smaller heart? If you do have this experience, then you will feel that you were one and now you have just become many, and that you were many and now you have just become one. This is what happens when the smaller heart and the larger heart meet together. The smaller heart is the seed and the larger heart is the tree. The seed grows into the tree and the tree gives birth to new seeds. If you can see it this way, then at every moment your musicwill give the greatest satisfaction; for this moment you are the seed, the next moment you are the fruit. You are the fruit, you are the seed; you are the dream, you are the reality. This is what the heart feels.</p>
<p>This is the experience I had when you were playing today. When I identified with the musician, the smaller heart, sometimes I was seeing you as the seed and sometimes as the fruit. It is absolutely true. The seed and the fruit, the smaller and the bigger — you have to take them as one. Or, when it is small, take it as one, and when it is large, take it as many. On the strength of our oneness we see the seed and the fruit as the one and many.</p>
<p>The musician and the audience are like lotus petals. All around they are blossoming, blossoming, blossoming. Sometimes you see the lotus petal after it is fully blossomed and it is inside another petal. You have played your role, you have blossomed; and inside the blossom is a new creation, another lotus petal that has blossomed. At that time, your whole existence is perfection. There is no end to our perfection. But when we come to realise that perfection is not only inside us but also inside our creation, at that time we feel that a whole new world of perfection is dawning.</p>
<p>Each time we play music, in the beginning the music is the creation and afterwards it becomes the creator. At first it is the creation, but once it is well-established it becomes the creator. Why? Because new light, new life, enters into the creation itself and energy, reality, divinity start functioning inside the creation. At that time, the creation becomes the creator. It is like children. In the beginning, they are lifeless; we don't expect anything from them. We just give and give. But when they grow up, they start giving joy and satisfaction to the parents. They add to the parents and become creators. God created; He made you. Then you get satisfaction by becoming more than the creation, by becoming a creator yourself and offering something to the world.</p>
<p>Then, when you play music, please feel that it is not you who is playing. Somebody else is playing and somebody else is enjoying. But that somebody else is part of you. One part of you is playing, one part is enjoying and still another part has become the music itself. So the moment you start playing, make yourself into three parts. Feel that one existence of yours is playing, another portion is observing and a third part of you is the music itself. You are the creator, you are the creation and you are the reality that exists in the creator and the creation. These things need not come as mental thoughts or images; far from it. At a glance they can come.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you were playing I was clearly seeing a boat. When you were playing very fast, it was like inclement weather. The boat was not going to capsize, but it was rocking. You were playing very, very fast on the outer plane, and on the inner plane the boat was sailing very fast. It was not my mental hallucination. It was absolutely true. I had no idea what kind of music you were playing. The mind did not know, but the inner message or inner experience that I was getting was absolutely real. Again, when the music went very high, sometimes I saw a very high mountain. Once I was seeing you on top of a high mountain. At that time the music was not very loud, but I was seeing a mountain. You were all there on the mountain. Like that, at least twenty different images I saw at different times while you were playing. I may have been writing notes to Bansidhar or talking to Dhruva, but in my vision I was seeing this because of my identification with you. While the music was playing, I was watching.</p>
<p>The way to get such experiences is through meditation. When you meditate soulfully, early in the morning, you enter into a higher world, the world of divine reality, perfection and satisfaction. Then you bring this world down into your music. You do it this way. While you are breathing in and breathing out, try to feel that you are offering your life-breath to the instrument keys that you will use. Your life-breath is something very precious, and you are offering your life's most precious thing to your instrument.</p>
<p>When the Supreme created you, He gave you a portion of His Reality, His Divinity. That was the supreme sacrifice. He gave something of Himself and created you. And now, you are creating something for the world. You are giving to your instrument something of yourself — something really precious and luminous, something which is part and parcel of your own reality. You are the instrument of the Supreme. He is using you and you are using something else, your own instrument. It takes only a few seconds. You don't have to go to all the strings. Just cast a glance at one or two keys and feel your life-breath inside. Please, at that time, offer your gratitude to the Supreme. It was He who gave you life itself and a portion of your life you are giving to your instrument. The Creator created you by offering you a portion of His Reality. Now He is asking you to create something in the same way.</p>
<p>There is something called the cosmic sound. We call it <em>Anahata Nada,</em> the soundless sound. This is the word that we use, but that word is an infinite understatement. The cosmic sound is infinitely more powerful than the loudest sound that we can produce; yet it is inaudible to the ordinary ears. If we hear the soundless sound inside our heart, it is infinitely more powerful than the loudest sound we can produce. You will use the word dynamic. But I wish to say that in softness there can be the greatest dynamism. Sometimes I talk to the disciples in a fatherly way, with utmost concern and affection. I am talking in a very soft, delicate voice, but at that time I am holding my absolutely most dynamic power. I am smiling at the disciples and offering them all kinds of affection, so they think, "Guru is all affection, like a tiny feather that will be blown away by the wind." But in my softness there is divine volcanic power. Again, when I am shouting, barking, scolding, insulting, at that time there is absolutely no strength there. I am shouting, but I know that when it is a matter of solid strength, strength that can build or break, then there is nothing so powerless as my shouting.</p>
<p>As a musician, when you want to offer something to the audience, if you all the time use outer means, you will not be able to give satisfaction. You say that here in Puerto Rico they always eat beans and rice, and that is all that they like. But I wish to say that the world is always looking for the new, the new. God Himself is looking for the new. I have written thousands of poems with no rhyme or metre. But why should poetry all the time have metre and rhyme? People will say, "It is very easy without rhyme or metre." But I do not see eye to eye with them. With God's Grace, in my poetry I entered into another world, a world of oneness. So something new, something divine has to come out of it. Let us call it a new river flowing from the source. This new river is flowing and we have to become one with the flow. Something new is coming out which offers progress to mankind, and if we become one with it, then we can really offer something to humanity.</p>
<p>If one is a great runner and people have seen him win all the time, then people will expect him always to increase his speed. But there comes a time, no matter how fast one runs, when people will not be satisfied with him because the thing that he has created or offered as a runner is not enough either for him or for the audience. But if the same runner enters into the long jump or javelin, then he is all the time creating newness. If a musician all the time performs loud music, then he is acting like a runner, the best runner. The audience has got from him inspiration, joy and aspiration as a runner. But now the audience expects something new from him in the same field of sports. If he can become a good shotput thrower or discus thrower, then immediately he creates a new road for the audience to travel.</p>
<p>Each time you play, you create a road for the music-lover to walk along. One particular road he may like today, but tomorrow he may not like it. You will say, "What is wrong?" Nothing is wrong. But human beings always want to change. They are not satisfied with one thing; they will be satisfied only with four things or six things. So, when your music changes form every now and then, it is a great boon for mankind.</p>
<p>I am telling you some tricks of mine. As you know, I never play any piece without making mistakes, but sometimes when I strike a wrong note, inside the wrong note I do something. I use my concentrative power to give my voice or music a sweetness, and that power enters into the audience. I am hearing the unsatisfactory notes, but the audience is hearing the sweetness, the subtle, delicate qualities. Sometimes their minds may know that I hit the wrong note, but inside that note they get tremendous joy: something new, something sweet. I have done this many times with my disciples. I also do it when my voice is not good. In your case, when you know you are playing correctly, but you are not getting the same sweetness or height, at that time do you become sad or depressed? Or do you put your concentrative power inside the so-called lesser music to immediately produce new life? You are not trying to fool the audience; far from it! Only you want to give new life to the lesser music and maintain the same height, the same creation. Here you are creating something else, giving something new to the audience, so that they are delighted.</p>
<p>The best thing would be for you to write a book. People may not accept it overnight. But in ten years or twenty years they will see that what you are saying is all reality, all truth. You don't have to prove what you are saying; your proof is your music. If you stick to your own principles, you don't have to prove anything. The very fact that you are continuing to play is your proof.</p>
