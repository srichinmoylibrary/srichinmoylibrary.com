  <h2 id="page-title">Ilvala the demon</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ilvala the demon" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Agastya was living in a cottage in the forest. The particular place where Agastya lived was full of demons, or raksasas. These raksasas used to terrorise all the people in that forest, but they did not dare to attack Agastya because he was so powerful.</p>
<p>There was a particular raksasa, Ilvala, who was especially fearsome, and everybody in the forest was frightened to death of him. Ilvala had a younger brother, Vatapi, who had the ability to change himself into a ram. People would then unwittingly take him for sacrifice. After killing the ram, they would cook it and offer it as food to their family, guests and themselves. When the meal was over, Ilvala used to summon his brother with his occult power. As soon as he called, Vatapi would burst forth from the stomachs of all the people who had eaten the ram, and thus they were killed. Then Vatapi became a ram again.</p>
<p>This went on for quite a few years. A large number of people were killed in this way, but nobody could do anything about it.</p>
<p>Once the two brothers tried this trick on Agastya and Agastya ate the ram. But when Ilvala cried to Vatapi to come forth, Agastya just laughed and laughed. He said in a thunderous laughter, "Where is your brother now, Ilvala? I have digested him. He is all gone. I have digested him very nicely so you can't have him. And you have to remain my slave for the rest of your life. If you resist, I will destroy you with my occult power."</p>
<p>Ilvala said, "O sage, O sage, do not destroy me. I shall be your slave. I shall eternally remain your slave. I will do everything possible and impossible for you. Only do not destroy me. I know you can easily destroy me. I am at your feet. Give me protection. Show your compassion to me. This is what I need, although I do not deserve it. I am sure you will grant it, for you are not only the most powerful, but also the most benevolent sage. Forgive me. Forgive me."</p>
<p>Agastya said, "I am forgiving you. Remain my slave, and from now on try to become spiritual and divine."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Balarama and the apple orchard</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Balarama and the apple orchard" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Krishna was very dark, but his brother, Balarama, was light-complexioned. Some Puranas are of the opinion that Balarama was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, while others believe that he was the incarnation of the cosmic serpent, Shesha. Again, still others feel that he was the incarnation of Lakshmana, Sri Ramachandra's younger brother.</p>
<p>Balarama and Krishna were always adventurous. In their boyhood, both brothers were extremely, extremely fond of each other. Krishna always enjoyed doing mischievous pranks, but Balarama was not inclined that way. Still, he used to love Krishna for his cute mischief.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when they were in their teens, they were passing an orchard, when they saw some apples. Naturally they picked some and ate them, as is quite natural for young boys to do.</p>
<p>The orchard was owned by a demon named Dhenuka. Dhenuka was an admirer of Kangsa, the hostile force incarnate, who was ruling the kingdom at that time. Dhenuka hated Krishna and Balarama. Since he had the capacity to take the form of an ass, he immediately did so and started kicking the two boys very hard. But Balarama and Krishna ate to their heart's content, not paying any attention to the ass.</p>
<p>When they had eaten as much as they wanted, Balarama said, "Now that we have eaten your apples, we are strong; so we are ready to fight with you." Then he caught the ass by its heels and whirled him around his head until the ass died. Then Balarama flung its carcass onto a nearby palm tree. Many came to see the deplorable incident and they also fought with Balarama and Krishna. But alas, it was all in vain. They too met with the same fate, and the palm tree was soon festooned with the carcasses of asses.</p>
<p>Children often do a little mischief. If older ones punish them beyond their due, this is what happens. Children have strength indomitable and the older ones, because of their lack of wisdom, suffer what they rightfully deserve. But if they forgive the children when they do something wrong, or if they illumine them, then all the catastrophes and hurtful incidents that children can create for grownups can easily be avoided.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Balarama conquers Pralamba</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Balarama conquers Pralamba" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once there was an athletic competition that many athletes participated in. Kangsa, the hostile force incarnate, sent the asura Pralamba to join in the competition against Krishna and Balarama. Kangsa told Pralamba, "Please defeat these two brothers. If you can defeat them, I shall gladly and unreservedly give you anything that you want. I would hate to see them become victorious. You must defeat them."</p>
<p>Pralamba said, "Do not worry, my Lord. I shall defeat them badly. I give you my word of honour."</p>
<p>Kangsa said, "Nothing will please me more. If you defeat them, you will offer me a world of happiness. Certainly you can and you will."</p>
<p>"I can and I will," said the demon Pralamba.</p>
<p>The athletic competition commenced, and everyone was showing their prowess. It was said that the winner of each event would be carried on the shoulders of the loser. Pralamba deliberately lost in one of the games so he would get the chance to carry Balarama on his back. When Balarama got on his back, the demon suddenly expanded his form, becoming very huge, and he ran away with Balarama.</p>
<p>Krishna was surprised and shocked. He cried out, "What are you doing? What are you doing?" Krishna was about to fight Pralamba, but instead he said to Balarama, "Brother, Brother, bring your immortal nature to the fore. Why are you allowing yourself to be carried away? If you do not listen to my request, I shall have to fight this demon and kill him."</p>
<p>Balarama laughed and laughed. "Krishna, my brother, you know who I am. Why are you worrying? Let him carry me as far as he wants to."</p>
<p>Krishna said, "No, no. I do not want him to carry you any further. Please, please use your powers and destroy this demon. Otherwise, I shall."</p>
<p>Balarama gave a hearty laugh, summoned his divine strength and became infinitely, infinitely more powerful than the demon, squeezing Pralamba to death.</p>
<p>Balarama was strength incarnate and indomitable courage incarnate. When necessity demanded, he acted. But he never misused his strength, never!</p>

<p>Balarama had many, many good qualities: kindness, compassion, affection, love, forgiveness and so forth. But he also had one bad quality. He enjoyed drinking wine profusely. Then, when he was in a state of intoxication, he did not know what was going on and he was not fully conscious of outer happenings.</p>
<p>Once, after drinking wine, he asked the river Yamuna to come to him so that he could bathe. Yamuna laughed and laughed, "Look at the audacity of this mortal. How dare he summon me! I shall not go."</p>
<p>Balarama waited and waited. Then he became furious and said, "Yamuna, you are not coming to me? Then I shall punish you badly." He took his primary weapon, the ploughshare, into the river and dragged all of Yamuna's water out of the river.</p>
<p>Yamuna was shocked; he never thought that a human being could do this. He begged for forgiveness. "I will never, never disobey you. I will always listen to your command. Please give me back my water," he pleaded.</p>
<p>Balarama returned the river's water.</p>
<p>Yamuna said, "Balarama, you are not only powerful, but also merciful. If you had not forgiven me, I would have remained empty, totally empty. I admire your power. I worship your forgiveness."</p>

<p>Eternally mischievous, the Kauravas once got an opportunity to imprison Krishna's son, Shamba.</p>
<p>Krishna sent some of his representatives to arrange for Shamba's release, but they came back saying, "They refuse to reason. They will not let Shamba go."</p>
<p>Balarama, Krishna's brother, became furious that his nephew was imprisoned. Balarama went to Asanapada, the Kaurava palace, and thrust his ploughshare under its ramparts. Then he said to Duryodhana, the chief Kaurava, "If you do not surrender Shamba now, I will destroy this palace!"</p>
<p>Duryodhana knew Balarama's strength and immediately surrendered Shamba. "We know you are all strength. Again, you are all forgiveness. We have committed an unpardonable crime. Now we realise it and we are releasing Krishna's son. Forgive us, Balarama."</p>
<p>Balarama said, "Do not act like a fool. Your power is nothing but the exhilaration of your stupidity. Whom are you challenging? Krishna? He is the Lord Himself! Whom are you challenging? Me? I am the one who holds measureless strength. O mortals, never dare to create anger either in my brother Krishna or in me, for immediate death will come and shake hands with you. Be careful!"</p>

<p>There was a great man whose name was Divida. Once upon a time he was nice to Balarama. But alas, it is difficult to always remain a kind, good and nice human being, and slowly he developed arrogance and tyrannous qualities. He did many, many undivine things, and people could not bear his arrogance or his tyranny.</p>
<p>The worst incident occurred when he was tempted to steal Balarama's ploughshare. He entered into Balarama's house in the middle of the night and stole the ploughshare.</p>
<p>When Balarama discovered his loss, he challenged Divida to mortal combat, in a few seconds cutting off the thief's head.</p>
<p>He told Divida's friends and others, "Never, never dare to steal my main instrument, the ploughshare. That is my life-breath. If you create any problems for me, ignorance will befriend you. I do not want ignorance to befriend you. When you allow ignorance to befriend you, eventually death comes to befriend you. So be wise. Don't try to make a fool of me and don't try to make a fool of my brother, Krishna. Do not make a fool of anyone, or eventually yours shall be the unimaginable punishment!"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Balarama marries</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Balarama marries" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In those days it was socially acceptable and almost customary for people to marry more than one wife. Sri Krishna was married more than twice. But his brother, Balarama, married only once. He married a most beautiful girl named Revati.</p>
<p>Raivata, Revati's father, at first did not want his beautiful daughter to marry Balarama because he was so short, whereas she was so tall. He also thought that it was beneath his dignity to offer his daughter to Balarama.</p>
<p>But Brahma knew that Balarama loved Revati dearly, even before his marriage. He told Raivata, "If you do not please Balarama when he asks for your daughter, and if you do not give her to him, then you will be sent to death immediately. So be wise. I am not asking because of his power, but because he is very kind-hearted. He is not only great and powerful, but also kind and good. He is the right person."</p>
<p>So, at Brahma's advice, Raivata went to Balarama and begged him to marry his daughter. Balarama smiled and agreed, saying, "You are fulfilling my heart's desire."</p>
<p>On the wedding day Balarama was shocked to see his wife's height. He told Revati, "What will people think of me if I marry you? You are so tall. Let me shorten you. I assure you, it will not harm you. With my divine ploughshare I shall shorten you and you will not be affected."</p>
<p>So he shortened his wife and they became the same height.</p>
