<p>Most of the stories in this and other books in this series are Sri Chinmoy's retelling of traditional Indian tales. On rare occasions the Master has modified a story to make it more acceptable to the Western palate. And a few of the stories are Sri Chinmoy's own.</p>
<p>These tales are not only delicious and nourishing, but also encouraging and illumining. Some are quite entertaining. Others are surcharged with morality-flames and spirituality-fire, which easily enlighten the Western mind, strengthen the vital and quicken the journey of the body-consciousness. Together they represent two trees standing side by side: entertainment-tree and enlightenment-tree. Both trees are at your disposal. Appreciate their flowers and fruits to your heart's content.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Ashwatthwama surrenders his crown</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ashwatthwama surrenders his crown" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the battle of Kurukshetra, the Pandavas and Kauravas had a rule that they would fight only during the day. Unfortunately, one night the Kauravas broke this rule. After the death of his father Dronacharya, Ashwatthwama entered into the tent of the Pandavas and killed the five sons of Draupadi.</p>
<p>When Draupadi found that her sons had been killed, she cried and cried bitterly. She told Bhima, "Bhima, I am not going to eat anymore until you kill Ashwatthwama and bring his crown to me. If you cannot do this, then I will starve. I will sit here and do nothing until you do my bidding."</p>
<p>Bhima ran out to kill Ashwatthwama, with Yudhishthira and Arjuna following closely. They heard that Ashwatthwama was hiding on the bank of the Ganges, pretending to meditate amongst the sages there. He had taken the disguise of a sage and sat near Vyasa.</p>
<p>With great difficulty Bhima, Arjuna and Yudhishthira found him. As they approached, Ashwatthwama took out his most dangerous arrow, the Brahmashira. Arjuna also had this same arrow. Before Ashwatthwama and Arjuna began battle with these dangerous arrows, the great sages Narada and Vyasa, as well as many others, stood up and said, "Stop! Stop! Withdraw those arrows! Otherwise, thousands of people will be killed! You can't do that. You must have some compassion for innocent mankind."</p>
<p>Arjuna said, "I am ready to withdraw, because I don't want to kill unnecessarily, especially not innocent people."</p>
<p>Ashwatthwama said, "I will also withdraw."</p>
<p>Arjuna was able to withdraw his arrow because of his spirituality. He had practised spirituality for so many years and had become good in hundreds of ways.</p>
<p>But Ashwatthwama could not withdraw his arrow and it killed Arjuna's grandson. Every one cried. They were in a sea of tears.</p>
<p>But Sri Krishna smiled and, with his yogic power, revived Arjuna's grandson.</p>
<p>Bhima had not forgotten Draupadi's request and said, "You are the loser. Arjuna defeated you by bringing back his arrow. You are now at our mercy. Give us your crown. If you do not do this, we shall kill you here and now."</p>
<p>Poor Ashwatthwama, what could he do? So he gave his crown to Bhima and Bhima took it to Draupadi.</p>
<p>Draupadi's grief diminished a small amount because she saw that the pride and glory of Ashwatthwama had fallen. She placed the crown on Yudhishthira's head saying, "You deserve this. You are the head of the Pandava family. If I see this crown on you, I will be happy because it means we have conquered him and he has surrendered to us."</p>
<p>Yudhishthira said, "If that makes you happy, I will wear it. But remember that it is painful for me to wear his crown because he is wicked to the backbone. He cruelly killed our children at night."</p>
<p>Draupadi said, "You are right. You are right. Now that Bhima has brought us the crown, let us throw it out. We don't need it. His pride is at our feet. Let us throw the crown away."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Ashwini&#039;s receptivity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ashwini&#039;s receptivity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ashwini is the name of a star. This particular star looks like the head of a horse. Therefore, it is called Ashwini because 'Ashwa' means horse.</p>
<p>The moon has twenty-seven wives, and Ashwini is one of them. Ashwini is very, very close to the moon. It is also the first star that became visible near the moon. Some of the stars were terribly jealous of Ashwini because she had tremendous beauty and because the moon had special fondness for her.</p>
<p>One day the moon said to all his wives, "For two reasons I have special fondness for my Ashwini. First, she came into my life long before all of you. Secondly, the beauty that Ashwini has pleases me most. Everybody has a special beauty, but Ashwini's beauty gives me the most joy. For these two reasons she has become closest to me."</p>
<p>"My Lord," said Ashwini, "I am beautiful, I am close to you, I came first to you, not because I deserve to, but because your compassion allowed me to. It is because you pour your own beauty into me that everyone sees beauty in me. If you take away your beauty, then I will be uglier than the ugliest. Your compassion is unparalleled. It will always remain so."</p>
<p>The moon said, "Yes, my compassion is unparalleled and, something more, unconditional. But I would like my other wives to become receptive like you. Then I will be very happy. Otherwise, my unconditional, unfathomable love-beauty will be of no avail. There should be others to receive it like you. Receptivity is of paramount importance. Otherwise, we remain where we always have been."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Arundhati</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Arundhati" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Arundhati, the wife of the sage Vashishtha, was extremely learned and extremely spiritual. She developed occult and spiritual powers by the grace of her husband. She was extremely devoted to Vashishtha.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata it is said that if one becomes virtuous and totally devoted to her husband like Arundhati, then one can easily go to Heaven and there she will be worshipped.</p>
<p>In the sky there is a special star called Arundhati. It shines most beautifully beside Vashishtha. It is said that whoever cannot see Arundhati in the sky will have a very short life. Those who cannot see Arundhati are unfortunate people. How can these people accomplish anything when they have such short lives?</p>
<p>In India when a marriage takes place, at night the village priest shows the Arundhati star to the bride so that she can become as beautiful, as learned and as spiritual as Arundhati. Arundhati is the ideal of the young girls and also of married women. To all women Arundhati represents woman's aspiration, woman's realisation, woman's beauty and woman's devotedness to the husband, plus spiritual power and occult power in infinite measure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Arishtanemi</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Arishtanemi" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the time of the Mahabharata there was a great sage named Arishtanemi. He had a beautiful young son who was conversant with the Vedas. The father was extremely proud of his son.</p>
<p>One day Arishtanemi's son was playing in the forest. It happened that a prince was hunting in the forest at the same time. Alas, he mistook the boy for a deer and killed him.</p>
<p>When the prince found out that he had slain the son of Arishtanemi, he was smitten with sorrow. He went to see Arishtanemi and beg for forgiveness. He did not know where Arishtanemi's home was, so he had to make inquiries. Finally, he came to the cottage of the boy's father and said, "Forgive me, forgive me."</p>
<p>"What have you done wrong that I have to forgive you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, your son!"</p>
<p>"My son? Do you need my son?"</p>
<p>"Arishtanemi, your son is no more."</p>
<p>"Who says my son is no more? My son is resting in his room."</p>
<p>The prince asked, "Are you sure your son is in his room?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he is."</p>
<p>"Then . . ." said the prince, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Then, what?"</p>
<p>"That means I have killed somebody else's son, not your son."</p>
<p>"Do you want to see my son?"</p>
<p>"Yes, can I see him?"</p>
<p>Arishtanemi called out, "Son! Come out, my son!" The son came out of his room.</p>
<p>"Oh! This is the boy! This is the boy that I killed!" said the prince. "How can he be alive? I saw him lying in the forest!"</p>
<p>Arishtanemi smiled and said, "O prince, how can my son be dead? You thought he was a deer and you aimed your arrow at him by mistake. You thought you killed him, but the soul of my son came to me and asked me to revive him. For me, this is like drinking water. I have occult power. I have spiritual power. As soon as his soul came, I revived him."</p>
<p>"But what about the wound? He was bleeding."</p>
<p>"That is also nothing. You did not remove the arrow, but with my occult power I removed it."</p>
<p>Oh, forgive me! I did not even remove the arrow!"</p>
<p>"I easily removed it and you cannot even see any wound."</p>
<p>"No, I can't," marvelled the prince.</p>
<p>"When I revived him, my son came to his senses and ran home. He reached here long before you."</p>
<p>"How can anyone do this?" asked the prince.</p>
<p>"You have to practice spirituality. God's Power is infinitely stronger than man's power. If you can kill someone, then God can give new life to that person. Again, if God wants someone to die, you cannot keep that person alive. My will has become one with God's Will. God wanted my son to remain on earth. Therefore, I was able to revive him. But if God had wanted my son to die from your arrow, I would have accepted my fate cheerfully. When you have implicit oneness with God's Will, you can do the miracle of miracles. But at that time, there is no such thing as a miracle. It is all perfectly natural. God's Will is the only natural reality in God's entire creation."</p>
<p>"Will your son forgive me? You may forgive me, but will your young boy ever forgive me?"</p>
<p>The son said, "The question of forgiveness does not arise. I am so grateful to you."</p>
<p>"How can you be grateful to me? I hurt you."</p>
<p>"I am grateful to you because I always wanted people to know of my father's spiritual power. Today you were the instrument which permitted my father to show his spiritual power. You are the prince. Everybody knows you. You will go to the palace and tell your father. Then the entire world will come to know who my father is. He has such tremendous occult and spiritual power. So you have done me a favour unconsciously. Therefore, I am most grateful to you."</p>
<p>The prince said, "O God, good people do live on earth. I thought that there were no good human beings on earth, for I always see people around me of my own standard. Now I see that there is another standard, in which people can be as nice as you. We shall always walk in the footsteps of good people like you two. Forgiveness is your choice. Oneness is your choice. You forgive mankind because you are one with God's Will. Again, because you are always one with God's Will, God does everything in and through you in His own Way. How I wish I could accept spirituality. But, unfortunately, my life is full of desire."</p>
<p>Arishtanemi said, "Prince, I am very pleased with you. There is an hour for everything. When your hour strikes, you will enter into spirituality. At that time I will be of real help to you. One day you will become as spiritually great as you are now physically great. The hour will definitely arrive for you to become spiritually great, too. Just wait! Have patience and I assure you that I will help you far, far beyond your imagination, for to help you at that time will be to fulfil once again my Beloved Supreme's Will. In His own Way I shall fulfil Him at His chosen hour.</p>
<p>"There is nothing divine you cannot do when you become one with God's Will. He is omniscient. He is omnipotent. He is omnipresent. He does not want to maintain His omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence only for Himself. He wants to give them away to all those who truly care for Him as their own, very own. Love Him, adore Him and fulfil Him in His own Way, for He is everything. Try to please Him in every way and do not hanker for your own fulfilment. At that time, whatever you will automatically becomes God's Will too.</p>
<p>"Now we are crying to fulfil God in God's own Way. A day will come when, by virtue of our own constant oneness with God's Will, whatever we will shall automatically become God's Will, for our will and God's Will can never be separate. The drop knows what the Source wants and the Source always knows what the drop wants. In pleasing the Source continuously, the drop becomes fully aware of the Source's Will. Again, if the drop does something spontaneously, even without being aware of God's Will, the drop will carry the Will of the Source."</p>

<p>Dangsha was a great demon who was very, very undivine. One day he stole the wife of the great sage Brighu. When Brighu discovered this, he cursed Dangsha, turning him into an insect. "You will be a most powerful insect. You will no longer be a demon," he said.</p>
<p>The demon became a most destructive insect and his name was Alarka. This insect used to bite people and cause them tremendous, tremendous suffering.</p>
<p>Parashuram, the great hero, taught his student Karna how to fight. One day, after instructing Karna for a long time, Parashuram was resting on the ground. Karna placed his teacher's head on his lap and said, "You should have some comfort. You are so kind to me. It is a great honour for me to place your head on my lap."</p>
<p>Parashuram was resting peacefully on Karna's lap when suddenly this insect, Alarka, bit Karna most powerfully. His thigh began to bleed profusely, but he remained silent because he did not want to disturb his master's peace. Still, the bite was very painful.</p>
<p>After some time Parashuram awakened and saw that Karna's thigh was bleeding profusely. He said, "What happened? What happened, my boy?"</p>
<p>"Master, while you were sleeping an insect bit me. But it is nothing. It doesn't matter at all. I am so happy that you were able to take rest for as long as you wanted to. You are always so kind to me. It gives me so much joy when I am able to serve you. You are teaching me to become a great hero, so I am so grateful to you. This small insect bite doesn't bother me at all."</p>
<p>"Karna, you are so good and divine. I will destroy this insect."</p>
<p>In a fleeting second Parashuram destroyed Alarka. Then he said, "I am grateful to you because you are really kind to me, but I am mad at you because you have deceived me."</p>
<p>"How? How have I deceived you?"</p>
<p>"Karna, you cannot be a Brahmin. You came to me as a Brahmin and that is why I taught you. But if you had been a Brahmin, you would not have tolerated this. A Brahmin's inner fire comes to the fore whenever there is any injustice. A Brahmin will not attack anybody, but when there is an injustice, a Brahmin will not tolerate it. When this insect bit you, it was a terrible injustice; yet you tolerated it. A Kshatriya can tolerate many things. Although Kshatriyas are heroes of the highest order, they have the slave mentality and, when necessary, they can tolerate anything. In your case, you have tolerated this. So from today I will not keep you as my student. You have to leave my house."</p>
<p>After some time, Karna did become a very great hero who played a significant role in the Mahabharata.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Vyasa becomes freed of depression</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Vyasa becomes freed of depression" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Vyasa was the great sage who wrote the Mahabharata. One day he was terribly depressed. He thought, "What am I going to do with my life? I am all depression, depression, depression. I have read the Vedas. I am an authority on the Vedas. Everyone comes to me for knowledge. I am the greatest of all the sages, but today I am so depressed. What am I going to do? In the Mahabharata I have written so many stories to console people when they are depressed. And now I myself am dying of depression."</p>
<p>Narada appeared before him. Narada was a great sage who sang the glories of Vishnu everywhere. He was a great seeker, the greatest singer and the greatest devotee, but sometimes he would act very undivine. He would become jealous of people who were very happy and would then create problems for them. For this reason, people called him a problem-maker.</p>
<p>When Narada appeared, Vyasa said, "O Narada, save me, save me! I am in trouble!"</p>
<p>"You are in trouble? Everybody says that I am the problem-maker," said Narada. "I can only make more problems for you. What kind of help do you need?"</p>
<p>"Narada, please tell me how I can have peace of mind. I am so depressed today."</p>
<p>"You are depressed? You have given consolation to thousands of people. Who will believe that you are depressed?"</p>
<p>"You must believe me and you must save me!"</p>
<p>"But you always call me the problem-maker!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but at the same time you are closest to Vishnu. Vishnu can console anyone. So can you not ask Vishnu to console me?"</p>
<p>"I cannot ask Vishnu that. He will laugh at me if I tell him that you, of all people, need consolation. He says that you are the wisest person on earth. He won't believe that you have become a victim of depression."</p>
<p>"But I am suffering. Please tell Vishnu. He will cure me."</p>
<p>"I can tell Vishnu, but it is not necessary. I myself can tell you how to be cured."</p>
<p>"Then please tell me. I have faith in you."</p>
<p>"You have written the Mahabharata. You know everything that is in the Vedas, but are you doing the right thing?"</p>
<p>"What have I done wrong?"</p>
<p>"Have you written one book that is only about Lord Krishna?"</p>
<p>"Oh no."</p>
<p>"Then start writing! Write the Bhagavatam, which will be all about Krishna from beginning to end. Then there will be no depression in your life. Your soul wants you to write a new book only about Krishna."</p>
<p>"All right, I am starting," he said. As soon as he started writing, his depression was transformed into delight, delight, delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The theft of the Syamantak diamond</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The theft of the Syamantak diamond" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Krishna had many wives. One of his wives was named Satyabhama. Satyabhama's father had a special diamond named Syamantak. Whenever anyone touched the diamond, immediately it produced hundreds of gold coins. Because of that diamond. Satyabhama's family was quite well-to-do, and her father was very fond of the Syamantak diamond.</p>
<p>There was a very greedy man named Shatdhanwa who became envious of Satyabhama's father, so he killed him and stole the diamond. When Satyabhama heard of this, she cried bitterly and said to Krishna, "You have to get this diamond back and kill Shatdhanwa."</p>
<p>"Definitely I shall do so," said Krishna. "How could Shatdhanwa do this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>So Krishna began searching for Shatdhanwa, but Shatdhanwa kept running away from him. Then, quite unexpectedly, Krishna suddenly found the diamond. His uncle, Akrura, had been meditating when all of a sudden somebody had dropped this diamond on his lap. When Krishna came, he found the diamond on Akrura's lap while Akrura was still in deep meditation.</p>
<p>"How did you get this?" Krishna asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know. My eyes were closed," answered Akrura. "You know I have not stolen it. Somebody put it in my lap and ran away very fast."</p>
<p>"Are you going to keep it?" Krishna asked.</p>
<p>"Never, never!" said Akrura. "I don't want this. Since you have been looking for it, you take it. It belongs to Satyabhama's father and Satyabhama and you are one, so please take it."</p>
<p>Krishna said to him, "Once you came to me and warned me of a plot against my life. You came and told me that Kangsa was going to kill me. At that time you proved to be my best friend. And here again you have done something most significant. When you got the diamond, you could have easily hidden it. But you conquered your greed and for that I am most proud of you. You have been on God's side from the very beginning. So for these two reasons I am giving you a boon."</p>
<p>"Please," said Akrura, "I do not want a boon. It is enough that I have been able to serve you twice in this incarnation of mine. For that I am so grateful to you. It is you who are working inside me. Otherwise, I would not have happened to overhear King Kangsa's plan to kill you. And now, because of you I have this diamond. You have been searching for it, and because it was put in my lap I am again in a position to serve you."</p>
<p>Akrura bowed down to Krishna. "You give me the inspiration to conquer greed. It is all your inner doing. Outwardly I am doing things and the world is giving me credit. But I know that you don't need me to save you and you don't need this diamond as your property. I know that you have been inspiring me to help you. I am so grateful that you have utilised me on these two occasions. They will remain immortal in my life."</p>
<p>Krishna said, "Friends I have, admirers I have, dear ones I have. But how I wish to have people like you. You have proven yourself to be one of my dearest ones. My outer blessing is my inner gratitude, and my inner gratitude is my soul's only satisfaction."</p>
<p>Akrura said, "You are right, you are absolutely right, Krishna, my Krishna."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Saturn defeats Indra</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Saturn defeats Indra" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Indra and Saturn (Shani) had a serious argument over who was greater. Indra said he was the greater of the two. Saturn said, "No, I am greater. Prove your supremacy."</p>
<p>Indra said, "No. It is beneath my dignity to prove it. Everybody knows that I am the King of the cosmic gods. Therefore, am I not greater than you, you fool?"</p>
<p>"Say whatever you want to," said Saturn. "I feel that I am greater."</p>
<p>"Greater in what respect?"</p>
<p>"I can do anything I want to," said Saturn.</p>
<p>Indra laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow I shall take hold of you," said Saturn. "Let me see how you can save yourself."</p>
<p>"All right," said Indra. "You will see what I can do."</p>
<p>The following day Indra went into a forest and hid. He said, "Let me see how Saturn will catch me." He did not come out of the forest the whole day. The next day Indra went to Saturn and said, "Look, Saturn, you could not keep your promise, so how can you be greater than I?"</p>
<p>Saturn said, "Can't you see? You were afraid of me. That is why you hid the entire day. If you were brave, you would have come and stood in front of me. From this can you not see that I am greater and more powerful than you?"</p>
<p>Indra accepted defeat and felt deeply embarrassed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">She lends money with wisdom</h2><span property="dc:title" content="She lends money with wisdom" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a very rich man who was extremely cruel and miserly. His wife was very kind-hearted and affectionate, and full of sympathy for everyone. Nobody liked the husband, but everybody liked the wife. However, she said, "God gave me this bad husband, so what can I do? Nobody likes him, so at least I have to like him. Somebody has to like him." She was very kind and affectionate to him and served him day and night.</p>
<p>Once a famine struck the region where they lived, and many villagers came to them for help. The wife gave money to everyone and showered all the people with affection and sympathy. Her husband did not mind her generosity, even though he was so miserly. He said, "As long as I don't have to personally give, I am satisfied." His wife was very grateful for this.</p>
<p>When she gave money to the people, they said, "We are only borrowing this money. We will pay you back."</p>
<p>She said, "No, no. You don't have to pay it back. This is a gift. You just take it."</p>
<p>They said, "No, no. We shall repay you when the famine is over."</p>
<p>She said, "If you really want to repay me, then give me the money the day my husband dies."</p>
<p>Some of the people were shocked to hear the wife talk like this. Others thought that when her husband died, she would have many expenses for the funeral and so forth, so that was why she said this.</p>
<p>One of their sons happened to be present when his mother said this. The son loved both parents dearly, but upon hearing this he was very displeased, disappointed and angry. He went to his father and said, "Mother is asking people to repay the money she is giving them after your death."</p>
<p>The father could not believe this. "How can she say this? She always gives money freely, so why is she now asking them to return the money and why does it have to be on my death?"</p>
<p>The husband went to the wife and asked her, "Please tell me why you are saying this to these people?"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't understand. You see, people don't like you. They hate you. Everybody wants you to die today. But many people have taken lots of money from me, and by nature people don't want to return money. Although they say they are taking it as a loan, they don't want to return it. So, from now on, instead of thinking of your death, they will pray to God to keep you alive so that they don't have to return the money. I want you to live on earth for many, many years. Who knows? One day you may also become very affectionate, kind-hearted and sympathetic.</p>
<p>"So, I played a trick. I want them to pray to God every day that you live. Previously they prayed to God for your death. Now they will pray to God for you to live on earth. This will make me very happy. Who cares for the money? I want you to live for a very long time."</p>
<p>The husband was extremely moved by his wife's wisdom. The son was also very pleased with his mother.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Viksha&#039;s boon</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Viksha&#039;s boon" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a King Viksha, who was very cruel and unkind. Nobody liked him. He wanted to conquer everybody. He said, "There are many ways to conquer people — with weapons, or deception, or other means. But in my case I want to conquer in a different way. I will conquer by touch. Whomever I want to kill, I will touch the head of the person and he will die immediately. How can I do this? I am undivine, but I do have faith in God. Among the cosmic gods I know Shiva is very easy to please. So I will pray to him."</p>
<p>He prayed for many, many years. One day Shiva came and said, "You have been calling, calling and calling. What do you want? I will give you whatever you want."</p>
<p>"Yes, I want something, but you can't give it to me."</p>
<p>"I can't give it to you? Then why are you praying?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have been praying to you, but I don't remember when I started."</p>
<p>Shiva said, "Many, many years ago."</p>
<p>"Oh! I have been praying for many, many years? I didn't know? I was in trance. So now you have come! I am so glad and grateful. O Lord Shiva, give me the boon that whenever I touch somebody's head, that person will die immediately. With my touch I wish to be able to turn that person's entire body to ashes."</p>
<p>Shiva said, "Wonderful. Wonderful. I am pleased with your prayer so I am giving you this boon. Whomever you touch on the head will die immediately."</p>
<p>The King said, "I am so grateful to you, so grateful! Now, may I use it on you to see if you are telling the truth?"</p>
<p>Shiva said, "You want to use it on me?"</p>
<p>"Yes! How else will I know if you are telling the truth?"</p>
<p>Shiva started running away. "O God, what have I done?" he thought. He ran to Vishnu's place, and Viksha was chasing him. With his third eye Vishnu had seen all that had happened and said to the King, "Why are you running? Why are you running? Great King, you are running after Shiva. What has he done? If you ask him to come to you, he will come. Why do you have to chase him? You are the King. We all run after you. You don't have to run after us."</p>
<p>This flattery satisfied King Viksha to a great extent. He said to Vishnu, "Look at this liar! I prayed to Shiva for so many years. He came to give me the boon, but he doesn't want me to test the boon to see if it is real or not."</p>
<p>"What kind of boon?" asked Vishnu.</p>
<p>"I asked him for the power to burn somebody to ashes just by touching his head. He gave me the boon, but when I tried to place my hands on his head, he ran away."</p>
<p>"Does it take such a long time for you to prove it?" asked Vishnu. "Just touch your own head and see if it is true or not."</p>
<p>"But if I touch my head will I not burn to ashes?"</p>
<p>"Oh no. As soon as you are about to be burned, take your hands away. Then you will know if it is true."</p>
<p>"You are right. Let me just touch my head." As soon as he did so, he was burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Shiva said to Vishnu, "Oh, you saved me!"</p>
<p>Vishnu said, "You have saved me many times. We are inseparable friends. We shall eternally remain one. When either one of us is in danger, the other will come to his rescue."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Outer beauty, but inner ugliness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Outer beauty, but inner ugliness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once a great sage named Eurba was walking along the street with his daughter, Kundala. She was very, very beautiful. As they were walking, another sage, Durbasha, saw them. Durbasha practiced austerities most soulfully, but his temper was of the quickest. He cursed people constantly and everyone knew of his temper.</p>
<p>When Durbasha saw Kundala, he immediately fell in love with her. He asked Eurba, "Please tell me who she is."</p>
<p>"She is my daughter."</p>
<p>"Your daughter?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is she married?"</p>
<p>"No. She is not married."</p>
<p>"She is so beautiful."</p>
<p>"Yes, she is beautiful, but only physically is she beautiful. Inside she is always quarreling and fighting with the members of the family. Inside she is ugly, ugly, ugly. She is jealousy incarnate."</p>
<p>"I do not know about her inner bad qualities and I do not care to hear about them. I am so full of admiration for her physical beauty. Please, please, please give me your daughter."</p>
<p>Eurba said, "No, I won't give her to you. I don't trust you. Once you see how quarrelsome and jealous she can become, you may throw her out after you are married. Although she is very undivine, I have that much sympathy for my daughter that I do not want her to suffer this kind of fate."</p>
<p>"I promise that no matter what she does, I will not use my occult power. I will never destroy her, because I am so fond of her physical beauty."</p>
<p>Eurba said, "Are you sure you will not destroy her one day when you get angry with her?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no. I promise you, I will give her everything and try only to please her. If she wants me to give up prayer and meditation, I will do so. I will give up everything for her. I won't even meditate on Lord Krishna, who is dearer than the dearest to me, if that is her wish. Once I get her, she will become my dearer than the dearest. She will be my all."</p>
<p>Eurba said, "I can't believe it."</p>
<p>"Please! Love is blind. I love this girl more than my life. She is so beautiful. Please give her to me."</p>
<p>Eurba finally agreed and in due course, Kundala and Durbasha were married. Durbasha totally forgot about spirituality. He did nothing spiritual at all. He was always with his beautiful wife, bound by her physical beauty. Kundala was constantly complaining, scolding Durbasha for everything. Even when he had not done anything wrong she scolded him. Durbasha said, "I gave up everything for you. My prayer, my meditation, my Krishna, my Beloved Lord — all I gave up for you, and still you are always scolding me."</p>
<p>"Who asked you to give up Krishna and spirituality, you fool? Nobody would have married you, but I agreed to marry you."</p>
<p>Durbasha said, "And nobody would have married you! You are so ugly inwardly. Your father was so right. In spite of knowing how bad you were, I married you."</p>
<p>"Who asked you to marry me?"</p>
<p>"My love for your physical beauty."</p>
<p>"Physical beauty? Look what you have done! You have ruined my physical beauty. You said if you married me, you would please me. Are you pleasing me in any way? I am asking you to do many things, but you are not pleasing me. I am asking you to make me very rich."</p>
<p>"How can I make you rich?"</p>
<p>"You have spiritual power, occult power. Make me very rich. I want to have many servants. I want to have a beautiful palace. If you can't give me these things, I will go on scolding and insulting you."</p>
<p>Durbasha said, "Enough! Enough! I cannot tolerate you anymore. I am destroying you with my third eye."</p>
<p>As soon as Durbasha opened up his third eye, Eurba came and said, "My boy, my boy, I told you that my daughter was so undivine. In spite of knowing that, you wanted to marry her, so I gave her to you. But don't destroy her, don't destroy her. Give me back my daughter. Since I brought her into the world I will bear the burden the rest of my life. I don't want her destroyed."</p>
<p>Durbasha said, "Either take her away, Eurba, or I am going to destroy her immediately."</p>
<p>Eurba took back his daughter and said, "God gave you to me, my daughter, and God wants me to marry patience. My name will be patience and nothing else. As long as I stay on earth, I will show you my infinite compassion and infinite forgiveness. What else can I do? If God blessed me with you, I shall pay the penalty for the rest of my life."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Krishna&#039;s supreme love</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Krishna&#039;s supreme love" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Kangsa was the hostile force incarnate. He was wicked to the backbone. He tortured each and every person in his kingdom. His worst enemy was Lord Krishna. He wanted to destroy Lord Krishna right from the very beginning, even before Krishna was mature enough to fight against him. He wanted to destroy Krishna even when Krishna was only an infant.</p>
<p>Kangsa had a friend who was a great admirer. He was also wicked to the backbone. One day, this friend came to Kangsa and said, "Your worst enemy is Krishna. I want to destroy him and make you happy."</p>
<p>"If you do this, you will make me the world's happiest person," Kangsa said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will do it."</p>
<p>One day Kangsa's friend went to Brindavan where Krishna was playing games with the gopis. The gopis were extremely happy, for they were playing with their Beloved Krishna. When this particular hostile force entered Brindavan, the gopis were frightened to death, because his face was so frightening. Krishna remained silent for some time.</p>
<p>The undivine being said to Krishna, "You remain silent because you are doing something wrong. It is undivine and immoral to play with these people. Everybody thinks that you are very spiritual and divine, but you do nothing but play with these gopis."</p>
<p>Krishna still remained silent.</p>
<p>"Yes, you remain silent because you are not doing the right thing. Had you been doing the right thing, you would have spoken."</p>
<p>Krishna said, "The right thing is always compassion and forgiveness. I have always been doing the right thing by consoling and listening to you people. But this time I have to withdraw my Compassion aspect. My Justice Light, my destruction aspect, I have to adopt."</p>
<p>In a twinkling, in front of all the gopis, Krishna destroyed this evil force. Then he said to the gopis, "My love for you people, the world will not understand. I don't care if the world understands. Your devoted hearts will always be appreciated by me. Remain devoted to me and I shall always take care of you. Here on earth and there in Heaven, I shall always take care of you, my devoted friends.</p>
<p>"Animal love, human love, divine love and supreme love. Animal love does not know what human love is. Human love does not know what divine love is. Divine love does not know what supreme love is. Animal love is ultimate destruction. Human love is ultimate frustration. Divine love is ultimate illumination. Supreme love is ultimate illumination, ultimate perfection and ultimate satisfaction.</p>
<p>"This supreme love I am offering to you, my earthly friends. If you accept my supreme love in my own supreme way, you will all be nearest and closest to me."</p>
<p>The gopis offered their gratitude-hearts through their soulful smiles.</p>

<p>Balarama, Sri Krishna's brother, was a great fighter. He had three principal weapons. Of the three, his favourite was the ploughshare. The other two were the mace and the club.</p>
<p>Bhima, of the Pandavas, and Duryodhana, of the Kauravas, learned how to use the mace from him. When the Pandavas and Kauravas fought, Balarama remained neutral. Once, Bhima adopted foul means while fighting with Duryodhana. This offended Balarama's sense of fair play terribly. So he immediately seized his club to punish Bhima.</p>
<p>But Sri Krishna restrained him. Sri Krishna said, "True, this time Bhima was wrong, but Brother, many, many times Bhima was innocent when Duryodhana showed tremendous hostility towards him and his brothers. You know, Brother, right from his boyhood, Duryodhana treated Bhima badly. So please forgive Bhima for this misdeed. It is only once he has done this, whereas he has been treated mercilessly so many times by Duryodhana."</p>
<p>So Balarama forgave Bhima.</p>
