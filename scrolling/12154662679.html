<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of music in the spiritual life is extremely important and significant. God is the Supreme Musician, and His entire creation is His divine Music. At every moment we can be His conscious instruments. And spiritual music itself is an instrument to show us our universal Reality.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Then you agree with the traditional idea of man being a hollow bamboo flute that God plays?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, that is what we are all striving for — to be the instruments of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am referred to as a spiritual Master, but I will always call myself a seeker, an eternal seeker learning at the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. Life is the greatest opportunity to make progress, and at every moment we can avail ourselves of this opportunity. Each of us is a seeker, walking along Eternity’s Road, which has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> You are saying that we are all disciples?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all seekers. Some of us are consciously seeking; some are unconsciously seeking. But if we do something consciously, then we derive more benefit.</p>

Could you talk about the relationship between a Master and a devotee or disciple?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A spiritual Master is one who illumines the seeker. The Master is like a private tutor who helps the seeker learn the inner knowledge, so that he can fight against ignorance-night and swim in the sea of wisdom-light. A private tutor teaches the student and helps him in every way to learn the subject. Then, when the student sits for the examination at school, he does well. So a spiritual Master is he who carefully teaches the student how to pass the inner examination. But there is only one real Teacher, and that is the Lord Supreme Himself. We spiritual Masters are only His instruments.</p>
<p>If I know a little more than you do in one particular field, then I can help you. If you know more than I do about something else, then you can help me in that field. In a family, if the older brother knows more about the father than his younger brothers and sisters, then he is in a position to teach them. But he will not claim to be the father. The older brother will tell the younger ones, “I know a little bit more than you do about our father, so I will tell you how you can approach him.” We who are called spiritual Masters are like older brothers to humanity. We are members of the same family trying to teach our younger brothers and sisters to value, appreciate, admire and adore our heavenly Father.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Are you saying that we are all masters in some area of life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. If I want to know something about how a radio station operates, you will be in a position to teach me. In this field I am totally helpless. So if I want to find out about this, then I will go to an expert in this field and learn from him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of personal choice and inner conviction. In the past we always listened to the mind. Our mind told us to do certain things, and we tried to obey the mind because it was the boss. But we were not satisfied. Now we want our heart to be the boss. Our heart is telling us that there is another way — that if we can identify ourselves with a higher reality, then we will have more satisfaction and more perfection in our life.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> What I understand you to be saying is that the mind itself never gives satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are right; the mind never gives us satisfaction. The mind tells us, “Do this, and you will be happy.” We do what the mind asks, but we never find happiness.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> The mind keeps trying to convince us that we are happy.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind wants to convince us of certain realities, but when we dive deep within, we see that the mind is totally wrong. Real happiness we will never get by listening to the mind. Right now the mind is not deliberately fooling us. The mind thinks it knows the truth, but unfortunately it does not. Then there comes a time when the mind becomes fed up with its imperfections and admits that it has failed to give us happiness. It sees that when we knock at our heart’s door and enter into the heart’s room, we get joy. The mind also wants joy and happiness, so at that time the mind becomes the student of the heart.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> That’s interesting. The mind then surrenders to the heart.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it surrenders because it also needs happiness and peace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is something that goes beyond the mind. The mind is limited. It always thinks of “I,” “my” and “mine.” But meditation is unlimited. When we meditate, we become aware of our universal Reality, of our universal Oneness. At that time we become one with our self-giving heart. A tiny drop wholeheartedly gives its reality, its finite existence, to the mighty ocean. When it surrenders its separate existence, it becomes one with the ocean itself. So, when we give, we get infinitely more in return. Self-giving is God-becoming. The moment we give ourselves soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally to the Infinite, we become the Infinite Itself. When we offer our little earthly existence to our Beloved Supreme, we become inseparably one with His universal and transcendental Reality.</p>

What are some of the reasons for and the benefits of meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation is self-discovery. We try to discover many things in life, but unfortunately most of the time we do not try to discover ourselves. When we do discover ourselves through meditation, we see clearly that we are chosen instruments of God. A chosen instrument is he who has peace of mind and who can offer peace of mind to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Meditation always helps us to see the universal Truth, universal Beauty and universal Delight in ourselves. When we meditate, we feel that the world has real meaning. For most human beings, the world has nothing to offer except suffering, misery and unfortunate experiences. But when we meditate, we see that the world is not like that. It has beauty, it has purity, it has oneness. The world is God’s creation, and God is all Light and Delight. So how can His creation be all suffering? When we meditate, we try to discover the supreme secrets that show us how we can always serve mankind and fulfil our highest Reality.</p>

What do you suggest people use as a method of meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one does not have a teacher, then I advise the seeker to try to make the mind calm and quiet and not allow any wrong thoughts to enter. As soon as a seeker is assailed by a wrong thought, he has to try to destroy it. He has to open himself only to encouraging, illumining and fulfilling thoughts. If hatred enters into my mind while I am meditating, I will try to replace it with love. If insecurity enters into my mind, I will try to replace it with security. And if doubt about my spiritual capacity enters into my mind, I will immediately try to bring faith to the fore to conquer the doubt.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Regularity is of paramount importance. Every day we eat at least twice, if not three times, to satisfy the demands of our physical body. Similarly, we have to meditate every day to nourish our soul, our inner existence. So, let us do the first thing first. Since the soul was created before the body, we have to think of the child who came into the family first. If we think of the body before we think of the soul, we are putting the cart before the horse. So at least twice a day every sincere seeker should meditate.</p>

<p><em>Caller:</em> As I am listening to Sri Chinmoy on the radio, I feel tremendous divine Love emanating from him, and I am wondering how I can be more receptive to that divine Love.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be more receptive to the divine Love if you can feel every day that your Source is all Love, and that you are on earth to offer constantly, in thought and in action, the love that you already have. At every moment you have many thoughts, so you can offer love through each of your thoughts. And each time you do something, you can feel that this action is nothing but an expression of love. Right now, offering love through thought and action is of supreme importance in your life. While thinking and while acting, if you can feel that you are offering love to mankind, to the rest of the world, then you can be more receptive to the universal Love. In this way you can feel that God’s divine Love is all for you.</p>

Running in the outer life makes us active and dynamic. Also, the outer running reminds us that we must run inwardly. Each human being is walking along Eternity’s Road. If we can run in the inner world instead of just walking, then our progress will be much faster, and we will reach our goal sooner. So every day we run or do physical exercises in order to become strong, healthy and dynamic. These qualities in our outer life help us considerably in our inner life. Again, our prayer and meditation also help us in our running. Through prayer and meditation we can develop intense will power. This will power can help us do extremely well in our outer running.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a wrong conception that meditation is something abnormal, or that we have to enter into the Himalayan caves in order to realise God. God is everywhere. When we approach God with our heart, we feel closeness and oneness with the rest of the world. When we pray and meditate properly, we feel that there is only one family, and that is God’s Family. If we approach reality with our heart, then we will see that there is nothing but oneness. We have to meditate in the heart, with the heart, to bring forward the soul. If we can do this, then we will always feel abiding oneness within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A week ago I composed this song, which is my soulful dedication to the soul of Hawaii. I have been deeply moved, inspired and energised by the inner and outer beauty of Hawaii. Here in Hawaii we see two aspects of the divine Reality: power and beauty. Usually we do not see these two mighty attributes together. But here I see both beauty and power. When I look at the mountains, I see beauty and power. When I look at the sea, I see beauty and power. When I look at nature all around, it is all beauty and power. When I look at the individuals who live here, again I see beauty and power. Beauty and power together have inspired and illumined me here in Hawaii, and the result is this, my most humble and most soulful offering to the soul of Hawaii:</p>

<p>Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii!<br /> O eastern sun, O western sky!<br /> Quality-heart, quantity-mind:<br /> Truth-seekers, life-lovers, In you find.</p>

<p>Now I wish to sing the song.</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy sings.]</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> Thank you very much; it’s lovely. You've been listening to spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy singing a song that he composed about a week ago. I love that idea of the beauty and power of Hawaii side by side. A lovely thought, a lovely thought.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to mention — earlier you were talking about radio. One of the very powerful things that I feel is unique to radio is that it is a very emotional medium. Radio is the medium of the heart, whereas television is a visual medium. I think that one of the things that happens with this programme, and with other radio programmes as well, is that the listener gets a kind of inner feeling about the person who is being interviewed. I think that today the listeners, in addition to hearing what you are saying, have had the opportunity to get a very deep feeling about you. You have been talking about the heart, and I hope that they have been able to feel the universal aspect of your heart and of your work. And I want to really commend you for your contributions, not only to individual seekers, but also to the entire planet through the United Nations. We do live on one planet.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely true, and we are of one family; therefore, we should be for one family: mankind. Meditation teaches us the consciousness of oneness, and it is that awareness which unites both Heaven and earth.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> It’s past eleven, and I know that you have another engagement. I would love to have you join us again sometime when you are here. You are certainly most welcome, and this has been thoroughly delightful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving me the golden opportunity to be of real, dedicated service to many, many sincere seekers here in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This book consists of four lectures that Sri Chinmoy delivered while visiting Hawaii in March 1980, and a radio interview he gave there a few months earlier. Inspired by the beauty and power of the islands, he composed a song [cite:WING 1] which portrays the inner qualities of Hawaii.</p>
