<p>This afternoon I went to Woolworth's and bought a book that had answers to all kinds of questions. While I was in the store, a man came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes," and I smiled at him.</p>
<p>He said, "I wish to give you a piece of advice: you run too much! I always see you running on 150th Street, on the Grand Central Service Road and at other places. At our age we should walk.</p>
<p>"I saw you the other day while I was walking. I tried to catch up with you to tell you not to run, but you ran ahead. I know you are not going to accept my advice. So keep up what you are doing."</p>
<p>What could I do? I thanked him profusely.</p>

<p>In Australia, Kishore and Prashanta were running here and there looking for my favourite fruit-jackfruit. Finally Prashanta came and told me that they had found some. So I said, "Let me go and see."</p>
<p>When I saw the jackfruit, I wanted to buy some, but the store manager didn't want to sell any. Instead, he gave us three times as much as we wanted-free!While we were eating the fruit, the manager came with three pieces of another kind of fruit, which he said was even more delicious than jackfruit. That also the manager wanted to give us free.</p>
<p>Then Kishore told him who I was, but the man said he already knew.</p>

<p>After I finished shopping on Jamaica Avenue, one of the boys was supposed to come and collect me. I waited and waited for the car, but it did not come. Finally, I started walking home, carrying a huge bag.</p>
<p>The manager of Marine Midland Bank noticed me walking by and knocked on the window, waving for me to come in. So I went into the bank and we talked. He told me his daughter is studying yoga in Sarama's class.</p>

<p>I told him, "The restaurant owner is my student."</p>
<p>Then the man said, "I understand you do many things for peace. What do you actually want for the world?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do not want or expect anything from the world. Only I want to become a better person."</p>
<p>Then I smiled and he also smiled. He looked like Y.</p>

<p>He said, "I was born in Cologne."</p>
<p>Then I asked him to write down Cologne the way they write it in German. He said his parents are from Spain, but his father worked in Germany for a few years and that is where he was born. He knew a little bit of German, and he started saying things in German.</p>
<p>I went out to search for some of our German boys who could talk to him, but by the time I found them, this little fellow had disappeared.</p>

<p>We went into a music shop in Essouira, Morocco. The man thought that I came from Morocco. Savyasachi said, "He is from India."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, he is Moroccan." Then he asked me, "Are you Muslim?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am Hindu."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, you are Muslim. I can see you are an Arab."</p>
<p>Then he asked me how old I was, and I told him. He told me that his father was 105 years old and showed us his picture. The father had been married five times and had 21 children.</p>
<p>Based on what he told us, the man in the store would be over 40 years old. So jokingly I asked him, "Are you 29 years old?"</p>
<p>He said, "Twenty-nine!" Then he took off his hat and showed me his bald head.He was so nice to us. He was showing us all his instruments. He explained how one skin instrument immediately changes for the better when exposed to fire. Then he set fire to a piece of wood and put it over the skin frame, and it sounded so much better.</p>

<p>What an experience!</p>
<p>Then his wife said, "Please take your picture now, and when you lose weight with the help of our exerciser, send us another picture. Then we will keep both pictures here in our store so that people can see how much weight they can lose."</p>
<p>I was so amused, but I didn't have a camera with me.</p>

<p>In Australia, A, Kishore and I went to an Indian restaurant. From the window we could see that all the food was already cooked.</p>
<p>When we went inside, they drew a screen around the kitchen so they could tell us that everything was being cooked fresh. They were delaying like anything — just pretending they were making it fresh.</p>
<p>After ten minutes I told them that we had already seen the food cooked and to please give it to us. They didn't deny it; they just laughed and gave us the food. Otherwise, they would have kept us waiting an hour, pretending that they were cooking it.</p>

<p>The lady brought us one that cost $65. I liked it so much. I asked, "Can you give us an expensive bow?"</p>
<p>She said, "You don't get a bow." Then she gave me a rotten bow.</p>
<p>At first she couldn't find the case. Buy a violin, but there is no case! Finally she found one.</p>
<p>She knew English well, but all the time she was talking in German. Just as we were ready to go, she started speaking English. For four or five minutes she had to speak to us in English!</p>
<p>So this is how we got the violin that Projjwal bought me on his birthday.</p>
