<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not only in the mind; God is the mind itself. But we have to know what kind of mind we are speaking of. If it is the physical mind, the earthbound mind, the mind that cherishes and treasures jealousy, meanness and impurity, this is not the mind that can be of any help in our search for God. The mind that is as wide and vast as the sky, the mind that accepts and loves the entire world, is the real mind. Inside that mind God functions most satisfactorily. So we have to know which mind you are referring to.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So you're saying that the person who thinks in a positive way, the person who thinks in a way that is honest and sincere and concerned about all the people in the world, that person is using the mind in a spiritual way?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Caller:</em> But they say that God is a jealous God.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> That's a very good religious point. What about when they say that God is a jealous God?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is jealous only for those who have not experienced God the Supreme Beloved, God the Eternal Compassion, God the Eternal Friend.</p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> So you're saying that God is a friend?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is our Eternal Friend and our only true Friend.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a person feels that what the Bible says is absolutely true and has implicit faith in the Bible's teachings, then he should definitely continue in his life of faith. But if somebody says that there are a few things he cannot accept from the Bible, and if he wants to get some new clarification or new illumination in his life by studying something else or by diving deep within, then he is entitled to do so. God wants satisfaction in us. If someone gets satisfaction from absolute faith in the Bible, wonderful. But if he does not find satisfaction there, then let him study something else. Let him study his own life: let him dive deep within in order to find the truth which will satisfy him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Questions and answers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Questions and answers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the main contributing factor to your faith, and how is it different from other faiths?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, in the spiritual life there is no competitive spirit, so I do not compare our path with other paths. Each path has its own value. Each path has a specific way of leading the aspirant to his destined Goal. Our path is the path of love, devotion and surrender to the Will of the Supreme. This is what we particularly emphasise. I cannot say in what ways this path is different from other paths, because I am not familiar with other paths.</p>
<p>If somebody follows our path, then he tries to develop or bring to the fore his inner love, spiritual love. Unlike human love which binds, divine love expands and illumines our consciousness within and without.</p>
<p>When we offer devotion, what we are offering is our one-pointed devotion to the Supreme, the Inner Pilot within us. In our ordinary human life, what we call devotion is nothing short of ignorant attachment. But divine devotion is something totally different. Here we are offering ourselves to the right cause, to the divine within us, so that we can grow into a sea of Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>The surrender that we try to achieve on our path is not the surrender of a slave to his master. The slave is always afraid of the master. He feels that if he doesn't satisfy the master, then the master will do him some injury. There is always a sense of fear in the heart and mind of the slave. But in the spiritual life, when the seeker surrenders to his inner divinity, to the Supreme within him, he feels that he is surrendering to his own highest and most illumined existence. He is surrendering to his own highest part, to his highest height and inmost light.</p>
<p>This is the basis of our path in a nutshell. If I compare our path with other paths, then I enter into unfortunate controversies. Other paths can also be right and perfect. But the two main paths are the path of the mind and the path of the heart. Our path is a path of the heart. It is up to the individual seeker to decide which type of path will suit him, and then to follow it. Ultimately, when a seeker reaches his destined Goal, there he will also see the seekers who have been sincerely following other paths. All will reach the same destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What has been lost? Our conscious oneness with the Absolute Supreme has been lost. Through our inner search we are trying to gain or regain our conscious inseparable oneness with Him. We are seeking for Truth and Light. Once upon a time, we were possessors of this infinite Truth and Light. But unfortunately, we made friends with ignorance-night and lost our inseparable oneness with Infinity's Light and Bliss. It is through conscious seeking — our conscious inner search and inner mounting cry — that at God's choice Hour we shall once again get back our inner wealth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What are the advantages of surrendering to the personal Master as opposed to surrendering to the impersonal, to the Spirit itself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What are the advantages of surrendering to the personal Master as opposed to surrendering to the impersonal, to the Spirit itself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank with you, there is only one real Master both in Heaven and on earth, and that Master is God Himself. Here I am called a spiritual Master, but I wish to say that I am not a Master. What I am is only an elder brother to a small spiritual family. Because I have prayed and meditated, or because the Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given me a little more Light than the other members of my spiritual family, I try to help them reach the highest Goal.</p>
<p>If the disciple sees or feels Light abundant Light, in his Master, then he can claim it as his very own on the strength of his oneness with his Master. At that time, the disciple has to feel that this Light is something which he himself already had, and which the M aster is only bringing to the fore. It was his own possession, his own treasure; but he misplaced it, and it was covered over with ignorance. Now the Master, with his boundless Light and concern, has entered into the disciple's ignorance and kindled there the flame of aspiration, bringing Light into his entire being.</p>
<p>The Master, in both his personal and impersonal aspect, is one reality. What actually happens is this. When a disciple comes to the human Master, he sees Peace, Light and Bliss according to his own capacity or receptivity. The higher and the deeper he goes, the more he feels that the Peace, Light and Bliss that he wants, he can get from the Master. He feels that his Master is a direct channel from the Highest; his Master represents, for him, God on earth.</p>
<p>When we stand in front of the sea, it looks quite vast. The length and breadth of the sea is beyond our ability to grasp as a whole. So what we do is touch with our hands or our feet just a little water. The moment we touch the water, the consciousness of the water enters into our being. Then we feel the capacity and the quality of the boundless sea. Similarly, when the disciple stands in front of his own Master and sees or feels the Master's Light, this represents the highest Truth for him. So, if a seeker sees his Master as infinite, as perfect, then he can make faster progress than otherwise, because he has an ideal before him. The Light that he sees in the Master offers him a glimpse of the Highest, the Infinite. At that time, the distinction between the personal Master and the impersonal Master, between personality and impersonality, disappears for him. He does not see the Master as a human being with a human body. He does not see the master's physical as such. What he sees goes far, far beyond the Master's personal form; it cannot be grasped by the physical mind. He sees the Master as a part of the infinite Light or Truth for which he has been searching for millennia.</p>
<p>For a particular seeker, there is only one Master. That Master may or may not be in the physical; but he is not the physical as such. He is in Eternity's transcendental Spirit, infinite Peace, infinite Light and infinite Bliss. A Master of the highest order can and must embody this Peace, Light and Bliss. If we say that any human being, although he is a Master with millions and billions of disciples, is God, then it will be a mistake. God is within us, in each individual. But the real Master, the absolutely highest and the most perfect Master, is both on earth and in Heaven. He is not the physical form, but He is inside the physical.</p>
<p>If the student has faith in the Master, implicit faith, naturally the student makes faster progress. Whether we call that person the Master or not is of secondary importance, but we have to have faith in him. In the spiritual life, faith is of paramount importance and eventually we have to know that if we have faith only in the Master, it will not serve our purpose. We must have faith in ourselves as well. If we do not have faith in ourselves along with faith in the Master, then we cannot go far. But if we also have faith in ourselves, we can say we are God's chosen children and that infinite Peace, Light and Bliss are our birthright. If we can say this, then our journey's end can never be a far cry.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you explain the fall of man?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you explain the fall of man?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day we are assailed by doubt, and every day we are inspired and energised by faith. When we are assailed by doubt, what we notice is our conscious fall. We cannot expand; we doubt our own capacity, even our very existence. When doubt enters into our mind early in the morning, it is impossible for us to come out of our tiny mental room. But when we are inspired and energised by faith, we feel that the whole world belongs to us.</p>
<p>Each human being here has both doubt and faith. The moment he uses his doubt instrument he feels that everything in his life is circumscribed. His progress comes to a standstill. But when he uses the other instrument, faith, he feels that he is flying up to the highest plane of consciousness and singing the song of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>Every day we can bind ourselves or we can free ourselves. We sing the song of bondage consciously or unconsciously by feeding the teeming doubt within us. We fall from the reality-tree again and again when we play with our doubt-friend. But when we dive deep within and bring our heart-illumining and soul-manifesting faith to the fore, we climb up the reality-tree high, higher, highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My simple answer to this question is that it is up to you what to believe or not to believe. If you believe what the Bible says, then you believe that if you do not follow its teachings, you will go to hell. But if you don't believe it, then you are not obliged to do what the book says.</p>
<p>There have been many spiritual Masters of the highest order on earth. The Christ was not the only one. Before him was the Buddha, and before the Buddha was Sri Krishna. A number of spiritual Masters of the very highest order have walked on earth. Recently there were Sri Ramakrishna and Sri Aurobindo. But if you believe that particular teaching of the Bible, it is up to you. If you believe it, prepare yourself divinely so that you can immediately go to Heaven, or prepare yourself to take your punishment.</p>
<p>Heaven and hell are largely in our mind. If you treasure a good thought, then you are creating Heaven. If you cry to God for Light, then you get a good experience, an illumining experience, and this experience is nothing but Heaven. Again, if you treasure a negative thought, then you are creating hell. Heaven and hell can be experienced every day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A seeker can tell a true living Master if his inner and outer being is inundated with delight and ecstasy when he approaches the Master. If you see a real spiritual Master, he may not be your Master, but your inner joy will determine if he is real. Again, you may stand in front of a true Master and not get anything, because you are in a low consciousness. But if your heart is crying for a real Master, then you are bound to feel something when you stand in front of one. And if you find your own Master, you will find everything that you need in this life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In order to acquire harmony, one needs peace of mind in order to have peace of mind, one needs to pray and meditate most soulfully on the Inner Pilot, who has created the necessity for inner harmony; one prays properly, then peace of mind and harmony will be reflected in all one's outer movements. When the mind has peace, then there is always harmony in all the activities which take place in one's being.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Before I became a disciple, I donated my body tissue to a tissue bank — like a hospital where you can donate organs of your body when you die. Should I try to get out of that obligation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Before I became a disciple, I donated my body tissue to a tissue bank — like a hospital where you can donate organs of your body when you die. Should I try to get out of that obligation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now that you have accepted our path, what is your immediate reaction?</p>
<p>Question: My present feeling is that it doesn't make any difference to me.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of individual opinion. In India, a body is burned for purification. In the West it is usually buried. My feeling is that the body has to be purified to the end. As long as it is a physical body, the need for purification remains, and as long as the body as such remains, it must get a chance for purification. For this, Agni, the Fire-God, is invoked.</p>
<p>In the West, people feel that if they donate their dead body to science, they will be making an offering. The body has made tremendous sacrifices to mankind, to Mother Earth; but as long as it isn't totally disintegrated, they may feel they have to offer it again. Here it is a question of sacrifice. If you are convinced that by sacrificing your body to medical science you are going to help medical science to gain knowledge and wisdom, then you can do it. Again, although you will be dead, the body has an inner consciousness which will be there. In order to gain a little knowledge, some doctors will take pleasure in torturing your body. They will say they are making the supreme discovery. Now, it is you who have to make the final decision. If you pray and meditate, you will try to do the right thing. If you dive deep within, you will get the message.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Several times during my working day I take a moment to offer gratitude to you. Is there any special way I should do this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Several times during my working day I take a moment to offer gratitude to you. Is there any special way I should do this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is an excellent thing. When you offer gratitude to me, try to feel that that gratitude is a world. Your gratitude is tinier than the tiniest, like an ant. But you will try to increase that gratitude into a huge elephant. If you feel that the gratitude-power which you are offering to me is very tiny, absolutely negligible, your feeling is the essence of humility or modesty. But you have to try to grow and expand it. You have to increase your capacity from that of a tiny ant to that of an elephant. Then you will be happy. When your gratitude becomes an elephant, try to have other qualities also. Once it is very huge, vast and strong, inside that powerful elephant try to have all the divine qualities: simplicity, sincerity, purity, humility and so forth. At that time, feel that you have all these things inside you.</p>
<p>So, first you have to feel the necessity of making your gratitude quality large, larger, largest. Then, when you feel that your gratitude has become an elephant, try to see all the divine qualities that you have inside it. All the divine qualities are inside your gratitude-heart. Then you are bound to feel that you are growing into an exemplary instrument of the Supreme. This is how to bring forward all the good qualities that you have. Then you can maintain the highest consciousness all the time while you are at work.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can I do if I tend to fall asleep during meditation and other spiritual activities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can I do if I tend to fall asleep during meditation and other spiritual activities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a matter of giving importance to the things that come first in your life. Suppose something important is taking place and at that time you are falling asleep. For eight to nine hours before that you have worked very hard for me: therefore you feel it is quite natural on your part to sleep. There is no end to our power of justification. But by justifying yourself, are you gaining anything? Suppose I hold a very high, significant meditation and you sleep through it. You think, "He knows I have worked for him," which is true. You can justify your sleeping. But the next question is, have you missed anything by sleeping through the meditation? You have missed something, and you will not be able to get that thing by justifying yourself</p>
<p>Then you have to ask, "Has Guru given me outer permission to miss this activity just because I have worked?" At the press, when they work overnight sometimes I tell them that they don't have to come to meditation. If I say this, then I take full responsibility, and I will definitely give them the fruits of the meditation that they otherwise would have had. But if you do not have my permission, then you will still get the fruits of your previous dedicated action. But for the meditation you have missed you will get nothing. For your sleeping I will not be responsible, because I have not made any commitment to you. You will say you were tired; I will say you were lethargic. Here is the proof. It takes only a second for you to approach me and ask me whether you should miss the meditation. Then I will make a commitment and the problem is solved.</p>
<p>There are various ways to keep yourself awake when you are sleepy. Do <em>japa</em> as fast as possible. Wash your eyes, nose and ears with cold water. Pinch yourself again and again. Stand up and keep your eyes open. A little physical discomfort is nothing in comparison to what you will get in return: Peace, Bliss and Light. The problem lies with your sincerity. If you are sincere, you will value everything properly.</p>
<p>Some people meditate for a half an hour and then they feel that they are in a position to relax — watch television, read comic books and so on. They have meditated for a half an hour, but they don't realise that perhaps this half hour has only taken them to the starting point. When one is not realised, one has to be very, very careful. So if you have worked extremely hard and you are unable to meditate with your normal intensity, then after you have meditated for half an hour you can read some of my writings. Or, if you are at home, you can listen to my music or look at my paintings. Your Guru has quite a few things to offer. I have written poems, I have composed songs — hundreds of things I have done.</p>
<p>Stop wasting your time watching TV and reading magazines. You can run the fastest by meditating. But when you become tired, don't give up running. If you sit down, you are disqualified. Continue running, even if you have to go slowly. Relax your speed, but continue to discipline your life. Meditate. Repeat 'Supreme'. Read my writings. All of you should do this. There are so many easy ways you can keep your consciousness high because I have a variety of spiritual activities for you. If you don't like this one, you will like that one. When meditation becomes difficult, you can read. If you lose your concentration, you can sing. When you are tired of singing, you can come back to meditation. This is how you can regulate your life. Run the fastest when you have the capacity. When you don't have the capacity, then walk. But if you stop moving forward altogether, you will never reach the Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What three qualities are most needed for survival on our spiritual path?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What three qualities are most needed for survival on our spiritual path?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most people want to know how to run the fastest, but you want to know only how to survive. All right. There is only one quality that we all need. To name three qualities would be redundant. Only one quality can solve all your problems — everybody's problems — and that quality is called a gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>God has brought you into this world from the soul's world, and He has given you the opportunity to manifest Him. There are still countless souls in the soul's region, but He has given you the golden opportunity to serve Him and manifest Him here on earth. And He has shown you the light. When you look around, you see that your old friends are still wallowing in the sea of ignorance. But you have entered in the spiritual life and have really become something. You can easily offer Him your gratitude heart for what He has already done for you, for it is not by virtue of your own will that you have entered into the spiritual life. Just think of what you were before you accepted our path and what you have become now. Immediately you will see the difference between night and day and you will be so happy. Again, you will see that the day can also become bright, brighter, brightest. Now it is dawn. Soon it will be proper morning. Then the brilliant noon will come. The earthly day is followed by night but the inner day does not have any night. There is only the infinite effulgence of ever-increasing Light. After the inner dawn comes the eternal, infinite Day that is filled with infinite Light and Delight. Now you are entering into this eternal Day. What you have already become you know, and that is satisfying to you Now you can say that you want to become something even more. So God has given you something to become constantly, and that is your gratitude heart.</p>
<p>Every day count the petals of your gratitude-heart and open another petal. If you want to name the petals, they are simplicity, sincerity, purity, humility and so on. Constantly offer your heart of gratitude. That is the only quality that will help everyone solve his problems and also run the fastest. Gratitude embodies all the divine qualities in God's creation. If we are grateful, it is enough. When a child offers a smile to his parents, it is his gratitude-heart coming to the fore. Sometimes, when adults smile at a spiritual Master, they may not know the actual reason for their smile. But I wish to say that it is their gratitude-heart coming to the fore. Yesterday, Databir's mother came in the meeting. I was smiling at her and all of a sudden she smiled back. Databir asked her, "What do you feel?" She said, "I don't know. I just smiled." Actually, all of a sudden her soul came to the fore and offered its qualities, but she did not know it. She thought it was just a smile. I smiled at her, so she smiled at me.</p>
<p>So, good boy, you do not need three qualities to survive: you need only one quality to survive and to run the fastest, and that is a gratitude-heart.</p>
