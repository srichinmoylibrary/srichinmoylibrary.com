  <h2 id="page-title">God for a child</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God for a child" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We know that God is everything: God is inside everything and God is beyond everything. This is our philosophical understanding and our psychic understanding. But I wish to speak about God from a child’s pure, innocent and soulful point of view, according to the child’s understanding.</p>
<p>What is God? God is Concern. A mother will try to show her concern for her child day in and day out. But out of twenty-four hours his mother can consciously offer him only two or three hours of concern, in spite of her best intentions. She wants to show him all her affection all the time: but we know that during the day she has to study, do her own meditation and do quite a few other things apart from taking care of him, even though he is her dearest child. When he is sick, perhaps she will offer her concern for fifteen or sixteen or even twenty four hours. But ordinarily she can give him only a few hours of concern in God’s case, it is different. He constantly gives us His inner and outer Concern.</p>
<p>We stay on earth for fifty, sixty, seventy or even one hundred years, but this is not our real span of life. Our real life is endless. We came from the beginningless past and we shall enter into the endless future. We have had previous incarnations and we will have many future incarnations. In our past incarnations we had different parents. In this incarnation we get concern from our mother and father, in our previous incarnation we got it from other parents and in the future also we will receive concern from different parents. But we received God’s Concern from the very beginning. Now also he has the same kind of Concern for us and forever it will remain the same.</p>
<p>You have a body, you have a mind, you have a heart and you have a soul. When God created you, He created your soul first. The moment He created your soul, His Concern started. This Concern was not only for a minute, for an hour, for a year, for ten years or for twenty years, but forever, for Eternity. God is constant and eternal Concern. The moment He created Himself, Concern was there: and the moment He created your soul, Concern was there. So this is what we mean when we say that God is Concern.</p>
<p>Now where does this Concern come from? Everything has a source and the source of concern is oneness. When my finger is hurt or bleeding, immediately I am concerned for my finger. Why? Because I am one with my finger. When something is wrong with your mother, you show her your concern because of your oneness with her. Right now, there are many people who are suffering and dying in the hospital, but even if you knew them, you might not offer them your concern. Why? Because you are not completely identified with them and you don’t feel your oneness with them. But you do feel your oneness with your mother and your mother feels her oneness with you. So we see that the source of concern is oneness. It is to the near and dear ones, those who we feel are part and parcel of our life, that we offer our concern. God is the all-pervading One, who is everywhere and His Concern comes from His all-pervading oneness. Since He is everywhere, he has to have oneness with everything. When He has oneness, He has to offer something; and that something is His Concern.</p>

<p>God looks exactly like us. In your case, when you see God He will look exactly like you. When somebody else sees God, God will look exactly like that individual. When any member of your family sees God, He will look exactly like that particular person. As soon as you see God you will say “He looks like me!” God’s Eyes, His Face, everything of His will look the same as you. The only difference will be that He is infinitely more beautiful than you because your own most illumined part is infinitely more beautiful than your least illumined part. Although at that time you will be able to recognise Him and claim Him as your very own, somebody else may not be able to recognise Him because He has come to you and nobody else. You will be able to recognise God as yourself, but with infinite Beauty, infinite Light, infinite Peace, infinite Bliss. That is how you will see God and how you will know Him when you see Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Does God test us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Does God test us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Does God ever test us? No, God does not actually test or examine us. It is ignorance operating through hostile forces, undivine forces, that examines us. We have been with ignorance for many, many thousands of years. The moment we start aspiring. ignorance threatens us. It says. “Where are you going? You have been in my room for thousands of years. Now how can you dare to leave me?” We reply, “I made a mistake in staying with you for such a long time. Now I don’t want to stay with you anymore.” Then ignorance puts all kinds of temptation before us.</p>
<p>So when we accept the spiritual life, we have to face all kinds of temptation. A temptation is nothing but a kind of test. If we pass these tests, we become one with God. At first God will only watch and observe. If on the one hand we say outwardly that we don’t want to stay with ignorance, but on the other hand we secretly enjoy wallowing in earthly pleasures, then God simply keeps quiet. We may say that we don’t want to eat ignorance-food, but at the same time we continue eating it. Here we are acting like a camel. A camel eats thorns and his mouth bleeds. He will say to himself that he will never eat these thorns again, but soon afterwards he does the same thing. Like this, some of us say we don’t want to stay anymore with ignorance, but the next moment we again become most intimate friends with ignorance.</p>
<p>But if He sees that we are sincerely trying to pass our examination, then immediately He will give us the capacity. When He feels that we really don’t want to mix with ignorance, that we no longer want to have anything to do with it, then He gives us infinite inner power and strength to come out of ignorance.</p>
<p>God never tests; God never tempts. He will just give us the inner strength to conquer temptations. God’s Compassion itself is our greatest Power. But we receive His Power only when we are sincere. God’s help, just like sunlight, is there for everyone. If somebody keeps his doors and windows open, then he receives sunlight in his room.</p>
<p>But if he keeps the doors and windows shut, then sunlight cannot enter. So God’s divine Compassion is constantly raining down, but we have to keep our heart’s door open. Only then will we be able to come out of ignorance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God’s Name</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God’s Name" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is one God called by many different names. I like the term ‘Supreme’. Other Masters have used different names. Jesus Christ used the term ‘Father’. He said, ‘I and my Father are one.’ His Father, your Father and my Father are the same, but I get a sweeter feeling from using the term ‘Supreme’ instead or saying ‘God’ or ‘Father’.</p>
<p>All religious faiths have the same God but they address Him differently. A man will be called ‘Father’ by one person, ‘Brother’ by another and ‘Uncle’ by another. Then when that person goes to the office, he is called by his surname. When he mixes with his friends, they will call him by his given name. He is the same person but he is addressed in different ways, according to one’s connection with him. Similarly, God is also addressed in various ways, according to one’s sweetest, most affectionate feeling, Instead of using the word ‘God’, I use the word ‘Supreme’ most of the time. I ask my disciples to do the same, for I feel it gives us a more intimate connection with Him. Of course, only spiritual Masters can know the difference between these highest spiritual Realities. Many people may ask me, “Why do you have to separate ‘God’ and the ‘Supreme'? They are just synonyms.” But although God and the Supreme are one, there is a subtle distinction between the two. The highest Supreme is different from what we call God. When we speak of God-realisation, here ‘God’ is synonymous with the Supreme. But usually when we say ‘God’, we feel that He embodies a height which is static. He is like a mountain that is high, but flat. When we use the term ‘God’, we feel that He has reached His Height and stopped. He does not have a constantly evolving Consciousness; He is something finished, a finished product. But when we say ‘Supreme’, we are speaking of the Supreme Lord who not only reaches the absolute Highest, but all the time goes beyond, beyond and, transcends the Beyond. There is a constant upward movement.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The power of the creation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The power of the creation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sometimes we see that the creation becomes more powerful than the Creator. It is we who have created the hydrogen bomb and the atom bomb. Our human society has discovered them. But what is the good of our achievement if the creation becomes more powerful than we are?</p>
<p>Someone once said, “If we want destruction, that is up to us.” But if we feel that the power of destruction is greater than the power of God-realisation, then we are making a mistake. The power of destruction has come from whom? From the Source of creation. And who is the Source? God. He who first created us is undoubtedly more powerful than His creation or our creation because if He had not created the individual, then the individual could not have created anything else.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Is God’s power limited?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Is God’s power limited?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The other day a young friend of mine asked me why God had not yet made the whole world spiritual after so many thousands of years. “Is God’s Power limited,” he asked, “or does He not choose to make the world spiritual?” I wish to say that God’s Power is unlimited, but it is we who do not want to become spiritual. That is to say, earth does not want God’s Light.</p>
<p>God is wise, infinitely wiser than we are. Someone with less power than God can force another individual to do something that he does not want to do. But God does not force anyone to do anything. He feels that if He uses force, then we cannot get the ultimate Joy. You can force someone to eat but inwardly he will curse you. God only says, “My child, I am telling you to eat this for your good. If you eat this food, you will get nourishment. Then you will be strong and you will be able to fight against ignorance.” God offers His Light, His inner nourishment, but he does not force anyone to accept it. This is what His policy is.</p>
<p>God sees the past, the present and the future. He knows that the right thing will be for Him to constantly offer us His Wisdom and infinite Patience. Human beings do not have patience and they feel that by striking their child, by forcing him, they are doing the best thing. But when this child grows up, he will only want to strike his parents in return. Right now he is innocent, he is helpless. If the father beats his son, the child will remember this very incident. He may leave home at an early age and have nothing to do with his parents. Or when he becomes an adolescent he will play tit for tat: you struck me, now I will strike you. This is what happens when the human parents misuse their power.</p>
<p>But God the Father will not act in this way. He will only show abundant Compassion, infinite Compassion. Then in return His child will eventually offer infinite gratitude to God for showing His infinite Compassion-Light. The child will receive this Light and he will try to become worthy of his Father. When Compassion works, when Light works, then Wisdom works. If you offer wisdom to someone, then in ten or twenty years that person will also want to offer you wisdom when he himself has achieved it.</p>
<p>God will never give anything untimely. That would be like plucking an unripe fruit from a tree, thinking that it will be most delicious. If you eat it before it is ripe, it will taste deplorable. You always have to wait for it to ripen. Similarly, if somebody is fast asleep and you go and tell him that it is time for him to get up when actually it is only time for you to get up, then he will just kick you and you will feel miserable. He will say, “What are you doing? It is all well and good for you to get up. You do whatever you want to do. It is time for me to sleep.” Sleep is what is giving him joy. You are powerless at that time.</p>
<p>Look at the power of a Justice of the Supreme Court when he is in his office. Again, when this same man is with his wife and children, he cannot exercise this kind of power. His own son won’t listen to him. He may ask his son to bring him a glass of water and his son won’t do it. The Supreme Court Justice and the father are one and the same person. But when he is in court, the whole nation listens to him; whereas at home his own children won’t listen to him.</p>
<p>When in Heaven, the Supreme is really the Highest and at the same time He is constantly transcending Himself. The Supreme has that kind of supreme Power in the inner world. But when He wants to operate here on earth with His children, He has infinite Patience. He becomes one with their ignorance. He says, “All right, if you want to disobey Me, if you want to play these kinds of silly games, then let Me also play a little with you.”</p>
<p>You may ask how God manifests His Power in man. I wish to say that He manifests not only Power but all His other qualities through Love. God uses Power, but he prefers to manifest Himself through Love, Concern and Compassion.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God’s Goodness versus God’s Justice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God’s Goodness versus God’s Justice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some people feel that God’s Justice is more prominent than His Goodness. But I wish to say that the greater attribute of God is Goodness, not Justice; and this Goodness is His real inner Wisdom. God knows what to do and when to do it, or what role He should play at each stage of our evolving consciousness.</p>
<p>Our soul’s journey proceeded from the mineral kingdom to the plant kingdom and then we entered into the animal kingdom. Now we are human beings; however, we are little better than animals. We have to know that animals are inside God’s very Heart; destructive forces are also inside Him. The human forces and the divine forces are also there. What is happening? The destructive forces are not being punished or destroyed; gradually, gradually they are being transformed into divine forces. If we look at the animal kingdom, we see it is all quarrelling and fighting. We human beings are not fighting so badly, so we are already transformed to some extent.</p>
<p>Again, in God’s creation there is still evil. But what we call evil is in this case something unaspiring. What a spiritual aspirant calls bad may be relatively good compared to what an unaspiring person calls bad. What we call error is a half-truth, a harbinger of truth. Always we have to see it that way. A child is imperfect and he does many things wrong. With our ordinary human understanding, with our justice-power, we may say that he is the devil incarnate. But this child, when he is fifteen or sixteen years old, will continue to develop. He will become nice, sweet, meritorious and wise. So we have to remember that the child is still growing up.</p>
<p>If we separate ourselves from God or say that all His activity is based on Justice, then we will be making a mistake. If He were to act only according to His Justice, then nobody would be able to stay on earth, nobody would or could exist if God stands in front of us and weighs how many good things we have done against how many bad things we have done, then we will see that there will be infinitely more bad things than good things. Nobody would be able to realise God. So what is God actually doing? He is dealing with His Compassion and inside His Compassion is His Wisdom-Light. He is showing Compassion to someone who is now in the process of evolving because He knows that the person will grow spiritually and will eventually do the right thing, the divine thing. Inside His Compassion, Wisdom-Light is operating. Gradually, gradually He will be able to take the person to His infinite Light. If He started with Justice, immediately he would stand before us with an iron rod and strike us. But that He would never do. He gives us only Compassion.</p>
<p>So if you ask, “What is God?” then I will say that God is all Love. And inside this Love, if you see Justice, you have to know what kind of Justice it is. If a child is only a few months old, then his mother will give him milk or some other liquid. She will not give him a big piece of meat or something very solid and heavy because he will not be able to digest it. Even though these solid foods may be more delicious and may give the child more pleasure, the mother cannot feed them to her child because he is too young. As the child grows, gradually the mother can give him these things.</p>
<p>When we see that someone is not getting enough Peace, Light or Bliss, we have to feel that God is giving to him according to the capacity of his receptivity. God is always doing justice to the inferior one, to the one who is still in a preliminary stage. But at the same time He is all Love for that person. God does not want his inner vessel to burst untimely. So if you ask, “Why is God not playing His Game justly? Why is He giving so much Peace and Power to one person and not to another?” the answer is that one person is not ready. Whatever God is giving to each person is a sign of His Love. He will say, “You are My infant, My child, and I can give you this much. This is what is required.” If God gives him more than that He may ruin the inner progress of that individual. But the one who is given more has the capacity to receive it, to embody it and to fulfil it.</p>
<p>So the most important attribute of God is Love. And when it takes an intimate form, it is called Compassion. This Compassion is the most powerful attribute, the most significant attribute of God, and not His Justice. Justice and all other divine qualities will be found inside Compassion.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Does God get angry?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Does God get angry?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Does God ever become angry with us? No, God does not become angry with us. When our vital makes mistakes, it makes us feel that naturally God is displeased with us. If your son does something wrong, then your immediate reaction is to get angry with him. So we see God through our own eyes. We feel that God also acts as we do. But God does not use anger-power. He uses two other powers instead. One is called Compassion, the other is called Justice. Occasionally He uses His Justice-Power, but ninety-nine times out of one hundred He uses His Compassion Power. Even if we keep doing the same thing wrong. He forgives us and shows His Compassion.</p>
<p>There comes a time when God feels that His Compassion-Power is not working. At that time He uses His Justice-Power. But this Justice-Power is not like animal anger-power that wants to destroy us. No! God is only offering His Determination and divine Will Power to us when we have done something wrong. He energises us, inspires us. But very often when we see God’s adamantine Will Power, which is very strong, our guilty consciousness makes us think that God is angry with us. But at that time God is expressing His Compassion in the form of tremendous Will Power so that we won’t repeat the same mistake.</p>

<p>All people on earth have suffered and are suffering because they ask God for poison. When they pray, unconsciously they think that what they are asking for is all nectar. Then when they become more conscious, that very thing they think of as poison. The greater the awakening we have, the greater our realisation that hundreds of times we have prayed to God for poison, but out of his infinite Compassion He has not given us poison.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God Is the Doer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God Is the Doer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The world is full of suffering, pain and ignorance. Since God has created us, we say, “Let us put all the blame on Him; it is His fault. God created rascals like me on earth; let me blame Him.” But do we get any satisfaction by blaming, insulting and finding fault with God? Instead, let us try to see if there is any meaning, if there is any purpose in the world.</p>
<p>To do this, we shall first ask the physical. But the physical won’t be able to answer. Then we shall ask the vital. But the vital also won’t be able to answer. Then we shall ask the mind. instead of answering, the mind will only create infinite confusion. Finally we shall ask the heart. Unfortunately, if the vital enters into the heart, then the heart will not be able to answer adequately. But if the heart remains pure, then the heart will be able to tell us that there is some purpose. What that purpose is, the heart won’t be able to say. The soul will tell us that God is evolving in and through the world. He is the sufferer and He is the enjoyer; again, He does not suffer at all. He is enjoying Himself in countless ways in His divine Game of Manifestation.</p>
<p>If some result is not according to our satisfaction, we shall not blame God, nor shall we blame others. We shall not even blame ourselves. We will only say that we did what we could and that this is the experience that God has given us. In life there can be only one of two experiences: success or failure. If we take both failure and success cheerfully, then we get a real divine experience. Experience is what we need. If we do something good, often we expect something good. If we do something bad, we are always worried that something bad will come to us as a horrifying experience. From now on, if we play our role divinely, we can easily be detached while being full of concern. But if we don’t play our role divinely, then no matter what the result of our action may be, in God’s Eyes we will not be successful.</p>
<p>We make mistakes and the world also makes mistakes; that is why we suffer. Now, when we do something, let us be clever and say that we are not the doer; somebody else is the doer. If we have to put all the blame on God, let us do it in this way. Then let us make our heart wide, magnanimous. Tomorrow, when we feel that our enemy has done something wrong, we will say, “No, it is not he who has done it; it is God.” Your enemy is not to be blamed.</p>
<p>In that way we shall not blame ourselves and we shall not blame others who are doing wrong things. We shall put all the blame on God. In a few months’ time, we will notice that there are many good things that we do. Unconsciously we do many bad things and unconsciously we do many good things. When we do good things and also when others do good things, we shall say that it is God who has done it. When others do something good, it is so easy to say at that time that a third person has done it. Now that third person is God. So in this way we shall let God be responsible for our bad actions and good actions and for others good and bad actions also. We will see that God is not only the Doer of our good and bad deeds, but also the Doer of others’ good and bad deeds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God and evil</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God and evil" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God is in everything, but we have to know that here on earth everything is relative. God is in filthy water, God is in poison, but if we drink it we will die. God is in everything, but God has also given us wisdom. We have to use our brain, our own conscious judgement.</p>
<p>In the field of evolution, everything is proceeding toward a better, more fulfilling and more illumining existence. We started our evolutionary journey with limited knowledge. God was at one time inside our mineral life, plant life and our animal life. He is now in our human life. And when we lead a divine life, He will be there too. We are in the process of evolution, marching and running towards the highest Truth. When we were animals, at that time we used to kill and destroy, we used to do many wrong things. But according to the animal standard, we were perfect because the very nature of animals is to destroy. God was at that time in us, but now as human beings we are trying to lead better lives. We feel that evil has more than played its role in our past. This so-called evil was necessary for a particular period, but now we feel the time has come to transcend our animal nature We are moving away from ignorance and entering into wisdom. God was in that very ignorance and now God is acting through our evolving wisdom, our knowledge. God is above evil and good.</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, there is no such thing as evil. What we call evil is actually error. In our strict Indian philosophy, we do not use the term evil: we call it bondage or error. This error can be a pathfinder. When we get a little more knowledge in comparison to our old standard, we discard our former understanding as evil or ignorance. Let us say we get a thorn in our foot. We feel that this thorn is evil, but we need another thorn in order to remove the first thorn. Then we discard both thorns.</p>
<p>Once error starts its journey, it makes mistakes right and left like a mad elephant running amuck. But this elephant will one day calm down. Today what we call error, tomorrow that very thing we can transform on the strength of our own inner urge to see and grow into something more perfect, more divine.</p>
<p>From the strict spiritual point of view there is no evil, only experiences, limited experiences, the experiences that bind us. Now we are trying to transcend these experiences and have only divine, liberating experiences, experiences that expand and enlarge our consciousness. We are in the process of inner evolution: we are growing out of desire and entering into aspiration. When we go beyond the barriers of desire and enter into the domain of aspiration, we see that God is in everything and, at the same time, He is beyond both good and evil.</p>

<p>What can we do for God Almighty? We can offer Him all our outer wealth as well as our inner wealth. When we offer Him both our outer and inner wealth, we see that He immediately gives us His Wealth in infinite measure. If early in the morning we offer to God just one divine thought, one pure thought, He will immediately give us thousands of divine thoughts to spend daily.</p>
<p>This is our inner wealth that we are offering. But how can we offer Him our outer wealth? When we are doing even the most minor, insignificant act, such as sharpening our pencil, we should feel that the capacity we have for sharpening the pencil, for utilising our hands to hold the pencil, has come directly from God. When we dedicate all our outer actions to God, this capacity we are giving back to God directly This is our outer wealth in the form of capacity, which we can give to God. When we do this for minor activities, immediately we see that God gives us infinitely more power when we enter into more complicated, more meaningful, more purposeful activities.</p>

<p>If we know that something exists, then for us that thing is real. If we cannot feel its existence, then to us it is unreal. During our meditations we try to feel the Peace of God. We are trying and we are crying to bring down inner Peace because inside the inner Peace is God’s Reality. We can see, feel and grow into this Reality only when we are in the sea of Peace. It is Peace that is the Mother and Father, Brother and Sister of God. So if we can have Peace, then we are not only getting God, but all God’s relatives as well.</p>

<p>God is Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent. He has various kinds of power, but His greatest adamantine Power is His Grace. The moment God uses His Grace for an individual, He offers His very Life-Breath to the seeker, for God and God’s Grace can never be separated. Whenever we think of God, if we feel that it is through His Grace that we are approaching Him, then we can be most successful in receiving Him.</p>
<p>The Divine Grace is constantly descending upon us. Those who are sincerely aspiring are conscious of this Divine Grace, but those who are not aspiring are keeping their heart’s door permanently closed. If we feel that God is Grace, then we shall see that His infinite qualities, Peace, Light and Bliss, are already in the process of entering into us, ceaselessly flowing in and through us and becoming part and parcel of our inner and outer life. We have only to allow the flow of Grace to carry us into the Source, which is God.</p>
