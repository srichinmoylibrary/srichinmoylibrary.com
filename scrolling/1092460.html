<p><em>(King Vishwamitra and a group of attendants and admirers are in the forest. They are returning to the palace after hunting. On their way they see the cottage of the great sage Vashistha and decide to pay him a short visit. Vashistha welcomes the King and his party.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Your Majesty, you are tired. You are exhausted. You are thirsty. You are hungry.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: O sage, you are perfectly right. But this is not the place where I could expect anything, let alone food. Your poverty beggars description.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: I see, Your Majesty, I see.</p>
<p><em>(Vashistha enters into his hermitage and comes back with a large quantity of milk. The King and his attendants are wonder-struck.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Let me serve the King. You all serve yourselves, please.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA <em>(after drinking):</em> Ah, my thirst is quenched. The milk is most delicious. O sage, where did you get this milk?</p>
<p>VASHISTHA <em>(smiling):</em> King, I shall tell you later on.</p>
<p><em>(The sage enters into his hermitage and comes out with a most delicious meal — a variety of dishes. The King and his attendants are simply amazed.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Your Majesty, let me serve you. <em>(To the others.)</em> You all serve yourselves, please.</p>
<p><em>(While all are eating, Vashistha chants.)</em></p>
<p>Aum</p>

<p>Purnam adah purnam idam<br /> Purnat purnam udacyate<br /> Purnasya purnam adaya<br /> Purnam evavashisyate</p>
<p>[Infinity is that.<br /> Infinity is this.<br /> From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence.<br /> From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away,<br /> Infinity remains.]</p>

<p>VISHWAMITRA: O sage, God made a mistake. He didn't give me an ear for music. But he has made me a really practical man. Please tell me the source of your milk and all the food that you have offered us just now.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Ah, don't you know the source, my source, my only source?</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: I am all curiosity. For God's sake, do not exploit my patience!</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Your Majesty, yonder you see my Nandini.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: That cow?</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Yes. To you she is just an ordinary cow. But to me, my Nandini is my all. She gives me everything I need. She is my protection. She is my salvation. She is my perfection.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: O sage, you may stop now. Everybody knows that Vashistha is a wise sage. I wish you to be wiser. And it is I who can make you so.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: O King, do make me wiser. I really want to be wiser than I am now.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: I can make you infinitely wiser, this very day. Look, you are pure, but poor. You are pure, but obscure. Vashistha, you love your cow. The cow is your daughter. Now, don't you want the entire world to appreciate and admire your child? I am the mightiest King on earth. Thousands and thousands of people come to my palace. They all will adore your Nandini. And you need not feel sorry, for I shall give you one thousand cows in return. Only let me have your Nandini.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Impossible.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: I shall give you anything you want: money, property, name, fame, whatever you want, in the twinkling of an eye. Just let me have your cow.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Impossible.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Sage, you are a fool! Enough of your audacity. Don't exploit my patience. Don't exploit my compassion. Must I unseal your ears so that you can hear from others about my powers? Don't you know that there is no human being on earth who is not at my express command? How dare you defy me! You don't deserve my earnest request. You deserve, rightly deserve, my lofty contempt. Your audacity knows no bounds. Therefore I shall give you nothing, absolutely nothing ! Vashistha, I am taking your cow away!</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Impossible.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra commands his attendants to seize the cow. Nandini charges Vishwamitra's men with such force that they all run for their lives.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: I am disappointed, I am disheartened.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: And badly defeated.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Defeat! No defeat. Vishwamitra never accepts defeat. Victory, here, there, everywhere that is my name! I am going back to my palace. Soon I shall be back with my indomitable force, and then I shall take your Nandini away.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Impossible.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA You fool! You are the worst fool I have met in this incarnation. <em>(Addressing the heavens.)</em> God, this fool has no equal on earth. Anyway, Vashistha, I shall be back soon. In the meantime drink milk from your Nandini to your heart's content, for this will undoubtedly be the last chance for you to enjoy her milk</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Impossible.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: The entire world knows that I am a man of action, immediate action. Your vast ignorance does not permit you to recognize who I am. I don't blame you, but I do blame your ignorance.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra hurriedly leaves the hermitage followed by his attendants.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Vashistha and Nandini.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Nandini, your mother is Kamadhenu, the cow that fulfils all desires, earthly and heavenly. She has blessed you with her infinite capacities. You are now blessing me. You fulfil all my wishes. You are my everything.</p>
<p>NANDINI: Master, my Lord, you are my all. To serve you, to please you, to fulfil you, I came into the world. Your aspiration and realisation are fulfilling the Supreme in a unique manner. You are His chosen son. You are His colossal pride.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Nandini, the King will soon come back with a very large force. And then, God alone knows.</p>
<p>NANDINI: O greatest sage, like God, you and I know perfectly well that I am going to defeat the King easily. I shall produce an army infinitely more powerful than the army of King Vishwamitra. I shall smash his pride. He has told you that this time he will take me away. I assure you that I shall make him touch your hallowed feet. He must and he will.</p>
<p><em>(Enter suddenly Vishwamitra with a very large army.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Vashistha, so — are you ready? Death is inviting you and your cow!</p>
<p><em>(Immediately Nandini produces a most powerful army. A battle ensues in which the whole army of King Vishwamitra is destroyed by Nandini's army. Only the King is left alive.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Forgive me, O sage, forgive me. You are my life's only haven. My army is gone. Helpless, hopeless and meaningless my life now is. Once again I implore your loftiest bounty.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra prostrates himself before Vashistha. Vashistha places his right palm on Vishwamitra's devoted head.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: O King, I forgive you. My Nandini forgives you. Ask for any boon; I shall grant it immediately.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: What need have I for any boon from you right now? Once I was the mightiest King and now, without my army, I am nothing. My life is worse than useless. Glory gone. Pride gone. What remains is a sea of tears.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Nothing is gone. I give you all back.</p>
<p><em>(Vashistha sprinkles sacred water on the dead bodies of Vishwamitra's soldiers. Life is restored. Once again they are ready to fight against Nandini's soldiers. Vishwamitra's joy and pride now know no bounds. Once more he challenges Nandini. In a few minutes' time Nandini again destroys Vishwamitra's whole army. Vishwamitra's life is at her mercy.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA <em>(to Vashistha):</em> You have conquered me with your spiritual power. Our physical strength and military strength are no match for your spiritual strength. But listen, Vashistha, listen. I tell you I shall utterly smash your pride before long. I shall launch into the life of spirituality. I shall give up my palace, my Kingdom and all that I have. I shall practise austerities. I shall meditate day in and day out until I have reached my Transcendental Goal. I shall transcend your highest height. I, Vishwamitra, accept no permanent defeat. God in Heaven is my witness!</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Vishwamitra, in the realm of the Spirit, rivalry cannot live. If or when you transcend my spiritual height I shall garland you. I shall adore you. I shall worship you.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Action, action! I am a man of action. I don't talk, I don't preach, I just act. Today I touched your feet. Tomorrow I shall make you touch my feet. I shall cross the sea of ignorance-dream. I shall face the One Absolute alone. And then I shall see you, Vashistha, kissing the dust of my feet.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA <em>(raising his right hand in the form of benediction): Tathastu:</em> so be it.</p>
<p><em>(Nandini bursts into roaring laughter.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exit Vishwamitra)</em></p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Nandini, my child, Vishwamitra has at last left us. What shall we do now? Shall we eat or shall we meditate?</p>
<p>NANDINI: My Lord, let us meditate first and then eat.</p>
<p>VASHISTHA: Fine, my child, that's a splendid idea.</p>
<p><em>(Both Vashistha and Nandini start meditating. Light and delight are sporting in their eyes. Enter a divine messenger from the Supreme.)</em></p>
<p>MESSENGER: O peerless sage, the Supreme has sent me to you with a most special message: Vishwamitra in the distant future will become a sage. But your highest height he will never be able to transcend. The Supreme treasures your life on earth. You are His best instrument on earth. With you and through you He is manifesting His Divinity's Height and Immortality's Light on earth. <em>(Turning to Nandini.)</em> Nandini, the Supreme is highly pleased with you. With His infinite Love, Infinite Joy and infinite Pride, He unites the breath of your most devoted service to the life of your master's dedicated surrender.</p>
<p><em>(Exit messenger)</em></p>
<p><em>(Nandini sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Tumi amai diyechha aj</em><br /><em>Samarpaner bani</em><br /><em>Ami tomai sapechhi mor</em><br /><em>Kusum hriday khani</em><br /><em>Andhar rate ashru sathe</em><br /><em>Moher karar ajanate</em><br /><em>Simar gehe thakbona ar</em><br /><em>Jani ami jani</em><br /><em>Tumi amar jenechhi ma</em><br /><em>Chirantaner rani</em></p>


<p>[Today You have given me<br /> the message of surrender.<br /> I have offered to You my very flower-heart.<br /> In the dark night with tears,<br /> In the unknown prison-cell of illusion,<br /> In the house of the finite,<br /> No longer shall I abide.<br /> I know You are mine.<br /> I have known this, Mother,<br /> O Queen of the Eternal.]</p>

<p><em>(King Uttanpada's palace. The King is seated on his golden throne. Around him is a vast audience. Suruchi's son, Uttama, comes and sits on his father's lap. Uttanpada begins to caress him. Seeing this from a distance, Dhruva comes running to sit on his father's lap, too. But he is caught and held back by his stepmother, Suruchi.)</em></p>
<p>SURUCHI: Dhruva, stop! You are such a fool! Don't you know that you are Suniti's son and not mine? How dare you approach your father? It is only my son who is permitted to sit on his lap. You must never dare to approach your father for kindness, affection or love. Only my son, Uttama, will have everything that your father has and is. You stay away from the King, Dhruva. I give you a last warning.</p>
<p><em>(King Uttanpada is totally indifferent to the situation. The audience is terribly shocked. Dhruva begins shedding bitter tears.)</em></p>
<p>SURUCHI: Dhruva, now get away from here. I don't want to see you anymore. You must know that it is my Uttama who is going to inherit his father's regal throne and not you! Never! Go and stay with your mother and don't come here. Don't bother us!</p>

<p><em>(Dhruva enters his mother's room. He is shaking with anger and, at the same time, crying with sorrow. His mother is all concern for him.)</em></p>
<p>DHRUVA: Mother, Suruchi has badly scolded and insulted me. I was going to my father, but she held me back. She said I had no right to approach my father for affection and love because I am your son. She has insulted me and scolded me. She said it is <em>her</em> son who is going to inherit my father's throne and not me. She showed me such contempt, Mother, I can't tell you! She was so mean. She asked me to leave the place, and not to come near my father anymore. There were many, many people who saw me being insulted, but my father did not care at all. He did not say a word in my favour. Mother, what am I going to do with such a father and such a mean, cruel, nasty stepmother'?</p>
<p>SUNITI <em>(fondling her son):</em> Dhruva, my child, don't cry, don't weep, don't feel sad and miserable. God knows what is best for us. He will one day make us happy. He will really give us what we need most. You pray to God. Today you have been insulted by your stepmother. Well, I have been insulted by her since she came into your father's life. She insults me at every moment-mercilessly, without any cause. I too suffer, I cry within. And now that you have also been insulted, my dearest son, I feel my heart is broken. But what can I do? What can you do? Only God, the ever-compassionate Father, can put an end to our suffering. Let us pray to Him to give us joy and inner illumination. We shall see that our inner joy will infinitely surpass Suruchi's pleasure. Let us not enter into the world of competition, my son.I have been praying to God every day and, beginning today, I wish you to join me.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: Mother, I want to pray, I want to meditate, but I don't know how. I don't know anything about it.</p>
<p>SUNITI: My son, yonder is a forest. Go there and look around. You will find people praying and meditating. Ask them how to pray, how to meditate, how to invoke God — His Love and Light. They will teach you.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: Mother, is it true?</p>
<p>SUNITI: Yes, my son.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: Mother, I am off. I shall come back only when I have brought for you Joy, Delight and Blessings, all from Cod.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Dhruva)</em></p>
<p><em>(Suniti sheds soulful tears, while her only son leaves for the forest to pray to God.)</em></p>

<p>[The sky calls me,<br /> The wind calls me,<br /> The moon and the stars call me.<br /> The green and the dense groves call me,<br /> The dance of the fountain calls me,<br /> Smiles call me, tears call me.<br /> A faint melody calls me.<br /> The morn, noon and eve call me.<br /> Everyone is searching for a playmate,<br /> Everyone is calling me, "Come, come!"<br /> One voice, one sound, all around.<br /> Alas, the Boat of Time sails on.]</p>

<p><em>(Finally Dhruva comes to a spot where he sees seven sages meditating together. Most humbly he bows down before them.)</em></p>
<p>DHRUVA: Dear sirs, please help me. I am looking for someone to teach me to pray and meditate.</p>
<p>FIRST SAGE: We shall help you, we shall teach you. But before that, tell us who you are and what brings you here.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: My name is Dhruva. My father is King Uttanpada and my mother is Suniti. This morning my stepmother, Suruchi, insulted me so cruelly, so brutally, so unbearably. She said that my brother, Uttama, will inherit the throne.</p>
<p>SECOND SAGE: So you want to inherit your father's throne. Is that your prayer? Is that why you have come into the forest?</p>
<p>DHRUVA: No, certainly not! I don't want my father's throne. I want to have joy and inner happiness that will forever last. I want to share with my mother that kind of joy. My mother has taught me that earthly possessions have no value. Let Uttama have my father's throne; let him have everything from his Kingdom. I do not need earthly possessions to make me happy. I wish only to see the Feet of God; I wish to realise Him. I wish to be eternally happy, divinely happy, supremely happy.</p>
<p>THIRD SAGE: We are so pleased with you, Dhruva. We shall help you.</p>
<p>FOURTH SAGE: You have to pray from now on to Lord Vishnu. It is he who will be able to grant you the boon. He will be able to make you the happiest man on earth and your mother the happiest woman on earth.</p>
<p>FIFTH SAGE: We shall teach you how to pray to him, how to meditate on him.</p>
<p>SIXTH SAGE: Your sincerity, your inner cry for God, your true love of God, have given us tremendous joy and we offer your our blessingful pride.</p>
<p>DHRUVA <em>(again bowing down to the seven sages with deepest gratitude):</em> O divine sages, then please teach me how to pray and how to meditate.</p>
<p>LEADER OF THE SAGES: Come and sit in front of me, Dhruva. Dhruva, this is how you will pray. You will pray to the Lord Vishnu: "O Lord Vishnu, I wish to please you, I wish to serve you, I wish to become totally, unconditionally yours." And this is how you will meditate: you will not allow any thought to enter into your mind; you will keep your mind absolutely free from thoughts and ideas. Only try to feel all the time within your heart the lotus-feet of Lord Vishnu. This is how you should pray and how you should meditate. Your prayer and your meditation will undoubtedly bring Lord Vishnu right before you. He will bless you with his infinite affection, with his infinite compassion, love, joy and pride. If you pray and meditate, in the near future you are bound to see him and your desire, your aspiration, is sure to be fulfilled. You are a young boy. You have been mistreated by your stepmother, your father has been indifferent to you, your mother has been suffering for a long time and you are dissatisfied with this world. When your aspiration is fulfilled your whole being will be flooded with joy, eternal joy. You and your mother will be the perfect instruments of God on earth. With our blessings go to pray and meditate over there. That place is called <em>Madhuvana,</em> the honey-forest. You pray and meditate there and from here we shall keep our conscious concern on you. We shall think of you and meditate on your divine, supreme success. Now go and pray over there. <em>Madhuvana</em> is most beautiful and most inspiring.</p>
<p><em>(Dhruva bows to the leader of the sages, then to the other six sages with utmost humility and gratitude.)</em></p>
<p>DHRUVA: O sages, O seekers of the highest magnitude, O greatest lovers of God, my whole existence is grateful to you.</p>
<p><em>(All the sages bless Dhruva with utmost joy and pride and Dhruva departs.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Dhruva is now in the Madhuvana practicing severe austerities. He is determined not to eat anything until he sees the lotus-feet of Lord Vishnu. As his aspiration is increasing his inner strength is increasing too. The mountains and meadows are shaking before him with reverential awe. His power of meditation is frightening. The earth itself it wonder-struck. The dwellers in Heaven are all extremely worried. They feel that if this is the way Dhruva prays and meditates, then his power will soon far exceed their own. Indra and Yama meet together. They want to put an end to Dhruva's penance, his austere life, his overwhelming power of meditation. They want to play a trick on Dhruva. With their occult power they take the form of Dhruva's mother, Suniti, and enter into the grove of Madhuvana. Dhruva is in deep trance.)</em></p>
<p>"SUNITI:" My son, I have found you at last. I am totally lost without you. It was your presence that gave me joy; it was your presence that made my life worth living on earth. In your absence I have no one to think of me, no one to protect me, no one to care for me. Feel your mother's heart, Dhruva. I need you. Come back with me, my son. Now that you know how to pray and meditate, come back to the palace with me. You can meditate there.</p>
<p><em>("Suniti" sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Madhuman me parayanam</em><br /><em>Madhumat punarayanam</em></p>


<p>[Sweet be my departure from home.<br /> Sweet be my return.]</p>

<p>"SUNITI:" At home you can do everything you want to do. You will see the feet of Lord Vishnu. Dhruva, my darling, come. Come with me.</p>
<p>(Dhruva is in deep trance. He does not hear a word of his "mother's" affectionate, loving, commanding voice.)</p>
<p><em>(Exit "Suniti")</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Indra and Yama.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Since Indra and Yama failed in their first attempt, they bring all kinds of evil spirits and demons to destroy Dhruva totally.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter demons and rakshasas. They attack Dhruva.)</em></p>
<p>INDRA AND YAMA: Eat him up, eat him up! Kill him! Destroy him, destroy him! He will surpass us — a mortal, an insignificant creature! He will surpass us if we don't stop him from praying and meditating!</p>
<p><em>(Dhruva, still in deep trance, does not budge an inch. His gaze passes beyond, far beyond, into the very breath of the demons and rakshasas who leave in fear, frustration and disappointment.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Indra and Yama come before Lord Vishnu. They bow down to him.)</em></p>
<p>INDRA AND YAMA: O Lord, how is it that you are not fulfilling Dhruva's desire? Can you not grant his boon? His power of meditation will soon surpass all our spiritual power. We pray to you to save us. If you don't want to grant his boon, let us grant it. Let us go on your behalf. Let us go and please him.</p>
<p>LORD VISHNU: O Indra, O Yama, it is not so easy. You cannot fulfil Dhruva's aspiration; you cannot feel his heart. He is great, he is supremely great. But I shall fulfil him, and I shall fulfil your desires as well. I shall go and ask him to stop praying and meditating. Then you will be pleased. You will still have your enormous light and power, but my Dhruva will have a life, a world of his own.</p>
<p>INDRA: O Lord Vishnu, as long as he does not surpass me, I will be most grateful to you. I want nobody to surpass me; I want to be the Lord of the gods, the cosmic gods. I want to remain the most powerful one here in Heaven and there on earth.</p>

<p><em>(Dhruva is in deep meditation. His whole being is meditating on the lotus-feet of Lord Vishnu. His inner being is surcharged with supernatural power. Enter Lord Vishnu with his discus, Sudarshan Chakra, his mace and his conch, a diadem on his brow. He comes with his infinite glory and stands in front of Dhruva, his dearest and greatest devotee. He places his hands on Dhruva's devoted head. Dhruva opens his eyes with supreme astonishment. Immediately he touches the feet of Lord Vishnu.)</em></p>
<p>LORD VISHNU: My dearest, my fondest child Dhruva, I am the object of your prayer, I am the object of your meditation. I am most pleased with you; I am most proud of you. I have come here to fulfil your desires and your aspirations.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: My Lord, if you are really pleased with me, then you know what I want. I want only to be all the time at your lotus-feet. I am your child; I want to serve you.</p>
<p><em>(Lord Vishnu touches Dhruva's forehead with his conch. Immediately Dhruva receives inner illumination. All the supernal qualities, the infinite divine Light, Peace and Bliss of lord Vishnu enter into him.)</em></p>
<p>LORD VISHNU: Dhruva, my Dhruva, ask me for any boon. Immediately I shall grant it.</p>
<p>DHRUVA: O my Lord, my eternal Lord, you have given me everything I wanted. You have given me all that I wanted and beyond, far beyond my imagination's flight. What more do I need?</p>
<p>VISHNU: No, Dhruva, I want to give you something more. I want to give you a particular place of your own. Yours will be a divine station far above the earthly world. You will become one with the real Dhruva: <em>Dhruva Tara,</em> the pole-star. You will sustain all the stars and other planets in their course. You will guide the aspiring, seeking, struggling world. You will show the earth the world of Light and Delight. You will be the guiding light, the pole-star. It is with you that the earth-consciousness will enter into my life of infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. Dhruva, I bring your mother back into your heart. It was she who advised you to pray to God; it was she who inspired you to come into the forest and meditate. Today all her sufferings have come to an end. In you your mother will have her supreme glory and satisfaction. Also, I bring before you the seven sages who inspired you, who helped you, who taught you how to pray and meditate. Dhruva, you have far surpassed them now. They will be all joy, all pride for you because they want someone on earth to be supremely divine, supremely unconditional, supremely great. They want someone to be my most perfect instrument, and they will now see in you my supreme manifestation.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Suniti who, seeing her dearest son, is overwhelmed with delight. She touches Lord Vishnu's feet, then sits beside her son with enormous joy and pride, shedding tears of gratitude to Lord Vishnu.)</em></p>
<p>SUNITI: O Lord Vishnu, you have heard my son's prayers. You are our own, our very own. Each breath of ours, each heartbeat of ours is for you.</p>
<p><em>(Vishnu offers her his brightest smile. Then the seven sages enter. Seeing Dhruva, they are overwhelmed with joy, delight and pride. One by one they touch the feet of Lord Vishnu and Dhruva.)</em></p>
<p>ALL THE SAGES: Dhruva, long long before you were born we were praying to Lord Vishnu to see his lotus-feet. It is you who have brought down into the world before us his presence, our cherished Goal. It is because of you that we are seeing the chosen object of our adoration today. It is your prayer and meditation that has brought our Lord Vishnu here. If not for you, centuries would have passed by and we would not have seen the lotus-feet of our Lord Supreme. It is because of you that today we can kiss the golden feet of our Lord Vishnu, the eternal Lord. Dhruva, Dhruva, our hearts are all gratitude, our lives are all gratitude, our realisation is all gratitude to you, to you, to you.</p>
