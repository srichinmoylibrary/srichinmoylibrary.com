  <h2 id="page-title">Buying a chair</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buying a chair" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We all know that the Japanese are very honest by nature. But I had a very un-Japanese kind of experience in Kyoto while we were buying a chair. In one shop the man said, "It is on sale, so I won't be able to reduce the price. This is the cheapest price in Japan, and you won't get this chair at a better price anywhere else." Kirit was the translator.</p>
<p>I looked at the man and then said to Kirit, "Let us go to some other store."Right across the street we found another chair that was just like the one in the first store, but it also had a footrest. In spite of that, it was six or seven thousand yen less than the first one. It was a better price and, in addition, it had a footrest! Kirit was so excited.</p>
<p>Later I told Kirit's mother, "Your son is a very, very good boy. I am very proud of him." But unfortunately, not all Japanese are like him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Lowering the price</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Lowering the price" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Kyoto I bargained with the shopkeepers. In one place I wanted to buy a particular game. As soon as I went there, they lowered the price. Even when you agree to pay the quoted price, they lower it.</p>
<p>It is the same in Okinawa. Today I bought a watch. As I was buying it, the man brought the price down five thousand yen. I am shameless. I said, "You have lowered it, but can you not lower it another two thousand?"</p>
<p>So altogether he lowered it seven thousand yen. He was such a nice man.</p>

<p>Then I bought something for A. The old lady in the store was very greedy! She quoted a price and wrote it down. Then I wrote down what I wanted to pay, and she agreed to it. I opened my wallet in front of her, and she started pointing to a large bill that she wanted me to give her. Something within me said not to give her so much, so I gave her some smaller bills. She was grumbling. When she wanted me to give her more, I said, "No, no, no!" Finally she agreed to take what I offered.</p>
<p>Chidananda was watching, and he was quite amused. He saw his Guru's bargaining capacity with the old lady.</p>

<p>Can you imagine! The Japanese have printed something totally incorrect on a T-shirt which is being sold in the stores. It says, "If you have freedom, then practical what you say."</p>
<p>Chidananda was reading it out, and he was automatically saying "practice." He did not realise that they had written "practical."</p>

<p>As soon as I put the first pair on, the man said, "Very nice, now you can read."I said, "I don't need glasses to read."</p>
<p>Then immediately my eyes started burning. I said, "They are very powerful. I don't need these."</p>
<p>The second pair also started giving me pain, so the man said, "You should go to an eye specialist."</p>

<p>I went to a bookstore and saw a book called <em>Who's Who in America.</em> My name is in a book called <em>Who's Who Among Indians in America,</em> so I was looking for my name in this one.</p>
<p>A very fat lady was looking for books to help her fight fatness. She said to me in a sarcastic way, "I'm sure your name is there!"</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to enter into conversation with her, so I just gave her a smile.</p>
<p>Thomas Chinmoy or somebody was mentioned in the book, but my name was not there. They didn't have anything under Ghose or Chinmoy. So I gave up.</p>

<p>I always have problems when I go shopping. The last time I went to a Christian bookstore to buy an inspirational book, the book that I wanted cost 50 cents. I don't like to carry much change with me because it makes my pockets very heavy. So I had a quarter and three dimes. I gave the man 55 cents for the book, and he said, "Thank you very much." He was thanking me for the extra nickel I gave him. This time, in the same store, I wanted to buy a book called "Flying with the Birds." It is about people who follow birds in a boat. You can't imagine how hard they work, according to the book. Some people don't care for God-realisation; they are only crying for the birds.</p>
<p>The price of the book was 50 cents. This time I had three quarters in my pocket, so I gave the exact amount. The lady took my 50 cents, but this time I didn't even get a "thank you."</p>

<p>Once I was running in Florida in the early morning when I saw a store that advertised "All T-shirts $2.99." They even mentioned some very good brands. But the store was not yet open.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I went there again to run. This time the store was open. I said to myself, "Let me buy quite a few T-shirts for $2.99." Then I thought, "I have to run. Why take so many T-shirts? I will buy one now and send Savyasachi back for more later."</p>
<p>I gave the saleslady $5.00 and stood waiting for my change. She was looking at me like I was an idiot.</p>
<p>I said, "It is $2.99."</p>
<p>She said, "No, that is a very old sign."</p>
<p>As I was going out, I saw some old men looking at the sign-$2.99.I did not have the heart to tell them that the sign was false.</p>
<p>I was so disgusted that I ran home very fast!</p>

<p>In Florida Savyasachi and I went to a famous bird store, but I have more of a variety in my house. They had only six or eight kinds of birds, but of each kind they had hundreds. What shall I do with number? I was looking for variety.</p>
<p>The lady asked, "Do you have cash? We take only cash."</p>
<p>Savyasachi said, "Yes, we have cash."</p>
<p>Then the lady said, "If you don't buy at least $300 worth, you have to pay a penalty of $25." Now, am I stupid enough to buy $300 worth of birds just to save $25?</p>
<p>We saw some beautiful lovebirds. I wanted to buy one or two. The lady said again, "Mind you, it is cash!"</p>
<p>Then I got disgusted and said, "I am not going to buy it."</p>
<p>The lady looked at me as though to say, "I was right. You don't have cash!" She didn't know it was because I was disgusted with her.</p>

<p>In one area of a variety store I saw a chandelier for $10, and nearby was a very tiny koala bear. There was no price anywhere on the koala bear, but since it was in the same place as the chandelier, I thought perhaps everything in that area was $10. So I decided to buy the koala bear, and I gave the lady $10.</p>
<p>She said, "It is $13. Can't you see the price?"</p>
<p>I said, "It doesn't have a price." I really got disgusted. She was so rude.</p>
<p>She looked at me and said, "All right, you can have it for $11."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "I am not going to get it," and I walked away. But then I thought; "These are very old people. Perhaps they are senile." So I went back again.</p>
<p>When I went back in, the lady said to her husband, "There! I told you he was going to come back."</p>
<p>Again I got disgusted. I said, "I am only going to buy the chandelier, not the koala bear."</p>

<p>The last time I was in Florida, in the same shop, a young salesman asked me if I could afford the thing I was looking at, which cost nineteen dollars. This time I spent a hundred thirty dollars or even more. I will sign the handkerchiefs and give them to the disciples.</p>
