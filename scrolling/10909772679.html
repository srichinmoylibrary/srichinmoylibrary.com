But we have to keep coming back to get refilled. How much of the Light which you give us remains permanently in us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on how long you maintain the consciousness that you feel here. When you go back to your office, you can totally forget about what you have done here for one hour. Or you can remain conscious of the Peace, Light and Joy that you felt here even while you are typing or taking dictation. In this way you can keep the entire amount if you want to.</p>
<p>We sometimes say that a person is doing something, but his mind is somewhere else. Now, instead of the mind, let us say that the aspiring heart is not there. Your mind will take dictation from your boss, but your aspiring heart will keep its oneness with this room where it received Peace, Light and Bliss.</p>
<p>If you can maintain your inner connection with this divine consciousness until your early morning meditation tomorrow, then you will keep the full amount of Light that you have received from me. That doesn't mean that you can't talk to friends, or can't eat, or can't do any ordinary things. You can do these things, but you have to be careful not to lose your precious inner wealth. Once you have assimilated the Peace and Light that you have received into your inner system, it is safe. Before assimilation it can be lost. Even the full amount can be lost. If you go to your office now and enter into a quarrel or some unpleasant situation, not even an iota will remain. If you can keep it safe until your next serious meditation, then you are totally free from the possibility of robbery because your whole spiritual system will have assimilated it. But assimilation takes quite a few hours, so the Light that you receive has to be maintained through inspiration or through your conscious inner awareness until your next meditation. It depends on your inner awareness and your care in dealing with the outside world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to feel that you are helpless. As soon as you feel that you are helpless, somebody will come to help you. If a child is in the street, totally lost, if he begins to cry, some kind-hearted person will show him where his home is. In the inner world, your real home is your heart. Feel that you are lost in the street, and there is a storm raging outside — that means doubt, fear, anxiety, worry, insecurity are pouring down on you. But if you cry sincerely, somebody will come to rescue you. Somebody will show you how to get to your home, which is your heart. Your inner being is that somebody. This is the way to meditate. Cry inwardly. When you feel helpless, immediately your inner cry will take you to the place where you will get shelter, where you will get the things that you want — illumination, salvation, realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He who meditates has to act like a divine hero amidst humanity. Humanity is part and parcel of God. By throwing aside humanity, how are we going to reach divinity? We have to accept the world as it is now. If we don't accept a thing, how can we transform it? If a potter does not touch the lump of clay, how is he going to shape it into a pot? The world around us is not perfect, but we also are not perfect. Perfect perfection has not yet dawned. We have to know that humanity at present is far, far from perfection. But we are also members of that humanity. How are we going to discard our brothers and sisters who are our veritable limbs? I cannot discard my arm; it is impossible. Similarly, when we meditate soulfully, devotedly, we have to accept humanity as our very own. We have to take it with us. If we are in a position to inspire others, if we are one step ahead, then we have the opportunity to serve the divinity in the ones who are following us.</p>
<p>So we must not enter into the Himalayan caves. We have to face the world here and now. We have to transform the face of the world on the strength of our dedication to the divinity in humanity. Meditation is not an escape. Meditation is the acceptance of life in its totality with a view to transforming it for the highest manifestation of the divine Truth here on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people do enter into seclusion in order to realise God. They do not want to see God in humanity; they only want to see God above. They ignore and negate the world. They practise arduous spiritual disciplines all alone. Eventually they may realise God, the God who is in seclusion, but if their spiritual practice is not integrally done, they become arrogant to some extent.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. It is like many other things you might do. If you are a dancer, in the beginning, while you are learning how to dance, you will always be conscious of whether or not your steps are exactly the way they are supposed to be. But when you become an expert, the steps become almost spontaneous. You are dancing, and at the same time you are looking around and doing all sorts of things. In the beginning, when you are learning how to drive, you cannot do two things at once. You are always afraid that you will have an accident. But when you become an experienced driver, you look to this side and that, you talk to your friends, and do many other things. Similarly, when you become expert in the spiritual life, you can do many things simultaneously.</p>
<p>When my students were beginners, absolute beginners, they had the same problem. They used to say that while they were in the office typing something, for instance, only typing would exist for them. They could not meditate or think of the spiritual life. Now the stenographers and secretaries are remaining in a very high consciousness while they are typing or taking dictation from their bosses. Their bosses are surprised when they look at these girls. They think, "How is it that her face is shining with light?" It is because these particular girls are meditating while doing their work. In the beginning they could not do this, but they meditated systematically for six or eight months, and gradually they developed this capacity. It is only by practising every day that one becomes an expert.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that there is a vast difference between a truly spiritual person and one who goes to church to pray for a half hour, obtains some peace, and then goes to a cafeteria and there abandons his peace. It is only when one meditates for many hours and firmly establishes this practice that he will obtain lasting results. If you can enter into your inner world and remain there for some time during your meditation, then the day will come when your peace will remain undisturbed and constant even when you are in the outer world, talking and mixing with people.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the family man gets up early in the morning, what does he think of? He thinks of the members of his family, the education of his children and so forth. But before he allows these thoughts to enter into him, before he enters into activities, if he can meditate, if he can think of God for five or ten minutes, these few minutes will be of great benefit to him. Yes, he shoulders responsibilities; he has to think of his whole earthly family. But again, who shoulders the responsibility of the entire universe? Not he, not the members of his family, but God, God Himself.</p>
<p>If the head of the family meditates on God, on Light — for God means Light — then Light descends. It starts to decrease his worries and anxieties. When one concentrates, whatever he wants to do becomes easier. Similarly, if an individual who has many family problems meditates for five or ten minutes before he thinks of his family, it will immediately help him by reducing the difficulties he faces; also, the Light that he receives will operate in him. He does not have to meditate for ten or twelve hours. He knows that his progress may not necessarily be very fast; but slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>If you try to feel God every day, the living God, inside your children and the members of your family, then gradually you will see and feel Light operating within them. But people do not do that. They look upon their children as their possessions, and feel that they have every right to mould them and guide them according to their own sweet will. But if they can feel that they love their children and all the members of their family precisely because God is inside them, if they think of that and meditate on that, they are doing the best thing for their own and their family's spiritual progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can convince people through your own life, your own conduct. Just tell them, "Look at us. In the morning we meditate, in the evening we meditate. We live a life of meditation and aspiration, and we are perfectly normal. Do you see any difference between yourself and us? We also eat food; we also have eyes and legs and arms. But when you look at us you see a glow. It is not showing off. But when people look at us, they see something different, something unusual. That unusual thing we are getting by doing something that you have not added to your daily routine."</p>
<p>When they ask you what that particular thing is, you will say that it is meditation. You are using something natural and normal which they have not discovered. This natural, normal thing can be theirs as well, but they are not utilising it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During action, the best way to meditate is to remember to offer yourself, the action, and the result of the action to the Supreme. When you stop meditating and enter into the world of action, think of your action as a continuation of your meditation. When you meditate in silence, you go very high, very deep. And when you begin your daily activities, feel that this is another form of meditation which is called manifestation. Meditation in action is manifestation.</p>
<p>God has to occupy one's mind, and in this state of divine concentration, one should serve humanity. At that very hour, service itself becomes the greatest reward. In the field of spirituality, although meditation and concentration constitute a totally different approach, work and dedicated service are nothing short of pure meditation.</p>
<p>In all your activities try to feel the presence of God. While you are feeding your child, feel that you are not feeding your child but rather the God within him. While you are talking to someone, feel that you are talking to the Divinity within him. You need not go to your shrine and meditate on God with tears of devotion if at that very moment you have something most important to do in the outer world. Whatever you do, please try to think that you are given the opportunity to do that by God; think that you are doing something which is ultimately leading you towards your realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Some people are very absentminded and they seem to be in another world. Are they meditating all the time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Some people are very absentminded and they seem to be in another world. Are they meditating all the time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Absent-mindedness has nothing to do with the spiritual life. It is a Himalayan mistake to think that absentmindedness is due to aspiration. Many absent-minded people, of course, are not even aspiring. And those absent-minded people who are aspiring are not absent-minded because of their meditation. They may seem to be in another world because they neglect their duties, but they are not actually staying in a higher consciousness. In the spiritual life it is very important that we live in the outer world and do our best in the outer world. We should look upon the world and humanity as our very own. To allow ourselves to be absent-minded is to be rude and inconsiderate of others.</p>
<p>There are some spiritual Masters and very advanced seekers who appear to be absentminded and forgetful at times. But with them, it is a different story. At that time their consciousness is not in the physical. They are on a very high plane. Again, a few — very few — Masters can remain on this high plane and still function normally in the world.</p>
<p>But in the case of a beginner, a spiritual seeker, absent-mindedness is not aiding him in his spiritual journey. It is not a positive expression of his aspiration; it is a hindrance, an obstruction. He is running towards his Goal with a heavy load on his shoulders. After a few years, when he has made more progress, the seeker will realise that he is carrying this burden. He will feel that he cannot go any farther while carrying it, and his progress will come to a standstill. At that time the seeker makes every effort to transform his weakness, and finally sheds his heavy load so that he can continue towards his destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, you have to identify yourself with the standards of the person who is creating the irritation. Suppose you are in your office and somebody is creating unnecessary problems. If you get angry with him, that will not solve the problem. Instead, you will be tortured inwardly by your anger and outwardly by the person. If you allow yourself to become angry, you will only lose your own inner strength. But if you come down to the standard of that person and identify with him, you will see that he himself is very unhappy and therefore wishes consciously or unconsciously to make others unhappy as well. The moment you identify with the person who is creating the situation, you will see that there is nothing to be gained by irritation. Half of your irritation will go away. It will feel that half of its domain is now captured by something: identification. When you identify yourself with the lowest standard of the person who is creating this undivine disturbance in you, your presence inside that person's ignorance will take away half the strength of his attack.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid becoming involved in irritating situations is to invoke peace. For the spiritual person, for the sincere seeker it is always advisable to bring down peace from above. While invoking peace you will feel enormous strength inside you and around you. The power of inner peace is infinitely greater, more solid and concrete than any outer situation created by anybody on earth. Your inner peace can easily devour the irritation caused by somebody else. If you are in the office, it is difficult to invoke peace. If you pray before others, they will mock at you. They will misunderstand you. But if there is a quiet corner where you can meditate undisturbed by others and bring down peace, then you can do it even in your office. Otherwise, the best thing to do is to invoke peace during your morning and evening meditations, and keep that peace locked inside your heart to be used during the day whenever you need it most.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to get the fruits of your meditation is to feel that the result, the fruit itself, is a fulfilling experience. This fulfilling experience, in the outer terms, may come in the form of failure or in the form of success. But you will see that it will help you whichever form it takes. It will create one more rung in the ladder, and help you climb to the Highest.</p>
<p>You do something and you get the fruit, either bitter or sweet. Now even when you get a bitter fruit, you have to feet that this bitter fruit will give you an experience necessary for your perfection And if you get a sweet fruit, a delicious fruit, then you can feel that it is also leading you toward your perfection. This is the best way to receive and achieve the fruits of your meditation.</p>
