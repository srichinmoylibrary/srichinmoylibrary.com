<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to become one with soulful music is to have the firm inner conviction that while you are breathing in, the breath is immediately entering directly into your soul. And with the breath, you have to feel that the Universal Consciousness, divine Reality, divine Truth is also entering. Then, when you breathe out, try to feel that you are breathing out the ignorance that is covering your soul. Feel that the veils of ignorance are being lifted and discarded. If you can consciously imagine and feel this, it is the best way to become one with soulful music.</p>
<p>What do we mean by soulful music? If you say it is the music that embodies the soul, then I wish to say that you are mistaken. You have to feel that soulful music is the Light that wants to express itself in a divine way. Even as darkness wants to manifest its authority on earth, Light also wants to manifest its Reality and Divinity in a specific way. Light is the soul of everything. Light is the soul of music, Light is the soul of love, and Light is the soul of all art. When Light divinely manifests itself in the form of music, it is the music of the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can we do to sing most soulfully?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can we do to sing most soulfully?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to think of both the body of the song and the soul of the song. The body of the song is each word. You have to know the meaning of the song well. You may not know the meaning in the same way that I know it, but the actual meaning, the literal meaning, you know well. Suppose you are singing <em>Ore Mor Kheya</em>. You come to know the meaning: <em>Ore</em> is O; <em>Mor</em> is my; <em>Kheya</em> is boat. So when you sing, immediately you come to think of a boat in front of you, a tiny boat. Then the next word is <em>neye;</em> it means boatman. A boat has to have a boatman. So first you envision the boat and then the boatman; you bring the image right in front of your mind. This is the body aspect of the song.</p>
<p>But if you can meditate for five minutes or ten minutes before you sing, then you will get the soul aspect of the song from your meditation. Even if you have not meditated, sometimes it is possible, while bringing the image of each word to your mind, to also get the soul aspect. But you have to be a great seeker.</p>
<p>If you bring the soul aspect forward and also symbolically bring the body aspect forward, the song becomes really soulful. At that time, those who are listening are bound to feel the soul inside the music. They may not even hear your words, your language; they will only see the soul inside. They will see in your face the divine reality. Sometimes your soul has permeated your outer face, and your face is shining. At that time, they don't see anything but the soul.</p>
<p>One time when I was in India, four or five elderly men and women came to listen to my songs. They were all close to the family. I sang <em>Ore Mor Kheya</em> and the man fell asleep immediately. Two of the ladies were really moved to tears. The other two ladies didn't hear anything at all; they didn't hear any words. They were just looking at my face, appreciating my expression. My face at that time became my soul. They didn't even know what I sang; only they became one with the soul which was shining in my face. The first two knew the meaning of <em>Ore Mor Kheya</em> and all that. They identified with the body aspect and they got the meaning. But the other two did not identify with the physical, but with my aspiration aspect. That is why they said they did not hear anything. These are not cock and bull stories; they are authentic.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do our souls sing when we sing most soulfully?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do our souls sing when we sing most soulfully?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, it is either a portion of the soul or the soul proper that sings when we sing most soulfully. One may think it is the voice of the soul, but it is not. The music of the soul is different from the voice of the soul, the language of the soul. The soul can adopt any voice it wants to. The voice of the soul, the language of the soul is light — not electric light, but the light that constantly illumines our inner and outer being.</p>
<p>We can hear singing that comes directly from the soul or from a portion of the soul, even though no voice is being used. The soul can sing directly without any voice.</p>
<p>Very often when we sing most soulfully, even after the song is over we will hear a voice within ourselves as if somebody else were singing the same song. We may be talking to our friends or looking around, but we will be aware that somebody is singing, and that somebody is our soul. How can we be aware of the fact that the song is coming directly from the soul? We can know if it is coming from the soul just by observing our own consciousness. Sometimes we may catch a haunting tune, a very delicate, subtle tune, but it is immediately followed by earthly, undivine thoughts, as if it were being chased by a dog. If undivine thoughts, lower vital thoughts, immediately enter, then the song is not coming directly from the soul. If it is coming directly from the soul, then not an iota of undivine thought can enter during the whole song. We will have our highest and deepest consciousness right from the beginning to the end of the song.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, the music itself has to be soulful. Then only can we offer it. When we hear divine, soulful music, we immediately feel that it is a beautiful flower fresh from our heart garden, ready to be offered at the Feet of God. If we have the feeling that a piece of music is a real flower, a fresh flower, a fragrant flower, we can immediately offer it at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Singing is a form of meditation, I tell you. If you cannot carry a tune, no harm. Then you will not sing in public. But certainly you can sing when you are alone. Once a day you should sing the Invocation. If you don't sing the Invocation once a day, please feel that something is missing in your life. For that day you are not feeding the Supreme; and if you don't feed the Supreme every day, it is an unpardonable crime. The Supreme is not going to give you a mark if you cannot carry a tune. As long as you sing soulfully, the Supreme will be extremely pleased. Tagore once wrote in a poem, "You gave the bird a voice, musical talent. To me you have not given a voice, but still I am singing." When you don't have something, and still you are offering it to God, God is very pleased with you. So try to sing in your own way. Even if the tune is wrong, if you sing soulfully, it is a real form of meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. But when you sing outwardly, it convinces the outer mind. If you sing outwardly, you feel that there is a witness. If you don't complete the song, you will be embarrassed. But if you sing in silence, then in the middle of a line you may stop and nobody will criticise you. But when you do it outwardly, at that time you will be exposed. At that time, you feel that the ear is the witness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The word 'creation' is a complicated term, and 'appreciation' is also a complicated thing. But creation and appreciation can be made very simple. Creation, when it is oneness with God's Will, need not be on the physical plane or the vital plane or the mental plane. It can be on God's own plane, through oneness with God. Suppose somebody has composed a beautiful piece of music. If you can identify yourself with the inner cry of the music, then you become a co-sharer, a co-creator. I always tell my disciples to identify themselves with my songs, with my music, with my poetry. If they can do that, they have every right to feel that they have also composed these songs, that they also have written these poems, that they also have created these paintings. It is one hundred percent true. On the physical plane, I used paper and pen, but that is immaterial. On the inner plane, the real creation is oneness. When an individual realises God, he does not create anything; only he becomes one with God's operation. In the inner world, he and God are not different beings; they are one, like a tiny drop and the vast ocean. When the tiny drop has totally identified itself with the ocean, then it has every right to call itself the ocean. In the same way, sometimes your soul responds to my music. The soul thrills to the music; it just melts and becomes one.</p>
<p>So you don't have to carry a tune properly. If you can identify yourself with the music, at that time you become the source, the composer. Also, when you listen to spiritual music and identify yourself with the singers, if the music is being sung very soulfully, I wish to say that this is nothing short of your own prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a lack of oneness between an individual's own mind and heart. Just as human beings are jealous of one another, so also the mind becomes jealous of the heart, or the vital becomes jealous of the heart. A most beautiful song has come from the heart and not from the mind or vital, so the mind and the vital throw cold water on it. Those other members revolt. Sometimes composers create something so beautiful; it has directly come from the aspiring heart. But the mind and the vital do not identify themselves with the aspiring heart. When the heart is singing, the mind shows a kind of jealous face, a sulking face. Then, he who composed the song does not get utmost joy from his own creation.</p>
<p>Your soul is one with the divine Musician. Your soul knows how to sing, but your outer life does not know how to sing. Your voice is not trained. Sometimes your soul does not cry for musical capacity, but your mind, body, vital and heart-your earthly existence-want it. So your soul at that time surrenders, because it is a harmless desire. Your soul does not want to manifest itself through music, but when your soul sees that it is spiritual music that you want to play, then it has no objection. If the seeker wants to add something to his inner life, his spiritual life, at that time the soul does not have any objection.</p>
<p>Spiritual Masters have the capacity, if they want to, to make somebody a singer or a musician overnight. If I see that you have a tremendous inner cry to learn songs or the guitar, and if your soul really cares for it, then I can give you the capacity on the physical plane. Some of the disciples were not poets at all; far from it. Even their forefathers didn't write poetry. But they have written most beautiful poems. I never tell them that I was the one who made them into poets. Yet how many souls have come to me for help after struggling for hours to write one line properly! So, if the soul wants it, the capacity will definitely be granted.</p>
<p>But if you can identify yourself with other musician-disciples, if you can claim their music as your own, there is nothing wrong with that. The other individual may say, "I did it; you didn't do it." But when there is inner oneness, you have every right to claim it. If you want to identify with the creation of others, which is your own expanded reality, then you can do that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the relationship between music and meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the relationship between music and meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music is the inner or universal language of God. I do not know French or German or Italian, but if music is played, immediately the heart of the music enters into my heart, or my heart enters into the music. At that time, we don't need outer communication; the inner communion of the heart is enough. My heart is communing with the heart of the music and in our communion we become inseparably one.</p>
<p>Meditation and music cannot be separated. When we cry from the inmost recesses of our heart for Peace, Light and Bliss, that is the best type of meditation. We cannot meditate twenty-four hours a day, but we can meditate, say, for two hours a day. Then we can play music or we can listen to music for a couple of hours a day. Next to meditation is music. But it has to be soulful music, the music that stirs and elevates our aspiring consciousness. When we play soulful music, psychic music, then immediately we are transported to the highest realm of consciousness. When we play music soulfully, we go high, higher, highest.</p>
<p>Each time soulful music is played, we get inspiration and delight. In the twinkling of an eye, music can elevate our consciousness. But if we also pray and meditate, then we are undoubtedly more illumined and fulfilled than a music lover who is not consciously following a spiritual life. Each spiritual musician is consciously spreading God's Light on earth. God is the cosmic Player, the eternal Player, and we are His instruments. But there comes a time in the process of our evolution when we feel that we have become totally one with Him. At that time, we are no longer instruments; we ourselves are musicians, divine musicians. It is the Supreme who makes the proper instrument. Then, it is He who makes the player play properly, and it is He who makes the musician.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can spiritual music be played during meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can spiritual music be played during meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, although it depends on the one who meditates. There are many seekers on earth who meditate extremely well, but who have not developed their musical sense. Their ears have not been trained, so we cannot expect them to change their nature overnight. They either lack the capacity of appreciation or they have some austere feeling about music. There are many seekers who have the silly notion that all music comes from the lower vital. They don't encourage their children to learn music because they feel that as soon as they enter into the music world, they will fall. There is some truth to this because we all know that vital music is most appreciated all over the world. Psychic music is not very widely appreciated, and very few people appreciate the soul's music. They feel it is like a stranger, that is entering into their consciousness. But it is actually their eternal tenant, their soul, that is deep within them waiting to come to the fore.</p>
<p>Naturally, undivine music will immediately lower the consciousness. But if divine music is played during deep meditation, it enhances the meditation. Soulful music will immediately help in elevating the consciousness. This is why we play music from time to time in our Centre. We do not encourage music all the time because there are many people who do not appreciate or admire music. We don't want to create problems for them, since it is a group meditation.</p>
<p>So, if you are fond of music, then please play soulful songs or chants during your meditations at home. Soft, soulful music will definitely help you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. There is some music that is really destructive to our inner being. This music comes from the gross physical or the lower vital. Undivine music tries to awaken our lower vital consciousness and throw us into a world of excitement. The spiritual person will immediately be affected by this music. But soulful and spiritual music really helps us; it feeds our inner life. Music has tremendous power. With fire we can burn ourselves, or we can cook and do many other good things. It is the same with music. Divine music immediately elevates our consciousness, whereas undivine music immediately lowers our consciousness, and it tries to destroy our sincere inner cry for a better spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible to be both a musician and a Yogi?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible to be both a musician and a Yogi?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, it is quite possible to be both a musician and a Yogi. In Mother India there have been many saints, sages and spiritual Masters who were blessed with divine music. Their musical talent did not interfere with their God-realisation, and even after achieving God-realisation, their musical talents did not leave them. A Yogi's qualities and a musician's qualities can go side by side, provided the Yogi has the capacity and inherent talent for music. Even if the Yogi spends a very short time in the musical world, he can be a very good musician, but it will take infinitely more time for a musician to become a Yogi.</p>
<p>Yoga means union, inseparable oneness with God. A Yogi is one who has established conscious union with God. He can easily become a musician because in his inseparable oneness with God, he can do anything he wants. But a Yogi has to wait for God's Will. If it is God's Will, he will become a musician; or if it is God's Will, he will become something else. Otherwise, he will just remain with his own lofty realisation and oneness; he will reveal and manifest the highest Peace, Light and Truth the way the Supreme wants him to.</p>
<p>A musician eventually has to become a Yogi, because no musician, no matter what he is playing right now, will remain unrealised. God will not allow any person on earth to remain unrealised forever. If a musician is not a seeker, he has to become a seeker. Then naturally, in the course of time, he will become a Yogi.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can play spiritual music, soulful music, then you will have no problem. But if you play vital music — jazz and rock and roll and all that — then you will not be satisfied. You are pleasing the outer world but you are not pleasing your Inner Pilot in His own way. If you are not an aspiring seeker, that is fine. But if you are a sincere seeker, which you are, then you will feel miserable.</p>
<p>You may say that it is necessary to evolve slowly, that you cannot change your music overnight. Then I will say, "All right, but also try to bring forward the other life." Each time you make a successful attempt, feel, "Oh, my days are numbered. My old life is coming to an end." Feel that you have got enough money, fame and so on.</p>
<p>Even if you have not got enough, just try to convince your mind. In this way your soul will come forward. If you can make yourself feel that the whole world appreciates and admires you, that the whole world has given you what you want, but still you are not satisfied, then you will ask yourself what you still have to do in your life. What you have to do is to please your Inner Pilot in His own way.</p>
<p>Right now you may think that the world will not appreciate your spiritual music. It may take time, but today or tomorrow you will create another world of music. If you go on creating, one day people will appreciate your creation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I bring spirituality into my music?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I bring spirituality into my music?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a sincere seeker you must know that your music has to please the Supreme, who is our eternal Guru. You are quite young. You have to play music that brings inspiration to the heart and not excitement to the vital. You must not play music that will only arouse excitement in the vital. When you play any particular piece, you have to feel whether it is the right music for your own spiritual progress and inner growth. Play only music that inspires you, that comes from the very depth of your heart and illumines your consciousness.</p>
<p>You have to know that each seeker-musician has a golden opportunity to please the Supreme with his music. Whenever you play any music, you have to know whether or not that music is going to please the Supreme. If it pleases you and you feel it will please Him, then play it. If you feel it does not please Him, then never play it. Playing lower vital music to get appreciation from the public can never please the Supreme. If an ordinary person who has not launched into the spiritual path plays that kind of music, he is doing the right thing according to his own standard. But if a seeker plays that kind of music, he cannot make any progress.</p>
<p>A sincere seeker who has already accepted a path of his own should play only spiritual music, psychic music, music that elevates his consciousness and the consciousness of others. When you play this kind of music, you will see that in each note God Himself is blossoming like a lotus, petal by petal. When you play divine music, please feel that God is unveiling His own inner music and fulfilling Himself in and through you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To the musician, sound is his own child. It is like a flower to the garden; a garden without a flower is useless. Similarly, the musician is useless without his beautiful inner child. The musician and sound are like the Creator and the creation. They are inseparable and indispensable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you are all interested in the spontaneous fountain of the heart. If you can play the music by heart, you can give life to it; you can add real life to it. But when you read the music, the eyes are seeing the paper and the mind is operating very nicely. At that time, the mental consciousness enters into the picture; the paper consciousness enters into the mind, and the spontaneous, soulful qualities are all gone. So let the fountain flow only from the heart. If you have another small fountain in the mind, in spite of having a big fountain in the heart, you are going to create a problem. Again, if you know all the notes but just play mechanically, that also is not good. You shall learn by heart, but you shall also give life to the music while playing. You are representing spirituality. Reading the music will take away from the spiritual quality, even though it is the usual method. I am trying to bring out spiritual music from all my children.</p>
