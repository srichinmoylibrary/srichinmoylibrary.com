<p>She was an elderly lady and she thought that the Master cared only for the young generation. He has no concern for the old generation, she thought. The Master encouraged her individually and there came a time when the Master paid extra attention to her. Alas, this extra attention caused tremendous fear in her romantic, vital life. Therefore, she left.</p>

<p>She was an elderly woman, extremely devoted to the Master. One day she came to the Master crying and weeping. Her son-in-law, a policeman, had been severely wounded by a bullet and was in the hospital. She came to the Master to ask whether her son-in-law would survive. The Master said, “I do not know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know? Then why do you claim yourself to be a God-realised soul?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “A God-realised soul does not have to know everything, and sometimes he prays to God to give him the capacity to unlearn most of the things that he has learned.”</p>
<p>This dry philosophy of the Master did not satisfy the old lady. She said, “Since you cannot read the future, how am I going to place my future at your feet?”</p>
<p>She left.</p>

<p>He felt that he had come to be greater than his Master, more spiritual than his Master, more famous than his Master. He thought that he would show that he knew better than father, mother, sister, friends, but fate did not work in that way. His self-styled superior knowledge was not accepted. Therefore, he left the path.</p>

<p>Although he brought disciples to his Master, in secret he was always cherishing the desire that he would remain the messenger, the bridge, between the Master and the seekers he brought to the Master’s path. He felt he would always remain their leader. Through him they would have to approach the Master — especially the women disciples. “They touch the Master’s feet, but they should touch my feet because it is I who have brought them to the Master,” he thought.</p>
<p>When he saw the women disciples become friendly with other members of the group, his pride was hurt. Jealousy-snake put an end to his spiritual life on this particular path.</p>

<p>“I have stayed with him for seven long years. He says that he is all compassion for me, no matter what kind of life I lead. He told us that his compassion is the strongest power. So how is it that the strongest power cannot save me from my indulgent life? If he really had compassion, he would have cured me totally, for he knows how I suffer. His compassion has no power. If it had power, I would not keep going back again and again to the lower life of sense-gratification. If he does not have power, what good is it to keep him as my Master? And if he has power but does not use it to transform my nature, what is the use of having him?</p>
<p>“He told me, ‘Do anything you like, but stay.’ But if he really has compassion, why do I do this kind of thing? To realise God I came here. Why am I not realising God? If he had really realised God, he would have given me realisation. The best thing is to have realisation in my own way and not the Master’s way.”</p>
<p>So this disciple left the path.</p>

<p>The husband and wife were blessed with a daughter. The husband told their Master that he had had a dream. In the dream he saw that it was Sri Ramakrishna himself who had come into their family. The Master said, “It is impossible; Sri Ramakrishna has not come. A great soul like Sri Ramakrishna has not come into your family. Just yesterday, in the soul’s world, I had a talk with Ramakrishna about something.” But the husband’s dream was so vivid that he felt either the Master was telling a lie or the Master did not want to give him or his family proper credit for the kind of soul that had come into their family. So both of them left.</p>

<p>He had a vision. According to him it was the highest vision that a human being can have. He was all excited. But the Master told him that that kind of vision is not of a high order, although it is encouraging and inspiring. The Master encouraged him to meditate more soulfully and devotedly and assured him that he would grant him a higher vision. But the disciple did not believe in the Master’s statement or assurance. He was positive that his vision was genuine and, at the same time, of a very high order, the highest order. Therefore, he left.</p>

But the man’s English friends and his so-called well-wishers told him that the American girls are no good, that they live all the time in the emotional, vital world. So he was frightened and he left the Centre.</p>
