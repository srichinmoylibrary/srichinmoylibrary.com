  <h2 id="page-title">Hinduism: Its spiritual significance</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Hinduism: Its spiritual significance" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The ideal of Hinduism is to see all in the Self and the Self in all. A Hindu believes that each individual is a conscious manifestation of God. The spirit of selfless service is his supreme secret. A Hindu unmistakably feels that God is manifesting and perfecting Himself through each human being. Each individual soul represents a type of divinity projected by the Supreme. Each human being has a mission to fulfil on earth, and he does it at God's choice hour.</p>
<p>The breath of Hinduism is spirituality. Whatever a Hindu does, he does as a means to this end. It is true, as with any other individual, that he wants to accomplish all that he can here on earth. But the important thing is that he does not and cannot do anything at the expense of his spiritual life. To him, the spiritual life is the only life that can eventually garland him with the victory of perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, people very often use the word "sin." Here I must say that a Hindu has nothing to do with sin. He takes into consideration only two things: Ignorance and Light. With his soul's light, he wants to swim across the sea of ignorance and transform his lower self into his higher Self.</p>
<p><em>Tena tyaktena bhunjita.</em> "Enjoy through renunciation." This is the life-giving message of the Hindu seers. What is to be renounced is the train of our desires, nothing more and nothing less. In renouncing all our earth-bound desires, we can have the taste of true divine fulfilment.</p>
<p>I have already told you that the breath of Hinduism is spirituality. In the spiritual life, the control of the senses plays a great part. Since such is the case, let us try to clearly understand the function of the senses. A devout Hindu feels that his senses are not meant for mortification. The senses are his instruments. Their assistance is indispensable. The senses should and must function in full vigour, for the divine purpose of an all-fulfilling, integral wholeness. Then alone can true divinity dawn in human life. Self-indulgence ends in utter frustration. Poor mankind! It is so lavish in using and exhausting the pleasures of the body. Certainly man is not so lavish in his life with anything else as he is with his self-indulgence. Alas, to his utter surprise, before he exhausts the pleasures of the body, his very life exhausts itself into futile nothingness. It is high time for the brute in man to give place to the divine in him. Brutality does not conquer. It kills.</p>
<p>Spirituality is the all-embracing love. This love conquers man and makes him conscious of his true, inner divinity, so that he can fulfil himself and become a perfect channel for God's manifestation. This love, or this bond of love, man can create within himself in order to bind or unite himself with other individuals, other nationals, other internationals. This is what a devout Hindu feels.</p>
<p>No movement, no progress. Movement needs guidance. Guidance is knowledge. But man has to know that mental knowledge can only help him to a certain extent. With its help, he can go nowhere near the Goal. It is the knowledge of the soul that grants man his God-realisation.</p>
<p>Robert Browning said:</p>

<p>So free we seem,<br /> So fettered fast we are.</p>

<p>Man is bound to the finite, but he cannot be bound by the finite. Man has surrendered himself to time and space. But neither time nor space has compelled him to surrender. Man tries to possess the beauty of the finite. He thinks that if he can bind himself to the finite, he will be able to possess its beauty. Alas, instead of possessing, he has been possessed. Time and space have lured him. He thought he would be able to possess them with his surrender. They gladly accepted his surrender. But he has been possessed by them mercilessly. Possession is not oneness; conquest is not unity.</p>
<p>The vision of Hinduism is unity in diversity. First, Hinduism lovingly embraces all alien elements; second, it tries to assimilate them; third, it tries to expand itself as a whole, with a view to serving humanity and nature. Indeed, this is the sign of its life's meaningful, dynamic aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Hinduism: The journey of India&#039;s soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Hinduism: The journey of India&#039;s soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Hinduism is an inner experience; it is the experience of the soul. Hinduism is not a religion. It is the name of a culture: a self-disciplined, spiritual culture. The word "religion", in fact, is not to be found in the dictionary of a Hindu. His dictionary houses the word <em>dharma. Dharma</em>, no doubt, includes religion, but its long arms stretch far beyond the usual conception of religion. <em>Dharma</em> means the inner code of life, the deeper significance of human existence. <em>Dharma</em> is a Sanskrit word which derives from the root <em>dhri</em>, to hold. What holds man is his inner law. This inner law is a divine, all-fulfilling experience that frees man from the fetters of ignorance even while he is in the physical world.</p>
<p>Religion, on the other hand, is derived from the Latin verb <em>ligare</em>, to bind. The ancient Romans saw religion as a force which binds and controls man. But the ancient Indian seers felt that religion, nay, <em>dharma</em>, must release man from that which binds him, that is, his own ignorance. Man's awakened consciousness must do away with ignorance, or to be precise, must transform ignorance into the knowledge of Truth.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dharma</em> is the Indian conception in which rights and duties lose the artificial antagonism created by a view of the world which makes selfishness the root of action, and regain their deep and eternal unity. <em>Dharma</em> is the basis of democracy which Asia must recognise, for in this lies the distinction between the soul of Asia and the soul of Europe. Through <em>Dharma</em> the Asiatic evolution fulfils itself; this is her secret.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In days of yore, Hinduism was known as the <em>Arya Dharma</em>. Strangely enough, even now people are not quite sure from which part of the globe the Aryans entered India. Some, indeed, are of the opinion that the Aryans did not come from outside at all. Swami Vivekananda heads the list of these firm believers.</p>
<p>The origin of the word "Hindu" is very strange. It is closely associated with the river <em>Sindhu</em>, the present Indus. But the ancient Iranians, who desired to call the Aryans by name of the river on which they lived, pronounced it "Hindu." The Aryans seemed to like the name and we, who are their descendants, are enamoured and proud of the name "Hindu."</p>
<p>Hinduism or the Hindu <em>Dharma</em> is found on the spiritual teachings of the Hindu seers. The Hindu <em>shastras</em>, or scriptures which govern Hindu life and conduct, are illumined and surcharged with the light and power of the hallowed teachings of these ancient seers.</p>
<p>Many are the Hindu <em>shastras</em>. Each has made a singular, powerful contribution to the whole. The oldest and foremost of all these are the <em>Vedas</em>. They are considered the oldest written scriptures to have appeared since the dawn of civilisation. The other scriptures have the <em>Vedas</em> as their only fount. The <em>Vedas</em> have another name, <em>Shruti</em>, that which is heard. They are so called because they are based on direct revelation. The authority of the <em>Vedas</em> rests on direct, inner spiritual experience that stems from divine Reality. A Hindu feels in the inmost recesses of his heart that to doubt the inner experiences of the Vedic seers is to doubt the very existence of Truth. <em>Vid</em>, to know, is the Sanskrit root of the word <em>Veda. Veda</em> actually means the Knowledge of God. As God is infinite, even so is His Knowledge. We observe in the <em>Vedas</em>, with surprise and delight, that the Truth discoveries are infinitely more important than the Truth discoverers. Unfortunately, the order of the present day is the reverse. The <em>Vedas</em> are four in number: <em>Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda</em> and <em>Atharva Veda</em>. Each of the <em>Vedas</em> consists of two sections: <em>Samhita</em> and <em>Brahmana. Samhita</em> contains the hymns or <em>mantras</em>, while <em>Brahmana</em> expounds their significance and appropriate application.</p>
<p>All the other Hindu <em>shastras</em>, other than the <em>Vedas</em> proper, are known as <em>Smritis. Smriti</em> literally means anything that is remembered. The <em>Smritis</em> cherish their great indebtedness to the <em>Vedas</em>. They are proud of the fact that they own their authority to the <em>Vedas</em> and to the <em>Vedas</em> alone. They have traditionally exercised great authority in laying down social and domestic laws, plying their boat between the shores of <em>Vidhi</em>, injunctions, and <em>Nishedha</em>, prohibitions in Hindu society.</p>
<p>Now let us focus our attention on the <em>Upanishads. Upa</em> means near, <em>ni</em> means down, <em>shad</em> means sit. <em>Upanishad</em> refers to pupils sitting at the feet of their teacher, learning their spiritual lessons. The <em>Upanishads</em> are the philosophic and reasoned parts of the <em>Vedas</em>. They are also called <em>Vedanta</em>, end of the <em>Vedas</em>. There are two reasons for this. One is that they actually appear towards the end of the <em>Vedas</em>; the other is that they contain the spiritual essence of the <em>Vedas</em>, which is all Light and Delight. The actual number of the <em>Upanishads</em> still remains unknown. One hundred and eight have been faithfully preserved. Of these the most significant are <em>Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundakya, Aitareya, Chhandogya, Brihadaranyaka</em> and <em>Svetasvatara</em>.</p>
<p>God-realisation abides in meditation, never in books. This is the supreme secret of the <em>Upanishads</em>. The sages and the seers in the <em>Upanishads</em> asked their pupils to meditate, only to meditate. They did not even advise their students to depend on the <em>Vedas</em> as an aid to realising God. "Meditate, the Brahman is yours! Meditate! Immortality is yours!" At the beginning of the journey of the human soul, the Upanishadic seers cried out, <em>Uttisthata jagrata ...</em> "Arise, awake, stop not until the Goal is reached." At the journey's end, the same seers cried out once again, <em>Tat twam asi</em>, "That Thou art."</p>
<p>Now let us come to the <em>Sad-Darshana</em>, the Six Systems of Indian philosophy. These are the various schools of thought later introduced by some of the Hindu sages. The sage <em>Jaimini's</em> system is called <em>Purva Mimansa</em>; others are Vyasa's <em>Uttar Mimansa</em> or <em>Vedanta</em>, Kapila's <em>Sankhya</em>, Patanjali's <em>Yoga</em>, Gotama's <em>Nyaya</em> and Kanada's <em>Vaisheshika</em>. If one studies the <em>Nyaya</em> first, then it becomes easier to fathom the other systems of thought.</p>
<p>All of the Six Systems were written in <em>sutras</em> or aphorisms. The sages did this because they wanted not to expound the philosophy, but to express in the briefest possible sentences their soul-stirring revelations and to have these engraved on the memory of the aspirant. Through the passage of time, the aphorisms have been significantly adorned and armoured with countless notes and commentaries.</p>
<p>It is high time for us to invite Professor Max Muller to join us in today's momentous journey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty that nature can bestow — in some parts a very paradise on earth — I should point to India.... If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life and has found solutions to some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant — I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thought of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw the corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life — again I should point to India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To walk along the royal path of the Six Systems of Philosophy is difficult. That path is for the learned and the select few. The common run needs an easier path. It is here that the <em>Puranas</em> come into the picture. The <em>Puranas</em> teach us the Hindu religion with inspiring and thought-provoking stories, anecdotes and parables. The <em>Puranas</em> present Hinduism in an easy, interesting, charming and convincing manner. The major difference between the <em>Vedas</em> and the <em>Puranas</em> is that the Vedic gods represent the cosmic attributes of the One, while the Puranic gods represent His human attributes.</p>
<p>Now the Bhagavad Gita or the Song Celestial demands our immediate attention. It is the scripture par excellence. The <em>Gita</em> is the life-breath of Hinduism. The <em>Gita</em> not only tells us to realise God, but it also tells us how. The <em>Gita</em> introduces three principal paths towards God-realisation: <em>Karma Yoga</em>, the path of action; <em>Jnana Yoga</em>, the path of knowledge; and <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>, the path of devotion. Emotional devotion and philosophical detachment not only can but must run abreast to fulfil the Divine here on earth. This sublime teaching of the <em>Gita</em> knows no equal. Without hesitation, a devout Hindu can say that the <em>Gita</em> has been the solace of his whole life and will be the solace of his death.</p>
<p>Certain people are heartily sick of our rituals and rites. To them, these are nothing but cheap, confused and showy affairs. But the critics will have no choice but to revise their opinions when they come to know why we perform rituals. Needless to say, we want spirituality to govern our lives, both inner and outer. Without purity of the mind, there can be no true spirituality. And for those who want purity, the performance of rituals is often an invaluable necessity. We know that when the mind is pure, illumination dawns. The subtle truths that lie beyond the range of our senses enter into our consciousness directly through the pure mind. Participation in rituals greatly aids this process. Granted, rituals are externals. But we have to know that it is the externals that bring home the truth to individuals. Rituals eventually touch the very core of our consciousness. Rituals permeate every aspect of Hindu life.</p>
<p>Rites, too, have been in vogue since the days of the <em>Atharva Veda</em>. Rites, if performed with an inner urge and an aspiring heart, can help us considerably to conquer the hostile forces, avert untold misfortunes and fulfil life in its divine plenitude. Indeed, this is the divine attitude. The fear of a spiritual fall threatens us only when we use the rites, or rather the magic or lesser rites, to gain selfish and undivine ends.</p>
<p>A word about images and symbols. We do not worship images and symbols. We worship the spirit behind them. This spirit is God. It is so easy to feel the presence of God in and through a concrete form. Through the form, one has to go to the Formless; through the finite, to the Infinite.</p>
<p>We worship nature. Others smile at our folly. We laugh at their ignorance. Why do we worship nature? Because we have discovered the truth. We have discovered the truth that God manifests Himself not only through nature but also <em>as</em> nature. "A thing of beauty is a joy forever", said Keats. Beauty is soul. Soul is all joy. A Hindu seeker cannot separate the aspiration of nature from the beauty and joy of the soul. Nature's aspiration and the soul's delight together create an all-loving, all-embracing and all-fulfilling perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>"Look at the zenith of Hindu folly"! the critics say. "For of all things in God's creation, a Hindu has to worship animals, trees, even snakes and stones." Alas, when will these men of so-called wisdom come to learn that we do not worship the stones as stones, the snakes as snakes, the trees as trees and the animals as animals. What we do is very simple, direct and spontaneous. We worship the Supreme in all these; nothing more and nothing less. With this attitude a Hindu desires to worship each and every object of the world, from the largest to the tiniest.</p>
<p>Let us speak of the caste system, which has been an object of ceaseless criticism. What is caste? In the deepest sense of the term, caste is unity in variety. No variety, no sign of life. Variety is essential to the cosmic evolution. All individuals cannot have the same kind of development: physical, vital, mental or spiritual. Neither is such similarity imperative. The thing of paramount importance is that each individual be given infinite opportunity and freedom to develop along his own line of growth.</p>
<p>In this lofty ideal, there is only one idea: to serve and be served. Each individual has his rightful place in this ideal. The caste system is to be regarded like the functioning of one's own limbs. My feet are in no way inferior to my head; one complements the other. <em>Brahmin</em> (priest, teacher and law-maker), <em>Kshatriya</em> (king and warrior), <em>Vaishya</em> (merchant, trader and agriculturist) and <em>Shudra</em> (labourer, servant and dedicated hand) are all united by their mutual service. Caste is not a division. It embodies the secret of proper understanding. And it is in proper understanding that we fulfil ourselves fully. A Hindu feels this sober truth.</p>
<p>True Hinduism abjures all that divides and separates. It dreams of the Supreme Truth in absolute freedom, perfect justice in all-embracing love and the highest individual liberation in unconditional service to humanity.</p>
<p>Hinduism gives due importance to all the spiritual figures of the world. It recognises a great harmony in their teachings. Down through the ages, the firmament of India has sent forth the message of Peace, Love and Truth. It has fostered and encouraged the synthesis of all world religions. Further, Hinduism has always affirmed that the highest end of life is not to remain in any particular religion, but to outgrow religion and realise and live in Eternal Truth.</p>
<p>Hinduism is the embodiment of certain lofty, infallible ideals. These ideals within us live and grow, grow and live. Because of this fact, Hinduism is still a living force. It lives to lead. It leads to live.</p>
<p>To know Hinduism is to discover India. To discover India is to feel the Breath of the soul. To feel the Breath of the soul is to become one with God.</p>

<p>What is India's inner message to the world at large? Spirituality. What is spirituality? It is the natural way of truth that successfully communes with the Beyond here on earth.</p>
<p>What is India's absolutely distinctive possession? Her soul. She lives in the soul, she lives from the soul and she lives for the soul.</p>
<p>Where can the world find the real nature of India? In the ever-wakeful domain of the Spirit.</p>
<p>What has made the history of India unique? A most surprising and unusual continuity in the line of her spiritual seekers and Masters.</p>
<p>What does Indian spirituality teach? It teaches the world to conquer the evil of the lower nature and to go beyond the good of the higher nature.</p>
<p>What is Mother India's desire? It is to transcend the human way once and for all, through radical self-transmutation, and to enter into the ever-dynamic way of God.</p>
<p>Religion, however mighty it may be, is not and cannot be the message of India. Her message is Self-realisation.</p>
<p>The perfect truth of India's religion lies in its outer and inner realisation of the One that is, of the One that is in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>O world, as you march on towards the deepest recesses of your heart, to your amazement, you will find Mother India to be anything but God-fearing. What then is she? She is God-loving: the God-loving soul in God's all-dreaming and all-manifesting Truth.</p>
<p>The soul of India feels that to be satisfied with intellectual speculation is to remain satisfied with only half the food that is actually needed for health. It is realisation that gives one a full meal. And if one seeks realisation, meditation and concentration are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Indian philosophy, in its sublimest sense, is nothing short of the practical realisation of the Truth.</p>
<p>There is no more than a hyphen between the Vision of the Vedic seers and the soul of India, and between India's spirituality and the final spiritual liberation of the world.</p>
<p>They say that India long ago lost the Milky Way of greatness. But we know that she has now a colossal hope that the overcast sky will clear at last, revealing again the myriad points of light.</p>
<p>What were the chief causes of India's downfall? She neglected the body-consciousness and eschewed the material life. She narrowed her outlook and sealed herself up in the outworn rituals of the past. She clung to the festering shell of her ancient culture while killing its living, growing spirit. And India's doom was sealed the day she started these practises.</p>
<p>India began to rise the day she turned away from these tendencies and accepted life in all its dynamic aspects.</p>
<p>India will rise fully the day she becomes self-reliant. She knows well that she cannot achieve her goal if she has to depend permanently on alien help. Self-help is the best help. Self-help is God's own help in disguise.</p>
<p>India has within her a voice that is the selfsame, all-fulfilling Voice of God. That Voice she simply must hear and obey.</p>
<p>What is actually meant by the emancipation of the Indian woman? It means that she must no longer be alienated from education. She must have free access to the worldwide knowledge of the present day, in addition to the sacred lore of past centuries. True education helps us to live in the integral perfection which is the very backbone of our existence on earth. The Indian woman must be given a full opportunity to develop and manifest this perfection.</p>
<p>The emancipation of the Indian woman also means that she must not be suppressed and dominated by man. She must be free to be herself, independent in her own right, strong and confident, a true partner and companion of man and not his drudge and serf. She must become again what she was in Vedic India, a respected and equal citizen, a glorious complement to man.</p>
<p>Today's India is poverty-stricken. But tomorrow's India will be prosperous. She will be a mighty wave of hope and faith. Her very thought will be stirred with a new vision. Infinite will be the possibilities on her horizon. He sacrifice will build a more durable foundation for mankind. She will contain within herself nationalism and internationalism, becoming the true symbol of spirituality in action.</p>
<p>India with her spiritual power will wield a tremendous influence on future generations. This is no imagination, but vision in operation.</p>
<p>India and India alone is the nerve centre of the aspiring world.</p>
<p>India's strength is not in her arms, but in her heart. More so, it is in her seer-vision.</p>
<p>India tells the world that the realisation of unity is the only strength which can conquer the world.</p>
<p>India is the seeker of the Absolute. The <em>summum bonum</em> of life is the ideal of God-realisation. In her heart there is a burning love of God; in her mind, the service of unawakened humanity.</p>
<p>Consumed with desires and temptations, Europe rushed towards India to acquire her fabulous wealth. That is true. But it is equally and absolutely true that Europe's soul came to India with a spiritual seeking and an occult urge to discover what India was actually like.</p>
<p>India has three world-conquering weapons: Non-violence, Peace and the Wisdom which tells that she is in All as All is in her.</p>
<p>India's choice is character. But she must feel that she needs personality as well.</p>
<p>Mother India's fear is not of atomic bombs but of her children's self-forgetful amnesia.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, India has perfectly reconciled in herself the two worst antagonists: renunciation and epicurianism.</p>
<p>Perfection was the choice of the Greeks. Proportion was the choice of the Romans. Universality is the choice of the Indians.</p>
<p>India is the voice that never falters. Hers is the truth that cannot be silenced by the threatening darkness of centuries. Hers is the heart that sings perpetually of the unity of mankind.</p>
<p>India is the vault of an ancient eternal wisdom that has a universal appeal. She is also the universal reserve bank of an ever-growing wisdom, and she is destined to be the hub and dynamo of world transformation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">East and West</h2><span property="dc:title" content="East and West" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The East says: "I have seen God's Face. Now I must see His Feet." The West says: "I have seen God's Feet. Now I must see His Face."</p>
<p>The East says: "I have seen God's Transcendence." The West says: "I have seen God's Immanence."</p>
<p>The East considers life to be a continuous growth from matter to spirit. The West considers life to be a continuous growth from the simple material life to a complex and ever-expanding scientific development.</p>
<p>The indifferent East felt that it had nothing to hear from the West. The proud West thought that it had nothing to learn from the East.</p>
<p>According to the East, the West is anything but divine. According to the West, the East is idle.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the East is terribly afraid of a dynamic life. Similarly, the West is terribly afraid of lone self-poise.</p>
<p>The East is perhaps wanting in care, detail and exactitude. But the West is wanting in breadth, vastness and universality. The East is wanting in an earthly, practical intelligence. The West is wanting in the matchless realisation of the Self. The East feels that the mastery of one's own inner movements is the true fulfilment of life. The West feels that the mastery of the world is the true fulfilment of life.</p>
<p>Humility and devotion are the birthright of the East. Honesty and frankness are the birthright of the West. The combination of these four powers should be the ideal of a human being.</p>
<p>The East wanted to conquer the world in the name of liberation. The West wanted to conquer the world in the name of commerce and religion.</p>
<p>The East has control of Spirit. The West has control of Matter. Spirit is creative, conscious existence. What is Matter? It is anything but lifeless mechanical substance. Matter is vibrant energy which deliberately hides within itself life and consciousness.</p>
<p>The individual of the East is content to abide by the maxim, "Let me live unseen and unknown, and unlamented let me die." And, it might be added, "Let it all be done without too much exertion." The individual of the West, on the other hand, seems to desire the full expression of his individuality. He wishes to make for himself a strong and powerful position in his own world.</p>
<p>The East's age-long experience with the spiritual life has taught it an inner poise and equanimity in work. It can stand aside from frustration, excitement, irritation over minor upsets and all that disturbs the inner balance. It can make tranquil readjustments and proceed in the same calm tenor. This the West has yet to learn.</p>
<p>The West's intensive experience with material progress has taught it to be objective in work. It has learned to stand aside from favouritism, nepotism and other personal considerations in carrying out a necessary job. It can do the work for its own sake, quickly and efficiently, and with the best man-power available. This the East has yet to learn.</p>
<p>Indian philosophy is, in its origin, the search for the highest Truth. Only the Reality beyond the senses has been able to quench the inner thirst of the East.</p>
<p>European philosophy is, in its origin, an examination of ideas by the critical intellect. Until now, reason and intellect have been enough to feed the hungry West.</p>
<p>It is now that East and West have come to realise the need of a marriage between Mind and Spirit.</p>
<p>East and West may be taken as the two eyes of the same human body. The other human divisions and distinctions — racial, cultural and linguistic — are destined to disappear from the human consciousness when it is flooded with the supramental Light and Force. This is the inevitable consequence of the Hour of God that is dawning all over the world. Diversities will be there, enriched and enhanced in fullest measure. But these diversities will not be disturbances to the general consciousness. On the contrary, they will be happy and harmonious complements to a unique whole. Humanity will be a true human family in every sense of the term and in a yet unknown sense. The response to the new Light will certainly exceed human expectations.</p>
<p>The awakened consciousness of man is visibly tending towards the Divine. This is a most hopeful streak of light amidst the surrounding obscurities of today. This is a moment, not merely of joining hands, but of joining minds, hearts and souls. Across all physical and mental barriers between East and West, high above national standards, above even individual standards, will fly the supreme banner of Divine Oneness.</p>
