How have you done this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I am praying, I am communing with the Highest Absolute. I speak to Him either like a beggar to an emperor or like a child to his grandfather. I started praying and meditating — you can say unconsciously — at the age of four or five. But since the very beginning of my conscious spiritual journey, I have been praying to the Supreme not only for my own perfection in life but also for a oneness-world founded upon inner peace. At this point in my spiritual journey, all my prayers are for others, for the world, for peace.</p>
<p>Then again, in the highest sense, there is no separation between myself and ‘others’. After I attained my own conscious union with God, I came to realise that there is only one ‘person’, and that is my universal oneness-life. So when I pray, automatically I include in my prayer all human beings on earth. And when I meditate, that too is for the benefit of all the souls in God’s entire Universe. Once you have established your oneness with God’s Will, it is extremely easy to meditate soulfully, powerfully and unconditionally for God’s Will to be executed in and through each human being on earth.</p>

If not, what kind of language should we use?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can say ‘You’ or ‘Thou’ or refer to God by whatever name you feel comfortable with, or in whatever aspect you like. You can offer your prayers to God the Compassionate, God the Almighty, God the Beloved Supreme or any other aspect of God that pleases you.</p>
<p>During prayer and meditation, it is advisable to speak to God in your own mother tongue because the language that you learned right from birth has become inseparably one with your life-breath, which is all simplicity, sincerity, purity and divinity. So it is advisable, especially for seekers, to pray to God in the language they were brought up with.</p>
<p>Most of the time I speak to God in the Chittagong dialect which was spoken in my village, or in pure Bengali. Sometimes I speak English, but English comes last. When I was younger, every day I would recite a prayer from the Upanishads, India’s sacred scriptures, which are in the Sanskrit language. Also, I used to read prayers in French, but I get more joy from Bengali prayers. If I pray to God in the Chittagong dialect, the prayer is more spontaneous.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What techniques do you use in your meditation to achieve inner awareness, an opening up to spiritual strength and the creation of a ‘new consciousness&#039;? What do you do and what method do your disciples follow?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What techniques do you use in your meditation to achieve inner awareness, an opening up to spiritual strength and the creation of a ‘new consciousness&#039;? What do you do and what method do your disciples follow?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What we sleeplessly need in our inner lives is aspiration — the heart’s inner cry. This aspiration we get from deep within, during our prayer and meditation. God is infinite, and there are infinite ways to realise Him. Similarly, there are many ways to meditate, not one single way. Each individual has to discover his own way of meditation for the fastest spiritual growth.</p>
<p>In the case of my students, I advise them to meditate on the heart, and to think of the compassionate and personal aspect of God. What God has and what God is is infinite Compassion — Compassion in His creation and Compassion beyond His creation. So we try to meditate on this aspect of God. It is like father and child. The father may be very great; others may be afraid of him or hold him in awe. But the child is all love for his father, and can run to his father and speak to him at any time. So we try to approach God the compassionate Father with our heart’s love, devotion and surrender. But there are many ways to approach God, and others may prefer to approach God in His impersonal aspect.</p>
<p>I do not give my students any secret mantra or incantation to repeat. I tell them that if they want to repeat a mantra, they should say ‘Supreme’. In general, I advise them to remain calm and quiet and not to allow any thoughts to disturb their minds.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask them to do different things in order to get inspiration. I may tell them to look at a flower and appreciate its beauty and purity, so that they will be reminded of their soul’s inner beauty and purity. Or I may ask them to get inspiration by looking at the flame of a candle, since this outer flame will remind them of their inner flame. I may ask them to imagine a vast expanse of water and try to enter into its vastness during their meditation. I may ask them to imagine a mountain, because this will inspire them to raise their consciousness high, higher, highest.</p>
<p>In my writings I have described many more techniques for meditation. The individual seeker has to choose the way that will help him make the fastest progress. But no matter which technique one uses, aspiration is of paramount importance. If one does not have the heart’s burning inner cry for God, then no technique will work. Again, if one is sincerely crying for God, then any technique will work.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between the meditation of the heart, spiritual concentration and contemplation of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between the meditation of the heart, spiritual concentration and contemplation of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take spirituality as a huge book that deals with a great many subjects. Three of the main subjects are concentration, meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>Concentration is one-pointedness. When the seeker concentrates, he focuses his attention on something tinier than the tiniest, and eventually acquires tremendous will-power.</p>
<p>Meditation is another subject. When the seeker meditates, he meditates on something vaster than the vastest in order to acquire infinite peace, infinite light and infinite bliss.</p>
<p>The third subject is contemplation. In contemplation, the seeker feels that God the Lover and God the Beloved are one. At one moment God plays the role of the Beloved Supreme to bless, illumine, transform and immortalise the seeker. The next moment He plays the role of the divine lover in the seeker to elevate the seeker’s consciousness so that the seeker can realise the ever-transcending peace, light and bliss of God’s own birthless and deathless Vision.</p>

Do you feel suited for today’s world, or do you try to conform to the world while bringing good into it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As the inner life is fruitless and useless without peace, even so the outer life is fruitless and useless without dynamism. According to me, India’s spirituality lies in its inner peace, just as the Western world’s progress lies in its outer dynamism. The dynamism of the West and the inner peace of the East must go together in order to bring about a world of perfect harmony and perfect satisfaction.</p>
<p>I owe my aspiration-heart to India; I owe my dedication-life to America. I feel that the inner life of aspiration and the outer life of dedication are both needed in order to manifest the divine Light of our Heavenly Father here on earth.</p>
<p>I do not follow a prearranged plan. I just obey devotedly, soulfully and unconditionally the express Command of my Lord Beloved Supreme. In the beginning I was absolutely puzzled and confused by the West. But over the years I have been able to accept the Western world, with all its good and bad qualities, as my own.</p>
<p>Now with my aspiration-heart I am praying to God to inundate both the Eastern world and the Western world with His absolute Love, Peace and Delight. And with my dedication-life I am trying to inspire the world to cry for a better, purer and higher life.</p>

Did you choose your life-role? Can we draw a parallel between your life and that of the Biblical prophet Samuel and also with the Little Shepherd of Fatima?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely God needs man. God is both the Creator and the creation. Man is nothing other than God the creation. God needs man to manifest His Light on earth, and man needs God to realise his own highest height. So God the Creator and God the creation undoubtedly need each other.</p>
<p>I did not choose my life-role. My Inner Pilot commanded me to serve those who want and need my inner guidance, and to be their spiritual teacher. There are many God-seekers all over the world who are searching for a spiritual teacher.</p>
<p>I would not compare myself with either the Biblical prophet Samuel or the Little Shepherd of Fatima. I am only a God-lover who is trying to be a soulful and perfect instrument of God’s Will. But I can tell you that God is able to bestow upon others the same great capacities and good qualities that He bestowed upon the prophet Samuel and the Little Shepherd of Fatima. God’s Blessings are infinite, and He has a special Plan to fulfil in and through each individual on earth who is ready and willing to serve Him.</p>
<p>Both Samuel and the Little Shepherd fulfilled God’s Vision most satisfactorily. Each human being in God’s creation should also try to fulfil God in God’s own Way. Indeed, this is precisely what God wants from us — always to please Him in His own Way. Ultimately we will discover that to please God is to fulfil ourselves.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Actually, my elder brother Chitta gave me this name. In India, it is not always the parents who give names to their children. Sometimes other members of the family may give the names. My brother Chitta is quite a bit older than I am. Before I was born, he had a few dreams in which he clearly saw that a spiritual figure would be born into his family, and it was he who chose this name.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was in my highest meditative trance, my highest consciousness, when I saw the King of the Universe and had this most soulful and powerful conversation with Him. I saw Him with my third eye, which is called the vision-eye. This eye exists between the two physical eyebrows and slightly above, but only those who have the intuitive faculty can see it.</p>
<p>It was a subtle inner vision. In that vision He appeared before me in His Transcendental Form. He was all gold — a beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful being — infinitely more beautiful than I can ever describe! In that particular vision I called Him the King of the Universe. But now I usually call Him the Supreme.</p>
<p>Previously I could only see Him with my third eye. But my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given me the capacity to see Him with my ordinary human eyes nowadays.</p>

What do you do to reach the proper consciousness? Can you create or compose whenever you want to, or only when you feel a call from within?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I work with tremendous speed, I experience a limitless sea of delight inside myself. I experience the finite in myself entering into the infinite Inner Pilot Supreme. I experience the limited speed entering into the unlimited speed. I experience my limitation-bound body becoming inseparably one with my free and measureless soul-vastness and immensity. Finally, I experience the way God the creation is offering gratitude to God the Creator, and the way God the Creator is becoming exceedingly proud of God the creation.</p>
<p>In order to be in the proper consciousness for creating something that will be of value to aspiring humanity, I do not pray to God for inspiration or meditate on inspiration. Before I create something or do something most important and significant, I just meditate for God to be supremely victorious in and through the poet or the author or the singer or the artist in me.</p>
<p>I can create or compose at any moment I want to. There are two types of poets, authors, singers, artists and so forth. One type has to run after the inspiration-bird in order to catch it. The other type is divinely blessed by God’s Grace; the inspiration-bird itself flies towards him in order to be caught. But in both cases there can be difficulties. Those who run after the inspiration-bird may not succeed in catching it. Again, those who receive the inspiration-bird when it flies to them may not be soulful and grateful. Therefore, they may also fail — in their case, by not offering the utmost divinity through their creations.</p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to be able to catch the inspiration-bird at almost any time, without my having to chase it. The inspiration-bird comes to me quite often — about ninety-five times out of one hundred.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is there an abundance of gardens with exotic flowers and wonderful birds in your paintings? The inner garden or garden of the Beyond is a very happy state, but it contrasts with the problems of everyday life. It seems almost to evade them. Is this the case? What are you saying through your colourful gardens?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is there an abundance of gardens with exotic flowers and wonderful birds in your paintings? The inner garden or garden of the Beyond is a very happy state, but it contrasts with the problems of everyday life. It seems almost to evade them. Is this the case? What are you saying through your colourful gardens?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritually, a bird signifies the soul, which flies in the firmament of Infinity, and a garden represents beauty and purity. If an individual has inner beauty and purity, then easily he can remain in touch with his soul. The soul will bring him the message of freedom from bondage, on the strength of its constant and inseparable oneness with God the Omniscient, God the Omnipotent and God the Omnipresent.</p>
<p>True, in the inner life everything is happiness and beauty, whereas in the outer life the story is almost always the opposite. But in no way am I trying to avoid or evade the outer life of pain and suffering. Through colourful gardens and flowers I am trying to indicate that the outer life also can have harmony, peace, love, light and delight, for I feel that the inner life must inspire the outer life. With my heart’s aspiration and my life’s dedication I am trying to bring to the fore the beauty and purity of the inner life so that it can bring happiness to the outer life.</p>
<p>All the divine qualities that we see in the inner life eventually have to be brought to the fore in the outer life as well. God wants us to participate devotedly and soulfully in His Cosmic Game by manifesting outwardly all the divine qualities that we have within.</p>
<p>I have done thousands and thousands of paintings, and many of these also deal with the battlefield of life and the hard realities that we find there. My art-world is like a big store where each customer can choose what he likes or needs. If you need the heart’s cry, you will find it. If you need the soul’s smile, you will find it. If you need consolation, you will find it. If you need illumination, you will find it. Whatever you want, you will be able to find in my paintings.</p>
<p>In various ways I am trying to serve humanity, and it is my fervent hope that each individual will take what he or she needs from my Fountain-Art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not use any mental process to concentrate my physical and mental energies; I only invoke God’s Grace. I consciously pray for God’s Victory in my cheerful self-offering to the weightlifting world. I shall be more than happy and gratified if the results of my self-offering can become a source of inspiration to all those who are interested in weightlifting. But I have always advocated the message of self-transcendence. He who has acted in and through me can easily act in and through others as well, if such is His Will. In the process of His own evolution in and through humanity, God will far transcend the accomplishments He has achieved through me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is God Father or Mother to you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is God Father or Mother to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is both my Father and my Mother. I meditate on my Father-God for my illumination and perfection. I pray to my Mother-God for Her Compassion and Affection. When I wish to hear the song of the Infinite in the heart of the finite, I go to my Father-God. When I wish to hear the song of the finite in the soul of the Infinite, I go to my Mother-God.</p>
<p>My heart’s streaming tears in no time reach my Mother-God. My soul’s beaming joys reach my Father-God sooner than the soonest. My Mother-God proudly tells the whole world who I am: I am God’s choice instrument. My Father-God smilingly tells the whole world what my ultimate goal is. My ultimate goal is to serve both my Father-God and my Mother-God unconditionally while they are transforming today’s man into tomorrow’s God.</p>
<p>Every day in the small hours of the morning my Mother-God says to me, “How are you today, My child?” And my Father-God says to me, “What are your plans today, My son?” Late at night when I am about to retire, my Mother-God tells me, “My child, sweet dreams, sweet dreams.” And my Father-God tells me, “My son, do not dream of escaping from harsh reality. Fight bravely against ignorance-night. Be victorious! Your Mother and I are all for you.”</p>
<p>A sweet conversation in my fragrance-heart-garden: I say to my Mother-God, “Mother, You forgive me almost immediately when I do something wrong. How is it and why is it that when I do something wrong, Father, instead of forgiving me, illumines me? And that He does so slowly — although steadily and unerringly. Why, why?”</p>
<p>My Mother-God says to me, “My child, your Father is the one who has to answer this question."</p>
<p>My Father-God says to me, “My child, your Mother’s quick Forgiveness does not necessarily change your nature, but My Illumination can and does change your nature. Yes, it always does.”</p>
<p>My Mother-God says to my Father-God, “But if I do not forgive My child first, how on earth are You going to illumine him?”</p>
<p>My Father-God, heaving a smilingly tearful sigh, says, “Oh, I see! I helplessly agree with You.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV — Appendix</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV — Appendix" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Foreword to the first edition</h2>

<p>In a world where few feel totally at ease, Sri Chinmoy offers a plan for world and soul survival.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy’s deep love for God is known world-wide. Long revered as a spiritual force for peace at the United Nations, this humble, God-directed author asks the people of this planet to look within, to rediscover the essential truths of spirituality that have so blessed his own extraordinary life.</p>
<p>This book lends itself to a wide audience. Christians, Jews, Muslims and other believers will find many passages of deep insight and helpful suggestion.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy suggests that the spiritual life’s goal is self-transcendence. While man reaches up to God, God in turn reaches down to man. The connection occurs and deepens as each person aspires to open himself to the Light of God, the Will of God and a higher state of consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy believes in reincarnation. He articulates the notion that the soul progresses to a higher state in each incarnation. He roots his teachings in prayer and encourages his readers to adopt a “cheerful acceptance of the world with a view to transforming the fate and face of the world.” He beckons Westerners to avoid trying “to possess the world” while encouraging Easterners to see that “austerity isn’t the answer.”</p>
<p>He is a champion of peace, attracting believers from all religions to see the oneness of the world. He suggests that true religions are recognised by their forgiveness, tolerance, compassion, oneness and brotherhood.</p>
<p>For those trying to find their way, he proposes a form of prayer that includes: concentration, the focusing of all attention on a small object to become more aware; meditation, reflection on and identification with the vaster universe and the larger issues; and contemplation, an awareness of God so complete that one feels the oneness and love that comes from God and lives in each person and in all of creation.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy doesn’t shrink from the exigencies of everyday life. While he does promote soul growth and inner peace, he follows a long tradition of religious teachers who implore truth-seekers to exhibit and live a life of ‘dynamism’ that is transformative of this world.</p>
<p>The name Chinmoy, meaning ‘full of divine consciousness’, bespeaks the mission of this deep soul. He lives to be an unconditional instrument of God. He trusts God. There is a sympathetic oneness with God and people throughout his reflections. He becomes sad when he thinks of how people have used religion to separate themselves from one another.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy believes that God will save our world. The Light of God is stronger than the force of evil. While he has deep confidence in God, his tranquil reflections portray an urgency which calls out to mankind: “Wake up! Grow deeper! Love in such a way that ‘God’s Will be done’.”</p>
<p>I found the book to be personally helpful. In an age when stress is real and it is hard to find the proper amount of time to pray, Sri Chinmoy reminded me that placing God at the centre of my life, my work and my prayers will help me make this a better, more peaceful world and become the person of faith and love that I am called to be.</p>
