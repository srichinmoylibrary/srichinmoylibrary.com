  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can we do to bring God to people in the world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can we do to bring God to people in the world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are living in a godless world. What can we do for lovers of God who want to bring Truth and Light to earth, who want to bring God the Supreme to earth? We have to start with ourselves, in ourselves. We may see an individual standing in front of us who does not believe in God, who doubts the existence of God. But before dealing with him, we have to deal with ourselves.</p>
<p>We have the body, vital, mind and heart. Let us start by focusing our attention on the physical plane. As soon as we focus our attention on the physical plane, we see that we have lethargy, that we mix with ignorance. Then we focus our attention on the vital and we see that our vital is like a hungry wolf that wants to devour the world. But what we want from our vital is dynamism and dynamic truth, not aggression. Julius Caesar said, "I came, I saw, I conquered." Our vital says, "I came, I saw and I became." I came and I saw imperfection and then I became one with it here in the world of imperfection.</p>
<p>Then we concentrate on the mind. When we concentrate on the mind, we see that the mind is constantly doubting — doubting even our own existence. What can we do? The mind is doubting the reality within us, the reality around us. This moment the mind says I am a good man, the next moment it says I am a very bad man and the following moment it is unable to decide whether I am good or bad. The mind is always uncertain and unable to accept the truth and light. We also have a heart. This heart, on the strength of its inseparable oneness with the Absolute, can become all-divinity. But right now this heart is all-insecurity. The heart says, "God, I am not getting the thing that I want," or, "I want something to be done and it is not getting done." All the time the heart is singing the song of insecurity. But this same heart, on the strength of its oneness-capacity, can become one with the Universal Heart.</p>
<p>When I, as an individual, focus my attention on myself, I see tremendous imperfection, a tremendous need for perfection-light. Each individual must concentrate first on himself, because there is tremendous imperfection inside him. Even though the world around him may have much more imperfection than he has, as long as he is imperfect even in an infinitesimal measure, he will not be in a position to teach others. A school teacher who has more knowledge than his students can teach them even though he doesn't have the highest degree. But in the spiritual life we are making a terrible mistake if we try to teach others without being illumined ourselves. Here we are dealing with the life-principle of the individual. In school we are teaching history, geography or another particular subject, but that particular subject is not an individual's entire life; it is not his life of God-realisation. So when we see a godless attitude in someone, we have to be aware of our own capacity or incapacity. If we can perfect ourselves on the strength of our inner cry, our aspiration, our love of truth and light, then we as individuals will no longer belong to the world of imperfection. I as an individual will not belong to the world of imperfection. You as an individual will create your own world of perfection. She will create her world of perfection. In that way there will be three undivine souls less in the world and the world will be blessed with three divine souls, three divine soldiers, three divine instruments of God. Today you become perfect, tomorrow he becomes perfect, the next day I become perfect. In this way it progresses from one to many, and the whole world becomes perfect.</p>
<p>When we as individuals become good, divine and perfect, the world around us sooner or later becomes perfect, for the light that we have will not remain inside us. It will have its own spontaneous wave of self-expression. Then, with our light we will be able to see that the world around us, the world of imperfection, is being transformed and illumined. For the outer world is not outside us; it is within us. We have a mind and others in the world have a mind; but ultimately it is the same mind. The world that we see is actually inside us; it is in our mind, in our vital, in our body, in our heart. So when we become perfect within, the world without also becomes perfect.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the vital?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the vital?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two vitals in us: one is the dynamic vital and the other is the aggressive vital. The aggressive vital is the animal in us; it wants to devour the world. The dynamic vital does not want to devour; it only wants to energise the world that is fast asleep. Millions of people are still fast asleep. They are not aware of God; they are not aware of truth-light. But with the dynamic vital we can arouse slumbering humanity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we become aware of truth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we become aware of truth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through prayer and meditation. Right now this body which we claim as our own is our only truth. This body, which will live for sixty or seventy years, is our life. But when we pray and meditate, we see that this body is not our entire existence. Our entire existence is eternal life. Here on earth for seventy years we play a specific role; then we leave the body and take rest. After some time, again we will come back to earth to love God, to manifest God.</p>
<p>How can we be eternally aware of what we have within us? We can be eternally aware of our inner existence, our inner life, only through constant prayer and meditation. When we are not aware of this truth, it is as though we are sick. We have to take medicine, and this medicine is our aspiration. When we are unaware of what we have, that means we have developed a kind of disease. And in order to cure this disease, what we need is aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the relationship between Yoga and religion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the relationship between Yoga and religion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yoga is not a religion: Yoga embodies all religions. Religion has its own specific view of the truth. In religion we do not get the feeling of universal oneness. But when we accept Yoga, it is all oneness. Yoga embraces all religions. It sees religion as a house. You live in your house, I live in my house, he lives in his house. But when it is time to study, we all leave our houses and go to the same school. So Yoga is a school. Yoga is in no conflict whatsoever with religion. You come from your house, I come from my house and we shall study together.</p>
<p>Yoga will never say that this house is very bad or that house is very bad. Yoga will only say that God is in everything. But in some cases God is fully manifested in a divine way, and in some cases He is not.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> 'Aum' is God in His three aspects: God the Creator, God the Preserver and God the Destroyer. But 'Destroyer' is the wrong term. God is not the Destroyer but the Transformer. Anything that is undivine in us God transforms and illumines. 'A' represents God the Creator, 'U' represents God the Preserver and 'M' represents God the Transformer.</p>
<p>God the Creator has created us. God the Preserver preserves us. But while preserving us He notices some imperfection in us and He tries to perfect us. When He is perfecting us, He becomes God the Transformer. So when we chant 'Aum', we invoke God in His three aspects.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why did God create evil?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why did God create evil?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you call evil, that very thing I call ignorance. There is a great difference between ignorance and evil. Ignorance is an experience and this experience ultimately will lead me to a higher truth. We go from the lesser light, to the greater light, to the greatest light. What you call evil and sin are actually experiences of bondage and imperfection. Evil is in our mind. In our aspiring heart there is no such thing as evil, but only imperfection. And this imperfection can easily be perfected when we pray to God for Light, Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>I am most grateful to each of you for allowing me to be of service to you. To be of service to you is to be of service to our Eternal Father.</p>
