<p>There was once a great Hindu king who fought against the Moghuls. In every way, he was a hero supreme, and he was appreciated, admired and adored by all Indians without exception. His name was Shivaji. He wanted to have freedom for his country, specially for the part where he was born, which is called Maharashtra.</p>
<p>There are many, many authentic stories about Shivaji, but I have chosen to tell a few stories in connection with his self-sacrifice for his country and his spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Shivaji and Aurangzeb</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Shivaji and Aurangzeb" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>King Shivaji lived during the reign of the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb's father was Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife. Unfortunately, Aurangzeb was very bad. He killed all his brothers, put his father into prison and did many other terrible things. Then, towards the end of his life, he repented.</p>
<p>In 1666 Shivaji received a letter from the Emperor inviting him to come to the court at Agra. Although Shivaji knew that the Emperor was capable of treachery, he accepted because he did not want to appear to be afraid of Aurangzeb. Shivaji arrived in Agra with his eldest son, Shambhuji, and a small contingent of soldiers on the 12th of May, which happened to be the Emperor's 50th birthday.</p>
<p>When Shivaji entered the Audience Hall and placed his offerings before Aurangzeb, the Emperor did not speak a single word of welcome to him. Instead, Shivaji was led to an inferior position at the back of the hall. It now became obvious that the great Maratha hero had been led into a trap. He and his son were captives of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Shivaji was imprisoned in the Moghul capital for several months. However, he did not surrender to despair, but began making plans for his escape. One evening Shivaji and Shambhuji hid inside two huge fruit baskets. Shivaji had arranged for them to be left at a lonely spot outside the city. Shivaji and Shambhuji waited until the porters had gone and then emerged from the fruit baskets. They besmeared their bodies with ashes and made their way back to their kingdom disguised as religious mendicants.</p>

<p>On their way back to their own kingdom, Shivaji and Shambhuji stopped at a farmer's place for shelter. The farmer's mother was always hospitable to strangers and she very often gave shelter to guests.</p>
<p>While she was cooking food for them, Shivaji's Maratha fighters happened to come and plunder her farm. The woman cried out, "The real culprit is Shivaji himself! He should have died in prison or the Moghul Emperor should have killed him. Now I understand that Shivaji has escaped and he is still alive. He is the real cause of this trouble."</p>
<p>Shivaji overheard what the farmer's mother said. She did not know that her guests were none other than the King himself and his son. Shivaji said to the poor woman, "I fully agree with you. They have no right to make you suffer in this way. How much damage did these people cause?"</p>
<p>The woman added up the damage that had been done and gave Shivaji a figure. Later, when Shivaji had safely returned to his kingdom, he gave the woman double the figure she had quoted. Then he revealed that it was he who had taken shelter in her house. He told her that he was so grateful to her because unknowingly she had saved his life and that of his son.</p>

<p>After quite a few days of walking, Shivaji and his son reached a fort that belonged to Shivaji. It was Shivaji's order that the fort remain closed from sunset to dawn. No matter who came to the fort, the guard was not allowed to open the gate.</p>
<p>When King Shivaji and his son reached the fort, night had already fallen. The guard knew perfectly well that it was his King and the King's son who had come back after so many months. He also knew what kind of ordeal they had gone through. Still he would not open the gate.</p>
<p>The guard went to the roof of the fort and tied one end of a rope to a pillar. Then he climbed down the rope to the ground. As soon as he touched the ground, he fell at Shivaji's feet, crying and embracing him.</p>
<p>Shivaji was also crying because he was so proud that the guard was faithfully carrying out his order not to open the gate. The King and his son waited outside the fort until daybreak, even though the guard had the key.</p>

<p>During Shivaji's absence from the royal court, his mother, Jija Bai, was made regent. At that time, Jija Bai was very, very old and quite sick. She was a deeply religious woman and Shivaji was devoted to her. She came to hear that Shivaji had escaped in the month of August, but after four months he had not yet returned to his palace at Rajgarh. His mother was filled with worries and anxieties. Why was it taking so long for him to come back? Had he been recaptured by the Moghul soldiers?</p>
<p>One day a servant came to Jija Bai with a message. He said, "There is a mendicant at the gate who wants to see you."</p>
<p>"Fine, fine," said Jija Bai. "Bring him in."</p>
<p>Shivaji was shown into his mother's presence. He had shaved off his beard and moustache and was dressed as a sannyasin. He was so tired and exhausted from his arduous journey that he simply threw himself at his mother's feet.</p>
<p>Jija Bai was surprised that a sannyasin should behave in this manner. "What do you want?" she asked.</p>
<p>"What do I want?" cried Shivaji. Then he started sobbing, "Mother, you cannot recognise me?" and he laid his head on Jija Bai's lap.</p>
<p>At last Jija Bai recognised that it was her long-lost son. Her tearful joy and Shivaji's tearful joy mingled together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The elephant bodyguards</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The elephant bodyguards" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This is a striking incident in King Shivaji's life. A neighbouring king invited him to pay a visit and so Shivaji and his entourage went to see this king. During their meeting, Shivaji noticed that this particular king kept quite a few bodyguards plus two or three elephants beside him.</p>
<p>Shivaji asked the King, "Where is the need for these elephants? Here, we two are friends. You do not need protection."</p>
<p>The King answered, "I have to be prepared. If an enemy comes even at this very moment, my elephants will charge and trample that person."</p>
<p>"Am I then your enemy?" asked Shivaji.</p>
<p>"No," said his royal friend, "you are my true friend. But I have to be wise. The elephants are my bodyguards."</p>
<p>"Oh, these are your bodyguards," said Shivaji, quite puzzled.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the King. Then he added, "Tell me, Shivaji, do you not keep bodyguards?"</p>
<p>"Certainly!" said Shivaji. "But I do not keep elephant bodyguards. I have human bodyguards."</p>
<p>"Can human bodyguards protect you if an entire army comes to attack you?" queried the King.</p>
<p>"My human bodyguards can protect me against any untoward events," insisted Shivaji. Then Shivaji asked one of his bodyguards to step forward.</p>
<p>The other King laughed. "Are you saying that this bodyguard alone can challenge and defeat my huge elephant?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he can," said Shivaji.</p>
<p>The other King felt that this debate had gone on long enough. He said, "All right, Shivaji, ask your bodyguard to kill my elephant here and now."</p>
<p>Shivaji gave the command and the bodyguard went and stood directly in front of the elephant. The elephant became enraged and charged the bodyguard, who turned and ran away. The other King was very satisfied with the outcome of the engagement, but it was far from over. In a tricky way, the bodyguard circled the elephant unnoticed and then he stepped forward and cut its trunk with his sword. The elephant's trunk was bleeding profusely and it was in extreme agony. Finally, in front of the two Kings and all those who had assembled, it lay down and died.</p>
<p>Shivaji calmly said to his host, "Here is the proof that my man-elephant is infinitely stronger than your animal-elephant. That is why I need only my human bodyguards."</p>

<p>Shivaji used to have only one meal a day. He would eat something that is like what we call biryani. It was rice and dhal mixed together and boiled in butter. Shivaji did not eat meat.</p>
<p>Once Shivaji had some English guests at his court. They were voracious meat eaters. Even though Shivaji and most of his followers did not eat meat, he was kind enough to satisfy his guests by preparing meat dishes for them.</p>

<p>Once Shivaji wrote a letter to the great poet-saint Tukaram, inviting him to come to his palace. Shivaji had heard much about the saint and had developed the highest admiration for him.</p>
<p>But Tukaram declined his invitation. He sent a message back, "O King, you have invited me to come to your palace, but I do not find any necessity to come. You will present me with gifts, but I do not need anything from you. If I want to eat, there are trees bearing fruits. When I walk along the street, I see that people have discarded their old and used clothes. I can use them if I need clothes. If I want shelter, there are many caves all around. What else do I need on earth? I cannot accept your invitation, and I do not need anything from you."</p>
<p>Shivaji immediately realised his mistake and he went personally to see Tukaram, walking barefoot to honour the saint.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">In search of a Guru</h2><span property="dc:title" content="In search of a Guru" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day King Shivaji was told by a wise friend, "Without a Guru, there can be no salvation. You need a Guru."</p>
<p>Outwardly, King Shivaji was performing his duties as sovereign extremely well, in spite of the fact that his life was full of responsibilities. But inwardly he felt that something was missing. He used to visit temples quite often and he was religious in the strict sense of the term. But without a spiritual guide, he was unable to enter into deep prayer and meditation. So he began to search for a Guru.</p>
<p>Shivaji came to learn of a particular saint. Three times he went to see the saint, only to find that the saint was not available. The saint was evading him. Finally, Shivaji asked one of the saint's devotees where her Master actually was. She told Shivaji to go to a certain village. Shivaji went there and found the saint sitting under a tree with a few of his disciples. After the saint had finished singing devotional songs, Shivaji humbly approached him and begged to be accepted as his disciple.</p>
<p>The saint said, "I accept you as my disciple."</p>
<p>Then Shivaji begged the saint to come and live at his palace, but the saint said, "Oh no, I cannot come to your palace. You are a king. Your duty is to protect your subjects. My duty is to pray and worship. I shall stay here. You can come and visit me from time to time."</p>
<p>In obedience to his Master's will, King Shivaji agreed to return to his palace and resume his duties. He was so happy that at last he had found his spiritual Master. The name of this saint was Ramdas and the year was 1672 A.D.</p>

<p>Once pride entered into Shivaji. He was building a fort and he became very proud that this huge project was supporting 5,000 families. When Shivaji paid a visit to Ramdas, he spoke about the fort with his beloved Guru.</p>
<p>Ramdas saw and felt the pride in his disciple, so he showed Shivaji a particular rock. The rock had an opening in it and inside there was a small pool of water. Out of the water jumped a frog.</p>
<p>"Who is supporting and protecting this little frog?" asked Ramdas.Shivaji's pride vanished. He realised that it is only God who protects and preserves His creation.</p>

<p>One day King Shivaji left his palace to visit his Master. As usual, his Master was not available. Somebody informed Shivaji that his Master was in a nearby village and Shivaji immediately went there. When Shivaji approached his Master, he saw that Ramdas was in tremendous pain. He was suffering from all kinds of ailments and it seemed that he could not live much longer.</p>
<p>Shivaji was very distressed to see his Master in this condition. He said to him, "Please, please tell me what I can do for you. I can bring any doctor in my kingdom to cure you."</p>
<p>Ramdas replied, "No doctor can cure me."</p>
<p>The King asked, "Is there nothing that can be done? Is there nobody who can cure your suffering? I am the King and I am your disciple. There must be something that I can do for you."</p>
<p>"Nobody can do anything," repeated Ramdas.</p>
<p>"I feel that I can do something," insisted Shivaji.</p>
<p>"All right," said Ramdas at last, "if you can bring me the milk of a tigress, then only will I be cured."</p>
<p>Shivaji exclaimed at once, "That is nothing!"</p>
<p>"If it is nothing, then you try to do it," said Ramdas.</p>

<p>Shivaji went into the densest forest. There he saw two little tiger cubs and he grabbed them. He thought, "If I keep them with me, then naturally the mother will come looking for them."</p>
<p>In a few minutes, the tigress returned and saw that a human being had seized her cubs. She became furious and sprang on Shivaji, wounding him with her claws. But Shivaji was very strong and he was determined not to be killed by the tigress. While they were wrestling together, he begged her inwardly to offer him some of her milk. Strangely enough, the tigress heard his prayer and she did give him some milk.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, the King went back to his Master and offered him the milk. Ramdas drank it and was cured then and there. Then Ramdas shared with his devoted disciple just a little portion of the milk because the King's body was scratched and bleeding. When the King drank it, his pain immediately vanished.</p>
<p>Modern science will not believe this unique experience in King Shivaji's life. If you use the mind, you will be the last person to believe it, but if you use the heart, you are bound to believe that such things can take place. This story is one hundred per cent true.</p>

<p>When Shivaji went to see Ramdas, he used to massage his Guru's entire body. One day, while he was devotedly massaging Ramdas, he said, "Master, I am so sick and tired of ruling this kingdom. I am not getting any peace."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "I am giving you a small piece of my ochre cloth. From now on, you should use the ochre cloth for your banner. Ochre is the colour of renunciation. You will rule and guide all your subjects with utmost compassion and love, and at the same time you will feel that it is I who am guiding you. In you and through you I shall protect and guide your kingdom."</p>
<p>Shivaji accepted his Guru's advice wholeheartedly. After that, he always used as his flag a simple piece of ochre fabric without any decoration.</p>

<p>Once Shivaji went to a temple. To his great astonishment, he saw his Master at the temple gate begging for alms. People were giving him a little rice, some coins and so on. When the King saw his beloved Master reduced to begging, he wrote something down on a small piece of paper and put it in his Master's bowl.</p>
<p>Ramdas was curious to see what his disciple had written. He opened the note and read: "I am placing my kingdom at your feet. I am here and I want to be your slave."</p>
<p>Ramdas asked Shivaji, "Do you mean it?"</p>
<p>"I mean it," replied Shivaji. "I am not going back to my kingdom. I shall remain here at your feet. I am your servant. Please tell your servant what to do."</p>
<p>So Ramdas started ordering Shivaji about at random, saying, "Do this, do that." The King did everything his Master asked, even the most menial work.</p>
<p>Finally, Ramdas beckoned Shivaji to come to him. "Why are you doing this, my son?" he asked. "Do you not know that you are a king?"</p>
<p>Shivaji shook his head. "I am not a king. I am your slave now."</p>
<p>"But are you happy?" asked Ramdas.</p>
<p>Shivaji answered, "You cannot imagine my joy! To be at your feet and to listen to your command is the highest delight. You have made me the happiest person."</p>
