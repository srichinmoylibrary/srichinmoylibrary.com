<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not bad at all. If you have to sleep after meditation you can go to sleep, but if you can continue meditating from two to five without going back to sleep, that is infinitely better. But if that is not possible for you right now, if you can meditate for an hour, then the result of your meditation you can assimilate after your meditation.</p>
<p>The only difficulty is that if you meditate from two to three or four o'clock, then afterwards there will be quite a few hours before you get up. If you get up at nine or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at two o'clock, then between seven and eight the vital forces — your own vital forces or the aggression of the earth which is agitated at seven or eight o'clock — will cause your consciousness to become agitated. The agitation from the earth's consciousness or from your own lower vital can enter into the results of the meditation which you did at two o'clock or three o'clock. So after your meditation, either you have to have a very peaceful sleep or you have to get up again at five or six o'clock. If you get up at nine o'clock or ten o'clock, just because you meditated at three o'clock, then the agitation and the hustle and bustle of life around you can disturb you totally.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful. For an hour or so, from two to three, you can meditate and then you can sleep again from three to five. But please be awake by six o'clock. Otherwise the consciousness of the earth, which becomes awakened and agitated at that time, can create a disturbance in your consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the morning, if you are really concentrating well on a particular idea, then the idea itself has strength and power in it. But afterwards you have to execute it. If you do not try to execute it, then it will die. It is like a beautiful flower. Immediately you have to place it on the altar; otherwise, the flower will only wither and die. Each thought is a type of flower. After a few hours, it will lose all its beauty and fragrance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the time being just remain in a meditative mood and read spiritual writings or sing devotional songs. If you have been meditating for one hour, then after two or three months you can increase the length of time, but do not increase it suddenly. Even if you are inspired, please increase your meditation time by degrees. Otherwise, if today you meditate well and you meditate for another hour, then in a subtle way pride enters. Pride is your worst enemy. You will be bloated with pride the whole day, and then the following day this pride will not allow you to meditate at all. You will think that you have got everything from your meditation, so for two weeks you won't get up. Meditation is just like eating. No matter how much you eat today, tomorrow again you have to eat to get energy. So do not overeat. Please go slowly. If you have to, increase your time only by two or three minutes. Then after a month or so you can increase it ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, do not jump from half an hour to one hour. Continue for one month, two months or three months meditating for the same length of time. Otherwise one day you will meditate for half an hour more and the next day you may not meditate even for one second. So it is like eating or taking exercise. One day you will eat too much and the next day you will have stomach problems. Or if you have the capacity to do five push-ups and then one day you get inspired and do twenty, the following day you won't even be able to go to the gym because your arms will feel broken; they will be full of pain. So always increase your capacity slowly; then you will have no difficulty.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, this time is important because that is the hour that you have fixed. If your time to meditate is 4:30 in the morning, at that hour your soul will knock at your door — like a punctual newspaper boy — so you had better be prepared. Choose the time that you feel is best and stick to it. The best time for you people is some time after 4:30 am. Yesterday you may have meditated at four o'clock, another day at two o'clock, another day at five o'clock, some days even at nine o'clock — but is it real meditation? At two o'clock in the morning or any time before 4:30, it is not possible for you to meditate well, because you will be tired. So disciples should get up and meditate between the hours of 4:30 am and 6:45 am. After seven o'clock I know the consciousness of America: it is in a hustle and bustle mood.</p>
<p>Please meditate at the time you are supposed to. If you change your time every day or if you have not meditated, I will catch you people in the inner worlds, because I have realised God and you have not. So please become like an Indian farmer and plough your fields, your meditation fields, every day at the same hour.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get up half an hour earlier in order to shower and get ready, but then you must start to meditate at your appointed time. Sometimes it is good to read my writings for a few minutes or sing some spiritual songs to prepare yourself inwardly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you were working at our gallery, no matter how tired you were, if I asked you to get me something to drink, you just ran. Why? There are two reasons. One is that people were there to appreciate you if you did the thing, and because you wanted appreciation, you did it. The other reason is that you felt the inner need to do it. If you remain in the physical and vital, you do something because people will appreciate you. But if you remain on the soul's level, then you will do it out of inner devotion, inner need.</p>
<p>If I spend four hours playing volleyball, then I will develop some capacity; but that capacity I cannot apply to ping-pong. So try to develop some capacity to meditate in the same way that you have developed the capacity to do other things.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the highest spiritual point of view there is no outer explanation. Most of the people who will come, I feel, will not be truly advanced seekers. It is only that I am executing the Supreme's command. But on the physical plane and on the mental plane I can say that some people can meditate for only five minutes when they try to meditate for, say, an hour. If these people were asked to meditate only for five minutes, then they would not be able to meditate at all. So during these seven hours, instead of only five minutes, some people will have all together an hour or forty-five minutes of deep meditation.</p>
