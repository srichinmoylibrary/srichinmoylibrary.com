<p>After they crossed the finish line, at least seven or eight of the race-walkers immediately vomited. One South Indian fellow was very short and thin. He walked 30 metres past the finish line, and then he lay down on the ground, panting and vomiting. People were calling for the ambulance, which was only a hundred metres away. But the driver was missing. Meanwhile, nobody was coming to his rescue.</p>
<p>So, with my back pain and fever, I went to help the man. With greatest difficulty I knelt down on the ground and started massaging his right foot. God knows if he had pain there! For four or five minutes I massaged him here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>Two or three times he kicked me. I know what I go through when the boys massage me sometimes. I don't kick them physically, but inwardly perhaps I do. Finally the ambulance came, and three men picked him up and took him away to the hospital. While they were putting him in the ambulance, he was mercilessly kicking them.</p>

<p>After that, I continued watching the walking races. In one race, two Bengalis stood first and second. One finished at least three minutes behind the other. But the judges mixed it up, and declared the second-place winner first.</p>
<p>When they made the announcement, everybody started laughing. The judges got mad because they felt they could not make such a mistake. The one who stood second went to the judge and said, "I was far behind him."</p>
<p>The judge said, "I don't want to hear that."</p>
<p>So the one who was second went and embraced the one who really had stood first. He said, "What can we do?"</p>
<p>The other one said, "Let us go out for a cup of coffee."</p>
<p>The wives of the first and second finishers were roaring with laughter. Fortunately the couples were good friends. So all four of them went out for a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I couldn't believe the fellow who stood first in the long jump! I used to do it in four steps, but now I would die if I tried. All the competitors were old men like me, but I wouldn't dare to try it.</p>
<p>When I saw the javelin competition, I felt sorry that I didn't join. Perhaps I would have won. But they used a 16-pound shot for the shot-put. The man from Thailand who stood first was three times my size. He threw it so far!</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock I went back for my famous T-shirt, but the manager, Ghuli, was not to be found in the office. He was in the playground, not paying any attention to the time. For an hour I wasted time, then I went to another office to get the immortal T-shirt. They said, "Ghuli is very busy right now."</p>
<p>I watched a few more races and went back again. Finally I got mad. My fever was escalating like anything. I said, "I am going to say nasty things in America about how corrupt Indians are."</p>
<p>Then I saw the first Sardar-ji, Jogendra, the man who bad been kind to me and who had introduced me to Ghuli. He happened to be the Secretary of All-India Athletics for the Veterans. He saw me going away, so he asked me, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am sick of Indians. They are all liars!"</p>
<p>He grabbed me and said, "We are not so bad." I said, "Yes, you are all like that."</p>
<p>Then he took me into a room and said, "Now sit down and say anything you like against us."</p>
<p>I told him, "Do I need this T-shirt? I paid for it, and three or four times I have tried to get it." I went on like this and insulted everybody, while he listened to me. "Also, I wanted to meet Milka Singh, and the manager didn't want to be bothered with that."</p>
<p>In the same room there was a very old man, an Indian reporter and a very tall Sikh, who was sitting on a chair. All of a sudden the Sikh came over to me. He said, "You have come to the right person."</p>
<p>I said, "Everybody says that he is the right person, but nobody has been able to help me. They just send me here and there like a football. Now tell me who you are."</p>
<p>The tall man said, "I am Milka Singh."</p>
<p>I said, "You are Milka Singh? I was your great admirer." Then I started telling him about his athletic achievements.</p>
<p>He said, "You say Indians are bad. But others are even worse." Then we had a long chat. We talked for about an hour, and he told me many stories about his career.</p>

<p>Then Milka Singh said, "Next year the Veterans Games will take place in Puerto Rico. I will be going there with a delegation. I hope they do a better job and make better arrangements.</p>
<p>"They have elected me president, so I am blamed for everything here. I don't get any salary, but every day I get a heart attack. Is there anybody who does not curse me? The higher you go, the worse your punishment is. What can I do? People are turning me insane."</p>
<p>At this point the reporter wanted to interview me. I said, "Please forgive me. I am not interested now. I am speaking to this man."</p>
<p>Then I told Milka Singh, "You won't believe it, but I am going to inaugurate the games in Puerto Rico with a silent meditation and a brief message."</p>
<p>I still had my <em>Galaxy of Luminaries.</em> I showed him Governor Colon's picture and Governor Ferre's picture. He said, "You are a great man. Can I have this book?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am autographing it for you." So I dedicated the booklet to him. I gave him my phone number in Puerto Rico and my private phone number in New York. I said, "When you are in Puerto Rico, you will be my guest, along with the members of your delegation."</p>

<p>From where to where! Milka Singh started introducing me to everybody.</p>
<p>One of the people be introduced me to was the President of the Singapore Athletics Association His name was Chandra. When Milka Singh told him, "He will meditate to inaugurate the games in Puerto Rico," Chandra grabbed me and said, "You have to sit with my delegation today in our box." He wouldn't allow me to sit with the Indians. Then he also started telling people what a great man I was.</p>
<p>Then the President of the Athletics Association in Thailand started speaking to me in broken English. He said, "May I speak to you for a while?"</p>
<p>Suddenly I had become a big shot. I said to Milka Singh, "I have come here for a T-shirt — don't forget!"</p>
<p>Milka Singh said, "Definitely you will get a T-shirt, but I really want to honour you. Please don't curse us."</p>

<p>Because of Milka Singh's position, not a single person had any gratitude for him. Even the 91-year-old man who had been sitting in the office with him when I first came in was cursing him.</p>
<p>The old man said he had come in first in his event but that the judges had made a mistake and given the first prize to somebody else.</p>
<p>The old man was short, quite fat and odd-looking. His eyes were frightening.</p>

<p>I went with my friend Chandra to watch the races with the Singapore delegation for about two hours. Chandra told me, "My daughter Gloria is running the 200 metres. She has a six-year-old son." He said she was the best.</p>
<p>Gloria came and sat down and talked to me. While she was talking, she was putting Vaseline over her whole body. I was laughing to myself, saying, "Why should someone need Vaseline? Is it a marathon?" And in India it is so warm!</p>
<p>Chandra was right. In the 200 metres she finished 40 metres ahead of the second finisher, who was from Nepal. The Indian runners were far behind her. The Singapore athletes badly defeated the Indians.</p>
<p>Chandra was supposed to run 200 metres and the 400-metre hurdles, and I was supposed to take his picture. While I was looking for him through the camera lens, he finished the race. Then he came back and everybody was congratulating him because be stood first.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Did you run?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, I ran. What were you doing?"</p>
<p>I said, "I was holding the camera, but I could not see you."</p>
<p>Afterwards, they took our picture standing together.</p>

<p>In one 100-metre race, there was a false start, but all the runners continued running anyway. The starter fired the gun twice, the judges and even the audience were screaming for them to stop, but they completed the whole hundred metres! Then after five minutes they had to run it again.</p>

<p>Finally I became tired. I said to myself, "They are supposed to be honouring me, but this is just another joke. All right, Milka Singh was kind to me, but still I have not got my T-shirt. If I go to him again, be will just ask me to sit."</p>
<p>I was not angry; in fact, I was pleased. And I knew that if I went to Milka Singh, he would still honour me. But my fever was very high. So I left my friends from Singapore and secretly started going away.</p>
<p>I was almost at the last exit when whom did I see? Jogendra! He was the one who had been so kind to me and introduced me to the manager, Ghuli. He asked me, "Are you going away?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I am tired."</p>
<p>He said, "Let me take you to Ghuli. This time he will give you the T-shirt."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I do not wish to speak to Ghuli. I would like to see Milka Singh again, but he is busy."</p>
<p>He said, "Milka Singh? I don't deal with him. You have to see Ghuli."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't want to see Ghuli."</p>
<p>This Sardar-ji had been there in the room when Milka Singh said be would honour me. So he reminded me, "Milka Singh has not yet honoured you."</p>
<p>I said, "I have a high fever. I would like to go home."</p>
<p>But Jogendra just took my arm and brought me back to Milka Singh. Milka Singh sat me down. This time I did not say anything about the T-shirt. I only said, "I am sick."</p>
<p>Milka Singh told me, "You have to stay. In five minutes we shall honour you."</p>
<p>Just then Milka Singh's secretary came to me with a T-shirt and placed it on my lap, very gently, and smiled at me.</p>
<p>I thanked him profusely.</p>
<p>So the famous T-shirt story finally ended.</p>
<p>If I hadn't been so persistent in my T-shirt quest, I wouldn't have met Milka Singh.</p>

<p>In about five minutes' time I heard an announcement over the loudspeaker, "Sri Chinmoy, a man of peace and a world-renowned athlete, is now going to present the prizes for the 20-kilometre walk. He will be escorted by the President of the All-India Veterans Association."</p>
<p>At the centre of the stadium were three girls wearing beautiful saris — not cotton, but silk. They held golden dishes, and the medals were lying on the dishes. The first, second and third place finishers stood behind the girls.</p>
<p>There were also three musicians with bugles. They marched in from one side, and I was escorted to the centre of the stadium from the other side by the big shot.</p>
<p>The person who came in first stood on the top platform in the middle. The second and third place finishers were on either side. We faced the winners. The man who escorted me would go to each girl to get the appropriate medal, and then give it to me. Then I would go and present the medal to the athlete.</p>
<p>The first one bowed halfway down. I put the medal on him like a garland and shook hands with him. Then I did this for the second and third place finishers. Then we all stood facing the audience.</p>
<p>I was on one end, and the President of the All-India Veterans Association was on the other end. The girls were standing near the President. Then the first place winner raised the hands of the second and third place winners, while the buglers played for two minutes.</p>
<p>When that was over I wanted to go, but Milka Singh said, "No, you have to wait. I want you to see the Prime Minister. She will come here in a few minutes. I will try my best to introduce you, but I can't promise. Anyway, you can't leave yet." So I remained there with the other big shots waiting to meet the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In five minutes again they announced my name. This time they said, "Sri Chinmoy of the United States will present the prizes for 400-metre hurdles. We are so happy to have him here. He will be escorted by the Commander of the Air Force." So the Air Force Commander escorted me into the stadium.</p>
<p>Again there were three girls, the buglers and the winners. This time the Commander gave me the medals, and I gave them to the winners. In the 400-metre hurdles, the first place finisher in his age-group was my friend from Singapore, Chandra.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Indira Gandhi did come. I was sifting in the last row, and she came and sat not even a metre away from me. I turned and looked at her. She was wearing a cotton sari that was simpler than the simplest. She looked very tired and exhausted. She said, "Oh, I am so tired."</p>
<p>In three or four minutes they announced over the loudspeaker: "Our beloved Prime Minister Indira Gandhi will now give the prizes for the discus." During the announcement I was looking at her with folded hands. When she got up and started walking, everybody folded his hands.</p>
<p>She went down to the same place I had just been and gave the prizes for the discus. She also presented the prizes to the gold medalists of the previous meet in Singapore. Then the 91-year-old man came up to her to say something.</p>
<p>Milka Singh, who is so tall, was all the time bowing with folded hands — trying to come down to her height. At that time Ghuli, the manager, was nowhere to be seen; it was only Milka Singh who was with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Then the Prime Minister disappeared and the story ended. Like me, there were four other persons sitting together who were supposed to meet her. But none of us got to see her.</p>
<p>There is one thing I would like to say about her: she definitely has a soulful smile — more so than any other big shot I have seen.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Speaking My Mother Tongue</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Speaking My Mother Tongue" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I was leaving the stadium, the editor of a Bengali sports magazine said to me, "Sri Chinmoy, are you Bengali?" My surname is Ghose, so he knew I was Bengali.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said, "Can you speak Bengali?"</p>
<p>So I started speaking to him in Bengali. He said, "But can you read Bengali?" Since the announcer said I was from the United States, he thought that I didn't really know Bengali.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said. "Certainly I can read Bengali."</p>
<p>To have me prove I could read Bengali, he gave me his magazine. So I started reading out a little. Then he said, "I wish to give this magazine to you. Please write a few words to me from America."</p>
<p>It was such a thick magazine, with many pictures. I only kept the cover and his address. It was too heavy to carry back to New York.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Priceless Photographs</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Priceless Photographs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I had with me a silly Indian camera. The first person who escorted me to give the prizes took my camera and gave it to one of his friends.</p>
<p>Later, my friend from Thailand came up to me and said, "Let us have our picture taken together." A photographer who was there took our picture.</p>
<p>My friend said, "Can we have our pictures developed?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am ready to pay, but I don't want to go to the photograpber."</p>
<p>So he went to get the photograpber, and brought him over to me. I asked, "How much do you want to print the pictures for us?"</p>
<p>The photographer said, "Ten rupees."</p>
<p>I said, "I will be leaving tomorrow morning. If I give you 200 rupees, will you bring my copies to the hotel by 9:30? Then I will leave some for my friend."</p>
<p>The photographer agreed. But the next morning, 9:30 came and went, and finally it was twelve o'clock and I had to leave. So I had to write a note for my friend, who was staying at another hotel, telling him that the photographer never came.</p>
<p>I said, "What am I going to do? He didn't care for 200 rupees."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Massage Artist</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Massage Artist" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Bangkok I was looking for someone to massage my back. But in the Grace Hotel, where I was staying, they only had ladies who gave massage. I said, "Thank you very much, but no thank you."</p>
<p>I started calling other hotels. Finally, the Ambassador Hotel told me they had a man who gave massage, so I went there for a massage.</p>
<p>The man who gave massage had been to Australia to learn Russian massage, Chinese massage and general massage. In Indian currency, he charged 120 rupees.</p>
<p>When he first saw me, he said, "You are a Hindu! I can tell from your name. But I am a Muslim."</p>
<p>I said, "Who cares whether you are a Muslim or a Hindu? There is only one God."</p>
<p>He said, "I also feel that."</p>
<p>At first he did Chinese massage, using his elbow. How painful! Then be tried Russian massage. I was lying down, and suddenly he jumped on my back and began jogging on it. I let him go from the base of my spine to my shoulder blades. But when he got to my shoulders, my chest was hurting so much that I asked him to stop. I said, "Russian massage is the worst!"</p>
<p>Then he gave me a general massage. After that I asked him, "Can you come to my hotel at 8 o'clock tonight? I will give you more money."</p>
<p>He agreed, and took down my room number.</p>
