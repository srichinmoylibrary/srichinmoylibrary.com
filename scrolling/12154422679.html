<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is not a single nation that is completely divine. Just like human beings, some nations are more divine than others because they have more good qualities. Similarly, some nations may have more bad qualities than other nations. But when it is a matter of an absolutely perfect nation, there is not a single nation that is absolutely divine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Self-criticism you can take as a thorn that has entered into you. You are very bad, undivine, stupid. You feel that all the bad qualities of the world are inside you. Take this self-criticism as a thorn. One thorn has entered into you, and it has many names. One moment it is stupidity, the next moment it is insecurity, and so on. So what you have to do is take the help of another thorn. That thorn is: “I am God’s daughter, God’s chosen daughter, and I am going to be His perfect instrument. There is nothing on earth which can prevent me from becoming His chosen instrument.” You use this thorn to take out the other thorn that is causing you trouble. Self-criticism can only be conquered by proper divine appreciation. You have to claim the right person as your own. God is your Source. You have to take the positive approach. You have to be aware of who you are and what you stand for, not in an aggressive sense, but in a spiritual sense. Right now, you are not aware twenty-four hours a day. But a day will come when you will be aware all the time that you are God’s chosen daughter; you are on earth Him to serve, Him to fulfil.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual and the way one utilises the experiences. If it is an experience of failure and we use it as an opportunity to perfect our nature, then we are nearing our goal. If it is an experience of success and we use the experience to inspire us toward greater perfection, then we are also nearing our goal. There is no hard and fast rule that says we will learn more from failure or more from success; it is only how we utilise the experience.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we know when we do things wrong?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we know when we do things wrong?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very often we do not know that we are doing something wrong until after some time. On rare occasions, when undivine desires compel us to do something, we feel that the soul is speaking to us. At that time, we are so much attached to our vital desires that we feel that it is the light that is compelling us to act. Then, after a few months or a few years, we realise that we have made a mistake, that it was not the soul but the vital that instigated us. Again, in spite of knowing that we are doing something wrong, many times we continue to do it because we feel that the pleasure-life is more important and more fascinating than the life of joy. But eventually we have to come to perfection.</p>
<p>Each so-called mistake takes us one step ahead. We can see that perhaps two years ago we were quarrelling and fighting and leading an animal life. Let us think of our animal incarnation, or even what we were ten years ago. But now we are aware that God is evolving in and through us.</p>
<p>If one is brave enough to accept his weaknesses and seek to overcome them, he makes the fastest progress. But people are not like that. We want to cover our weaknesses. In spite of knowing that flattery is very bad for us, when people do flatter us, we like it. But the Supreme never becomes sad, because He knows that sooner or later He will be given the chance to help us transcend our weaknesses and grow into perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is the tree. A tree will not have only one branch. If you see a tree with only one branch and you also see a tree that has several branches, which one will you appreciate? A father may have only one son. Again, what is wrong if the father has two sons? You can’t say that a father cannot have more than one son. If the father does have more than one child, then one son can be a doctor, one can be an engineer, one can be a poet. But if he has only one son, then that son cannot be everything. Let us take God as a human being. If the human father has more than one son, then he can accomplish many things in and through his children. If he has only one son, that person can do only a few things.</p>
<p>God wants to manifest Himself on earth. We feel that if the kingdom of Heaven has to be brought down to earth, it is a very big task. If we have to bring God-consciousness down to earth, then we need more than one person. Each one is equally important. We will not say that the Christ is not as important as Sri Krishna. Never, never. They are both equally important. It is like the left hand and the right hand. If I am in a tug-of-war, then shall I use only my one hand? I will use both hands. So Sri Krishna, the Buddha, the Christ are all hands of God. God has to utilise all His hands.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is contemplation what develops when we do breathing exercises?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is contemplation what develops when we do breathing exercises?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There art three stages: concentration, meditation and contemplation. Now, we should start with breathing exercises. Physical postures and deep breathing we have to do even before concentration, even before we enter into the subject, let us say. First we relax our body and try to breathe deeply. When we are breathing in and out, we have to do it so gently that if we place a thread in front of our nose, then it will not move to and fro. At that time, we can feel that our breathing is perfect for concentration. Then, when we concentrate, we have to feel that we are focusing our attention on one subject or one object. The mind is not roaming; mental thoughts have all ceased. When this happens, when there are no thoughts, no ideas, concentration is perfect. And then we feel the necessity for meditation.</p>
<p>When we enter into meditation, we see vastness before us, all around us, and we try to enter into that vastness or let it enter into us. Finally, we enter into contemplation. That is the last stage, when we become what we have been aspiring for. For a long time we have been aspiring to become something, to grow into something. When we contemplate, at that time the knower becomes the Known, the lover becomes the Beloved Himself and the finite becomes the Infinite. Each becomes part and parcel of each other.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a very high experience. About this kind of experience we say, “He moves, He moves not”. Look at the sea. If you dive deep within, it is calm and quiet. But on the surface you will see such huge waves all the time restless and dancing. The sea has two aspects. On the surface it is constant movement and at the bottom it is silence. Similarly, when you become really advanced and realise God, inside you there will be total, complete tranquility even while you are involved in multifarious outer activities. Your inner poise is not disturbed by outer activities.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable for seekers, especially in the beginning, to cry for the personal God. The impersonal God is very difficult to approach. When a seeker tries to approach God in His impersonal aspect, he enters into false imagination. Imagination is not bad, but it can be all mental fantasies. But if one starts with the personal God and then lets the personal God show His other form, the impersonal form, at that time it is easy.</p>
<p>If a child sees his father personally, he will be more happy than if he just knows how much strength, peace or light the father has. The child doesn’t care for these things. As long as he sees the father in the physical, in the human body, in the personal form, then he is satisfied. But again, if the child wants to see the father’s capacity, if he wants to see how much weight the father can lift or how much he can do in the mental world, then this is the impersonal way of seeing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The peace that I bring down is dynamic peace. If you have God’s Peace, this peace is creation, inner creation, continual creation. When you fall asleep, you don’t receive anything. You get absolutely nothing. Only if you fall asleep after meditating, sometimes you have assimilation. But if you don’t receive anything from meditation, then what will rest do? If you have not received anything, then how can you assimilate during your sleep? You are not aspiring; you are sleeping. If you don’t meditate well and then you sleep, do you think an angel will drop from Heaven and meditate for you? No! No angel is going to do that.</p>
