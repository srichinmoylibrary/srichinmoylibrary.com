  <h2 id="page-title">The Japanese robin</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Japanese robin" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I went to a pet shop that had three Japanese robins. I wanted to buy two, but the lady said, "Don't buy two, buy one."</p>
<p>I asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>She answered, "If you buy two, they won't sing. Only buy one; then it will sing. When they are alone, they sing a lot. But if you have two or three, as we have here, they don't sing."</p>
<p>The price was thirty dollars. I asked her, "Can you reduce the price?"</p>
<p>She was so nice. She said, "I have to ask my boss."</p>
<p>Her boss came over to me and I asked her, "Can you make the price a little less?"</p>
<p>The boss said, "Oh, twenty-five dollars." I agreed, "All right. I will buy it for twenty-five dollars."</p>
<p>The bird started flying all over the store, and with greatest difficulty the saleslady caught it. When she brought it to the register, her boss said, "I am going out now. I will be back in a few minutes."</p>
<p>As soon as her boss left, the saleslady rang up twenty dollars on the register.</p>
<p>I said, "Why, it is twenty-five, not twenty." She just gave me a smile. I continued, "But your boss didn't agree to twenty. She said for twenty-five I can have it."</p>
<p>The saleslady gave it to me for twenty. She was so nice to me. And she was right; the bird sang for three days in the car. For fifteen minutes it would sing one song, then another song. Japanese robins sing different songs with different notes. At least twenty times we heard it sing.</p>
<p>Before this incident, I had gone to another store where the owner was so rude. They had a beautiful parrot. I made him an offer, but he said, "No! It's about a hundred dollars."</p>
<p>I said, "But I'll give you American dollars,"</p>
<p>He exclaimed, "What?"</p>
<p>I said, "Perhaps you know that American dollars are worth more."</p>
<p>He said, "What does it mean? So what!"</p>
<p>I said, "Come to America. Then you will see."</p>
<p>These people are all rogues. In so many places they don't give the right exchange rate for the American dollar.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Practising what you preach</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Practising what you preach" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Toronto there was a two-mile race. I had already run a lot early in the morning before the race, so I was very tired and exhausted. Also, I didn't have any energy because I had not been eating solid food. But I started running anyway.</p>
<p>There were about twenty-five runners in the race. Four girls who were running started to pass me. I said, "I have no more strength to run. I preach all the time 'surrender, surrender, surrender' to my disciples. Now God wants me to practice it." O God, one, two, three, four — the girls all went ahead of me. Then, after one mile, one by one I caught three of them. But one girl was still ahead of me. After a mile and a half, O God, I had absolutely no energy left. I started walking very nicely and the girls whom I had passed went ahead. I said, "Oh, now I am practising and practising. Not only do I preach surrender but I practise it also."</p>
<p>A young man, a new disciple who still has long hair and a moustache, came up to me near the end of the race and said, "Guru, I want to run with you because I want peace. I am getting so much peace from you."</p>
<p>I thought, "Oh, he is getting peace and I am dying."</p>
<p>So, near the finish line, when I started walking, he also started walking. Then about a hundred metres from the end I told him, "Now, please, you go and run. Finish it running." So he completed the two-mile race running.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Devotees from the Indian Consulate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Devotees from the Indian Consulate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was an Indian girl, Vijaya, who worked in the same section with me at the Indian Consulate. She came from south India, from Kerala, our divine Shivaram's place. She was very nice and kind to me, very fond of me. Some time after I left the Indian Consulate she also left to get married. When she had a child, she wanted me to bless it because, according to her, I was a real swami, a real saint and all that. A few years ago she brought her child to our Centre in New York for blessings. She said, "Look, we were in the same section and you became a saint, a swami." She was very proud that I was an Indian. She was very nice and I blessed the child.</p>
<p>In Toronto, this same Indian lady wanted to come to see me, but she could not come because of family problems. Her husband also likes me very much. In India, whenever you see a swami, a spiritual man, you give him something. So she put fifty dollars in an envelope and wrote, "For the Swami." She gave the money to Shivaram so that she could get inner blessings for her family and for herself. Shivaram gave the envelope to X and X opened it in the plane, saying, "Shivaram told me that this Indian lady had given some money so that she could have your inner blessings, even though she could not come to see you."</p>
<p>What I am saying is, even in those days, when I worked at the Consulate, people saw something in me. Now I have become a Guru, a Master, but even now some people don't recognise anything in me. Such a difference between their spirituality and the spirituality of some of my former colleagues, such as Vijaya. In those days, when I was a junior clerk and she was a junior clerk, she recognised me. Of course, when I was a clerk, Shivaram was also a clerk. Shivaram and I used to talk about Ramakrishna and different spiritual Masters. He saw something in me and he became my disciple. Look at his divinity! My best friend at the Indian Consulate has since become my disciple. Whoever thought, when we were working at the Indian Consulate, that Shivaram would someday become my disciple?</p>
<p>Yesterday an Indian man became a disciple. His brother used to work with us at the Consulate. I don't recollect who he was, but Shivaram says definitely I knew him. He used to work in another section. He used to take photographs. Now his brother, who is also a photographer, has become a disciple in the Toronto Centre!</p>

<p>In Canada when I was flying from Halifax to Quebec, I was carrying my smallest esraj. When I went to sit in my seat, a stewardess asked, "How is it you have brought that in here? Did you pay for it?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, they didn't ask me to pay."</p>
<p>She said, "It is illegal. You have to pay and you can't bring it here."</p>
<p>I said, "They allowed me to come in here and they saw that I was carrying this."</p>
<p>I was sitting on the extreme right. A musician happened to be on the extreme left. He took my side. He got furious, and started abusing the stewardess: "You make your rules every second. All over the world we go and here you won't allow us to carry an instrument." I said, "When I went to Halifax, Air Canada allowed me to bring this with me."</p>
<p>Then the stewardess got frightened or perhaps she was amused. She said, "Please give me the instrument. I will keep it very safe and give it back when we land." She kept her promise. As soon as the plane touched the ground, she brought the instrument back.</p>

<p>When I was staying at the Palace Gardens Hotel, one day around six-thirty or quarter to seven in the morning somebody opened my door. Usually they don't clean so early so I asked, "What is it?"</p>
<p>A maid answered, "Sorry, sorry," and went away.</p>
<p>Then I came out and put the "Don't Disturb" sign on the door and went back into my room. In twenty minutes, the same lady again opened the door. This time I insulted her: "You don't read English? Here is the 'Don't Disturb' sign. You speak English, but you don't read English."</p>
<p>After that, I left my key at the desk and went out for about three hours. When I came back to my room, I realised I had left the key downstairs. I saw the same lady in front of my room, so I said, "I am very sorry, but I left the key downstairs. Would you kindly open my door?"</p>
<p>She said, "How do I know you are staying in that room?"</p>
<p>She would not open the door for me, so I had to go downstairs to get the key. When I came back, she was watching me open the door and laughing at me. For twenty minutes she had bothered me. Then, three hours later, she said she did not recognise me. By not opening the door, she was punishing me for insulting her.</p>

<p>The children in our London Centre are better singers than the children in America. They learned so many songs and performed them extremely well. They also performed excellent plays.</p>
<p>One boy, in a play, recited the Sanskrit for "The Soul cannot be won by the weakling": "<em>Nayam atma balahinena labhyo</em>." Then, instead of singing that song, he sang instead "<em>Tomai dite</em>." I said, "Wonderful!" I called him down from the stage after the play and set tune to the Sanskrit words. I taught the song to him, and then all the children learned it.</p>

<p>I walked out of the store and entered into a bus, leaving behind something I had bought in another shop. O God, the owner of the shop came running to the bus to give me the things that I had bought at another store — even though I hadn't bought anything from his shop.</p>
