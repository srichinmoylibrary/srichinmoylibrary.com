<p><em>(Sunda and Upasunda, two most beautiful Asura brothers, are at their palace.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA: Upasunda, today, I don’t know why or how, I am in a most powerful mood to sing.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Strangely enough, Sunda, I too am deeply inspired to sing.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Wonderful, then let us both sing.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: You sing first, and then I shall sing.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Thank you, Brother.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Heaven is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> I fly beyond its glee<br /> Piercing the Blue.</p>

<p>UPASUNDA <em>(cannot resist the temptation to interrupt Sunda)</em>: Marvellous!</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Earth is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> I fell its ignorance-tree<br /> To plant the True.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Marvellous! Let me continue, Brother.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> Hell is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> My compassion frees its pangs<br /> From the racking screw.</p>

<p>UPASUNDA: Marvellous! Let me complete the song.</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda sings.)</em></p>

<p>What can I do?<br /> My soul is afraid of me.<br /> What can I do?<br /> Body’s eternity<br /> I know is due.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Marvellous, marvellous! No matter who composed the song, it was undoubtedly composed for us to sing. Brother, our love for each other is invincible; our beauty, unfathomable; and our power, immeasurable.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: In us the world can see the supreme incarnations of authority and power. All we need now is the Life of immortality. We have to be immortal like Indra. That’s all.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indra! Don’t use that filthy name! He is our worst enemy. We must dethrone him. We must destroy him. We must prove to the world that he is but a speck of dust, doomed to nothingness.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Alas, he is a cosmic god. Hence he is immortal.</p>
<p>SUNDA: God, god? What kind of god is he? He has no sense of morality. His wild vital does not have even an iota of purity. He is a shameless creature. His life can never love the breath of Truth. It can only love the physical beauty of women.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: You are not an inch from the truth. But we <em>have</em> to become immortal like Indra.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We must start worshipping one of the principal gods in order to get a boon which will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed! Indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I personally don’t care for Shiva.</p>
<p>SUNDAY Neither do I.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: I don’t care for Vishnu, either.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I also don’t care for Vishnu.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: But I love Brahma.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I, too.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us then pray to Brahma day in and day out. Let us practise austerities. Brahma’s transcendental Blessing will grant us Immortality.</p>
<p>SUNDA: I am sure it will.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us leave our palace tomorrow and go to the forest to pray to and meditate on Brahma. Let us sacrifice everything for an immortal life.</p>
<p>SUNDA: A splendid idea, indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: From tomorrow on we must lead the life of true ascetics in the thick of the forest.</p>
<p>SUNDA: We must, without fail, we must.</p>

<p><em>(Inside two forest caves Sunda and Upasunda are chanting, praying and meditating only to please Brahma. Each one has a picture of Brahma in front of him.)</em></p>
<p>SUNDA AND UPASUNDA <em>(chant together three times)</em>:</p>
<p><em>Hiranyagarbhaya vidmahe</em></p>
<p><em>Veda purushaya dhimahi</em></p>
<p><em>Tanno brahma prachodayat</em></p>
<p>We know Him as the Cosmic Creator.</p>
<p>We meditate on Him as the Purusha of the Veda.</p>
<p>May Brahma awaken the Supreme in us.</p>
<p>O Brahma, do appear before us. Do make us immortal like Indra. Everything we have, except Immortality. We don’t want to remain inferior to Indra. O Brahma, O Ocean of Infinite Compassion, it is you alone who can and will fulfil our inmost desire. O Brahma, O Father of Creation, do bless us with your divine Presence supreme.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Indra secretly. Having observed the severe austerities and penances of the two Asura brothers, Indra is terribly frightened. He feels that soon these two brothers will be more powerful than be is, and then they will seize his Kingdom, dethrone him and chase him out of heaven. Indra gets an idea and exits in silence, going back to Indra Puri, the City of Indra.</em></p>
<p><em>Soon he returns to the two Asura brothers with four extremely beautiful dancing girls who, he hopes, will tempt them and ruin them. The dancers offer their superlative performances to the two brothers. In every possible way they try to lower the consciousness of the two aspiring brothers. But all their efforts are in vain. The two genuine seekers are rapt in meditation.</em></p>
<p><em>(Frustrated, disheartened and defeated, Indra leads away the four dancing girls.)</em></p>

<p><em>(The following day. With their eyes slightly open the two brothers are in a very high meditation. They are deeply absorbed in the transcendental consciousness of Brahma.</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Brahma. The two aspirants immediately leave their seats and touch Brahma’s feet for benedictions.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: Your aspiration has pleased me. Your determination has pleased me. What can I do for you?</p>
<p>SUNDA: Lord, we want to equal the cosmic god Indra. Something more, we want to dethrone Indra and become the King of the gods.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We feel that in order to fulfil our heart’s desire we need only one thing, and that thing is an innortal life.</p>
<p>SUNDA AND UPASUNDA: You have just said that you are pleased with our aspiration and determination. If what you say is true, then please, please, please grant us an immortal life so that we can conquer Indra.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: No shadow of a doubt that I am truly pleased with you. But Indra’s supreme position is wellfounded. Ask for another boon.</p>
<p><em>(Sunda and Upasunda are both sunk in despair.)</em></p>
<p>SIUNDA: Then please give us at least the Life of Immortality. We do not want to be killed by anybody. We want our joint strength to be unparalleled in the entire history of the world.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA <em>(seeing Brahma quite hesitant)</em>: All right. At least this much of a favour you can do: if we have to die at all, then we wish to die at the hands of each other.</p>
<p>BRAHMA <em>(blessing them together)</em>: <em>Tathastu</em>. So be it.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Brahma)</em></p>
<p><em>(The two brothers embrace each other and dance with joy.)</em></p>
<p>UPASUNDA: So, we are now immortal!</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, we are!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Brahma’s loftiest vision failed to see into our future.</p>
<p>SUNDA: His third eye didn’t function well today.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA <em>(roaring with laughter)</em>: How can we kill each other? Our sweetest, deepest oneness inseparable shall last through eternity!</p>
<p>SUNDA <em>(with another roaring laugh)</em>: How can we kill each other? Impossible! Creation has never seen and will never see such inseparable oneness.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: That goes without saying. So we are now really immortal!</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, we are. We are immortal forever!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Although Brahma says that that hostile Indra’s position is well established, I simply don’t believe him. Do you?</p>
<p>SUNDA: Not in the least.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We know that our power is invincible.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Indeed, indeed!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We shall be able to conquer Indra. Look at that rascal! Even while we were practicing hard austerities he had to bring down four most beautiful dancers to try to ruin our aspiration and determination.</p>
<p>SUNDA: You know, Brother, that Indra is a rascal of the deepest dye.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us first conquer all the kings on earth, and then with their added power — although we don’t exactly need any more power than we already have — we shall attack Indra, we shall dethrone Indra, and we shall chase Indra away like a cat out of heaven!</p>
<p>SUNDA: How wonderful to hear that!</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Let us go back to our palace. Let us wage war against all the kings immediately. Let us totally destroy their capitals. Delay is not for us. We can easily become the undisputed rulers of the whole world.</p>
<p>SIUNDA: Certainly we can.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: No, nobody on earth will dare to question our supremacy. Once we have conquered the length and breadth of the world with our absolute power, we shall threaten, frighten, attack and dethrone Indra all at once.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Yes, Brother. We must do that. We must and we can. If we don’t, we can’t have everlasting joy.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: We simply <em>must</em> do it.</p>
<p>SUNDA: And we easily can.</p>

<p><em>(Early morning. Brahma’s abode. Brahma’s blessingful meditation on the world is just over.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter four saints.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST SAINT: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world. Sunda and Upasunda are destroying the whole world.</p>
<p>SECOND SAINT: O Lord Brahma, the two <em>Asura</em> brothers have conquered all the peoples of the world. These two <em>Asuras</em> have looted all their wealth.</p>
<p>THIRD SAINT: They are now fully prepared to cross swords with the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>FOURTH SAINT: And soon they will be ready for a ruthless attack on Indra, the King of the cosmic gods.</p>
<p>THE SAINTS <em>(together)</em>: O Lord Brahma, save us, save the world from these two <em>Asuras</em>, or very soon the human race will suffer an eternal end.</p>
<p>BRAHMA <em>(smiling)</em>: My sweet children, I am fully aware of the grim situation. I am fully conscious of the unspeakable misdeeds of the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. Do not burn with impatience. I assure you that their days are numbered.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma starts meditating. In five minutes he creates through his third eye the most beautiful girl of eighteen the universe has ever seen.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL: My Lord, my Creator, my All! My life of unconditional and eternal service I place at your feet. I am sure you have a special plan for my life. My duty, my beauty, my reality and my divinity — all I place at your feet. You are my life’s soul and you are my soul’s goal.</p>
<p><em>(Brahma blesses her. While being blessed she offers her soulful prayer to her creator, the Creator of the universe.)</em></p>
<p>GIRL:</p>

<p>My life began with duty’s pride.<br /> My life shall live with beauty’s light.<br /> My life shall sport with reality’s soul.<br /> My life shall end with Divinity’s Height.</p>

<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, O beauty unparalleled, O beauty’s perfection, descend into the world and do me a service.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: A service! This life of mine is at your express command.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Go and create a terrible dispute between the two <em>Asura</em> brothers, Sunda and Upasunda. Go and tempt them with your beauty’s mightiest power and make them kill each other while fighting for the possession of your matchless beauty.</p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: My Lord, my beauty is yours. My capacity is yours. My victory is yours. I am all yours.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Tilotama)</em></p>
<p>THE FOUR SAINTS <em>(together bowing down to Brahma)</em>: We are sure that Tilottama’s beauty will kill the two <em>Asura</em> brothers. O Lord Brahma, you have saved us, you have saved the world and you have saved the human race. To you we offer the breath of our eternal gratitude.</p>

<p>SUNDA: Like your beauty, your very name is torturing my heart and soul. You make me dream, and I make the world tremble. You are in all my thoughts. I must have you. I must tell you that I love you only, and I love nobody else on earth.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Tilottama, my darling, Sunda is a stranger to truth and I am a stranger to falsehood. I love you only. I am all yours. You are all mine. The moment I saw you my heart came close to breaking with stupendous ecstasy, my darling.</p>
<p>SUNDA: Upasunda, not once but twice, you dare to call her your darling! She is all mine. I am all hers. You rightly deserve most severe punishment from me for your unpardonable audacity.</p>
<p>UPASUNDA: Who punishes whom? You fool, you rogue, you brute!</p>
<p><em>(Upasunda severely strikes Sunda with his naked sword. Sunda immediately crosses his own sword with Upasunda’s. A terrible fight starts between the two. The fight is unbelievably fierce. In a few minutes the two brothers kill each other. Enter Brahma and Indra. Tilottama bows down to Brahma.)</em></p>
<p>TILOTTAMA: O my Creator, O my Source, I was a mere instrument of yours. You have blessed the world with your divine victory supreme. Once again this world of ours shall be flooded with light and delight.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Tilottama, you are my greatest joy and highest pride.</p>
<p>INDRA: Tilottama, you have saved me. You have saved my divine pride. You have saved my Kingdom’s life. My heart’s garland of gratitude to you I offer.</p>
<p><em>(Indra garlands Tilottama.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Shiva, Kumara and Ganapati.)</em></p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, I want to get married.</p>
<p>SHIVA: Why, my son? Why do you want to get married?</p>
<p>KUMARA: I need a woman in my life. I feel that my heart is barren. I need somebody to give me love.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I also want to get married. I also need love from somebody, from a woman. I need it badly, Father.</p>
<p>SHIVA: So both of you want to get married. It is a good idea. But we can’t afford to have two marriages performed at the same time. One of you will have to wait.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, I should get married first, since I made the proposal first.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: No, Father, I should marry first because I am older than he is, and as you know, it is the older child that gets married first. That is our Indian tradition.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, please listen to me. It is I who should get married first. All the time his mind remains in his books. I tell you, if you allow him to get married, he will neglect his wife. He won’t take care of his wife. He will ruin her, and you will feel miserable when you see your daughter-in-law come to you shedding bitter tears. Don’t allow him to get married, Father. It is I who should get married. I belong to this world. I know the ins and outs of this world. I will take care of my wife.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, Kumara knows how to talk, and I know how to act. I tell you, he talks and talks and talks, but when it is a matter of action, he will not be seen anywhere. I shall please my wife. Believe me, Father. Give me the chance. I want to get married first.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Father, Father, it is always said that the youngest son in the family gets the first chance in everything. I am the youngest, Father, so I should get the first chance. I should get married first.</p>
<p>SHIVA: All right. I will tell you what you have to do. Both of you go and travel around the world. Whoever comes back first will be given the opportunity to get married first. I will wait.</p>
<p><em>(Kumara immediately runs away. Ganapati remains.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(to himself)</em>: With this huge belly of mine, how am I going to run like him? Oh God, give me some wisdom. How can I outrun my brother Kumara? He is thin, swift, agile. For me even to walk, to cover a quarter-mile, is an extremely difficult task. I will die if I have to circumnavigate the world. I won’t be able to do it. After I have covered two or three miles, I shall return to God instead of returning home. Let me meditate and see if I can get any ideas.</p>
<p><em>(He meditates. After some time, a brilliant idea enters his mind.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(to himself)</em>: My father! My father is all divinity. This world belongs to him. Naturally, if I go around him, that means I am going around the world. <em>(To his father.)</em> Father, please be seated, please be seated.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva sits down. Singing the glory of his father, Ganapati walks around him seven times.)</em></p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I have won.</p>
<p>SHIVA: How have you won?</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Father, I have won seven times over. You are the world. You are the Lord of the world, and you embody the world. You are the Creator; you are the creation itself. I have gone seven times around you. That means I have gone around the world seven times. Father it is I who should get married first.</p>
<p>SHIVA <em>(deeply pleased)</em>: Go and call your mother.</p>
<p><em>(Ganapati goes out and returns with his mother)</em></p>
<p>SHIVA <em>(to his wife)</em>: Your son Ganapati has won a race against Kumara. This morning both brothers insisted on getting married. When I agreed, each of them wanted to be the first to marry. I said the first one to travel around the world would be the first to get married. Ganapati asked me to sit down. I sat down, and he walked around me seven times. Naturally he is the winner.</p>
<p>DURGA: I am truly happy that we have a son who is wise. The other son is strong and powerful, but he does not have wisdom, alas. He will run and run and run. God knows when he will come back. I feel sorry for that boy, and I am proud of this boy. Let us marry this son. It is my wish that this son will marry two girls at the same time.</p>
<p>GANAPATI: Two? Two, Mother?</p>
<p>DURGA: Yes, my son, two. I need two girls to help me. And who knows, when Kumara comes back, he may be disappointed, seeing that you have married first, and he may not marry at all. So the best thing is for us to get two girls for you.</p>
<p>GANAPATI <em>(very happy)</em>: Oh, Mother! They will help you, so you won’t have to work anymore. And I will be so happy and proud. Everybody else has one wife, but I will have two wives!</p>
<p><em>(Shiva smiles and blesses his son.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Several days later, before Kumara returns home, he meets his enemy, Narada.)</em></p>
<p>NARADA: O Kumara, everything is finished.</p>
<p>KUMARA: What is finished?</p>
<p>NARADA: Finished. Your brother, Ganapati, has gotten married.</p>
<p>KUMARA: How? When? How did he reach our father before me? Has he gone around the world?</p>
<p>NARADA: Well, I do not know about that. But I can tell you that I have just come from your house, where I saw that he has two most beautiful girls as his wives.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two? He has married two?</p>
<p>NARADA: Yes. Your parents are so pleased with him, so proud of him. Instead of one, they have brought him two beautiful, most beautiful girls. I don’t know. When you get married, I doubt that you will get as beautiful a girl for yourself.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Two wives? Two beautiful wives? I can’t believe you!</p>
<p>NARADA: If you do not believe me, you can go and see for yourself. You are very near your house.</p>
<p>KUMARA: Unbelievable! Unthinkable! My parents, my own parents have deceived me! Let me go and see.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Scene III</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene III" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(Kumara, running, enters his home and sees two most beautiful girls with Ganapati and his parents. He is furious.)</em></p>
<p>KUMARA: <em>(to his parents)</em>: You have deceived me! You didn’t even wait for me. How did he come back before me?</p>
<p>SHIVA: My son, he knew that I am divine. He knew that I am the Creator and I am the creation. He knew that I am God and I am the world. So he went around me not once, but seven times. And you, my son, you have come only now, so late.</p>
<p>KUMARA: No! It is all deception, all deception! I can’t tolerate this. I am going into the forest. I will never, never marry in this life. I don’t need women, Who cares for a woman’s beauty? Beauty is, after all, only skin deep. I shall care only for the soul’s beauty, the eternal beauty. Women are bondage. I don’t need bondage. My brother now has double bondage: two women in his life. He was a fool to get married. Now he is stuck, but I can run towards my goal the fastest because I am free from bondage.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva blesses his son.)</em></p>
<p>SHIVA: Kumara, in some cases, marriage does help; in other cases, it is an obstruction. For you, marriage would be an obstruction, a curse. You do not need a wife. You need only God. To realise Him, to fulfil Him, is your sole aim. Marriage would not allow you to think of God, to meditate on God, And I want you to realise God as soon as possible without having this added burden on your shoulders. So to remain unmarried is, for you, a real blessing. But in Ganapati’s case, marriage is a blessing, a real boon. With his marriage, he will be able to fulfil himself and God. The added strength it gives him will allow him to run the fastest in his own way. We want satisfaction, real satisfaction, from both of you. Your unmarried life the world will adore. In his case, the world will see that with a wife one can also go to God. God is both man and woman. How can you ignore the part that is woman? Ganapati will take the other half, woman, to God. Both husband and wife can go to God simultaneously to fulfil Him, which is absolutely necessary. God wants you to remain unmarried and He wants your brother to lead a married life. Your brother is fulfilling God’s wish, as you will be from now on. So you please God in one way, and he pleases God in another way. Both of you are pleasing God in His own way.</p>
<p><em>(Shiva sings.)</em></p>

<p>What is marriage?<br /> The smile of love<br /> That allows two souls<br /> To soar above.</p>
<p>What is marriage?<br /> The curse of Night.<br /> A tug-of-war.<br /> No escape to Light.</p>
<p><em>(To Ganapati.)</em></p>
<p>What is marriage?<br /> God’s fulfilment true.<br /> In Silence and Power<br /> His Vision’s due.</p>
