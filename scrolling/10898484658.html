<p>Sanctity is the messenger, the harbinger of divinity. Sanctity is the message of God's inner Reality; sanctity is the fulfilling instrument of Reality. With sanctity God started His cosmic Game. In sanctity He feels His veritable Pride. For sanctity He is more than willing to give His All. And to sanctity He offers gladly His Reality and His Essence.</p>

<p>Self-confidence comes into existence when we feel that there is some higher force that is constantly looking after us and guiding us. If we do not have that kind of feeling or belief, then we can have no abiding self-confidence. We have to cultivate faith in our Inner Pilot. Right now He is unknowable. If we pray and meditate, He becomes knowable. And if we continue along the spiritual path, He eventually becomes totally known.</p>
<p>Self-confidence comes into existence when we offer our very existence to the feet of a higher force. If that higher force is right now only imaginary, no harm. If we have faith and if we surrender our existence to this higher force, then self-confidence is automatically achieved in our life of aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Selflessness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Selflessness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Man is infinite, man is eternal, man is immortal. But how can we really feel that we are infinite, eternal, immortal? We can do so only on the strength of our selflessness and sacrifice to the Supreme in ourselves and in humanity.</p>
<p>Selflessness must be properly understood. If one feels that it is by virtue of sacrifice that he is becoming totally one with the rest of the world, then that is not selflessness. To be really selfless, one must already feel and realise his oneness with the entire creation. Otherwise, one will always be under the impression that he is doing something grand and great by offering himself and serving someone. But when oneness has already been achieved, felt and realised, at that time selflessness really acquires its meaning. The seeker knows that he is one with the universe, and with this oneness he is now playing his own part. At that time we can't call selflessness something that we are offering. No, it is something that we are growing into. Each selfless act leads us to something greater, and that something greater also is ours.</p>
<p>Real selflessness we see only in God. He did not want to separate Himself from His creation. Creator and creation went together, go together and will forever go together. So it is God's supreme selflessness that we see in His creation. If we can have that selflessness, that reality and vision in our human life, this will be the full manifestation of selflessness in reality. Let us try to realise our oneness with the rest of the world and with God's creation. Then our Goal will be right in front of us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sight</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sight" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When we see something outwardly either we are satisfied or dissatisfied. But if the inner sight or inner vision dawns when there is not sufficient wisdom, then problems arise. When inner vision dawns we become one with the reality that we see. Then, if we have a frightening experience, we may suffer for years.</p>
<p>In our spiritual life, when we identify ourselves with something, we become part and parcel of its consciousness. Suppose we are using our outer sight, and we see a chicken being killed in front of us. We will feel that it is something natural and normal. Our outer sight is not enabling us to identify ourselves with the consciousness or with the life-breath of the chicken. But if we have inner sight, we may see that we ourselves were a chicken many incarnations ago. Then what will happen? We will immediately identify ourselves with the chicken and then we will feel that we are being killed. We will be horror-struck. And the person who has killed the chicken will be an object of contempt forever.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life we should pray for God to grant us inner sight only when He feels that it is necessary for us. Many of you here think, "Oh, if only I had my third eye open." But your third eye may immediately tell you that in your last incarnation you were the worst possible scoundrel, and then you will feel miserable. Inner sight has to be opened only when there is inner maturity, when neither the past nor the future can disturb us.</p>

<p>When you meditate and go deep within, you enter into the realm of silence, real silence. In this silence Reality is growing. But when you are in deep silence, real silence, spiritual silence, there you will also see truth is growing, love is growing, beauty is growing; everything is growing and flowing. In real silence, Reality is constantly growing in different forms and shapes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Simplicity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Simplicity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Simplicity is the most valuable treasure in God's creation, in God's realisation and in God's manifestation. God is always simple, but we think of Him as complex. With our fertile mind, it is we who make God complex and then create problems for ourselves. The simpler we can become, the sooner we shall reach our destination. A life of simplicity is a life of constant progress. It is in simplicity that we can make the fastest progress, progress which is everlasting.</p>
<p>Simplicity is our natural or conscious awareness of reality. The moment we realise our highest transcendental Reality, we become simple. In the spiritual life, the higher we go, the deeper we go; the farther we go, the more we will see that Reality is only the song of simplicity and nothing else. The entire cosmic Game is extremely simple, but we look at it from a different angle in an obscure way. That is why we feel it is very complex, but everything is simple.</p>

<p>Sincerity God gives us only when we feel that we shall forever remain God's divine children. Everybody is sincere according to his own sense of sincerity, but a seeker has to be sincere at every moment in what he says and what he does in order to grow into the very image of God. His sincerity has to be constant and continuous. His life he must not separate from sincerity even for a second.</p>

<p>In the spiritual life when we surrender, we consciously surrender our lower life to our higher life. We surrender our lower life because we feel that our higher part is truly our very own. True surrender means the conscious acceptance by the finite of Infinity's will and vision.</p>
<p>We have to surrender only to the One in whom we have perfect faith. We shall not surrender to others' thought or will or command or demand, even if they are superior to us in terms of age or position. No! We shall surrender only to Him in whom we have perfect faith, to the Reality, to the Inner Pilot where we will get our true fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Truth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Truth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is a great difference between human or moral truth and divine or spiritual truth. When we come out of the animal kingdom we use the moral truth. It is absolutely necessary at this stage of our development. But when we enter into the spiritual life, moral truth is transcended by spiritual truth. Once an individual has attained to moral truth, then he will only have to wait for the inner command, which is truth's real self-expression. At that time, he cannot be bound by moral truth.</p>
<p>If we tell someone a moral truth, then we may create tremendous disorder in the cosmos. Suppose somebody who is being chased by another person with a knife has come to you for protection. You give him shelter because you know that the person who was chasing him wants to kill him. Out of your sincerity or love for truth, if you say that you know where the person is, then the man with the knife will grab him and kill him. Then your moral truth will be responsible for his death. If you say that you know where the person is but will not tell, then there will be a fight. But if you say, "I don't know," then you are exercising your divine wisdom and saving the life of the person. The life of one person is infinitely more valuable than your one utterance of truth. The truth will try to save a life; it wants to save, protect and illumine human life.</p>
<p>When we enter into the spiritual life, we must always listen to what our inner being says. Otherwise, in the name of sincerity we may act most stupidly. Very often we become stupid when we try to become overly sincere. Sincerity is very good, but we have to know that we have to go beyond the so-called moral truth if the inner being commands us. Otherwise, if we stick to our moral principle, then the higher truth will not be able to manifest.</p>
<p>In the field of manifestation we have to be very, very careful with truth. Truth has to be spoken, but we have to know what is beyond the earthly truth. God's Will is infinitely more important than the so-called utterance of truth. If we give the same importance to earthly mundane truth that we give to the eternal Truth, then we will be making a Himalayan mistake.</p>
<p>If we speak truth just for the sake of truth, then we create more disharmony, more frustration and more misery in life. Beyond the so-called earthly truth we have to see God's Vision, the ultimate Vision and ultimate Truth.</p>
<p>There is temporary truth and eternal Truth. The eternal Truth is that God is our Father and Mother and that we are God's children. But here in the field of manifestation, we live in temporary truth. Sometimes we feel that we are God's children and sometimes we feel that we have nothing to do with God. When we feel that we have nothing to do with God, we may act like animals, as if we have no past and no future, as if this is our first and last human incarnation.</p>
<p>In the case of a patient who is dying, the doctor may say, "No, you will live, you will live." Although the doctor knows that in a few minutes' time the patient will die, still he gives the patient encouragement and strength. According to earthly truth, the doctor is telling a lie. But although the doctor may not be conscious of it, his soul is giving the patient an opportunity to fight against death. The patient will say, "I have a chance to live. Let me pray and think of God." Then, God's Grace may descend and he may actually live for another few months or years. If he continues to pray and meditate during this period, then the doctor's lie will have proven to be a real boon.</p>
<p>Let us take another example. Suppose a young boy comes to you and asks for a dollar. You give him the money and he goes to a bar and drinks wine. Now, who is responsible for this? You have played your role, but you did not see this vision of the future. Just because the boy sincerely asked you for a gift, you gave it to him. His sincerity, his truth, you approved or supported with your ignorance. His sincerity is represented here as truth, but you have to go beyond this truth and see what is going to happen ultimately.</p>
<p>So in this world, temporary truth has to be surrendered to the ultimate Truth. The Truth that has more power and more meaning has to be brought down into the temporary truth. Temporary truth has its value; earthly truth has its value. But always we have to go and knock at the Truth which is beyond, which is constantly receiving God's Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Unity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Unity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God in His highest aspect is static and dynamic. In His oneness with the dynamic and static consciousness, we see God's true unity. God's journey started with unity, but when He entered into the world, His unity became multiplicity. In the highest, in the world of Silence, it is all unity. Here on earth, in the world of sound, it is all multiplicity. But unity and multiplicity go together.</p>
<p>The creation started with Existence Consciousness, Bliss — <em>Satchidananda</em>. This triple consciousness, where God is all Unity, is responsible for the entire creation. Below this triple consciousness is what is called the Supermind. The power of the Supermind is not a vital power like the power of Nietzsche's Superman. The Supermind is all luminosity. From here the creation actually started. The Supermind is the highest rung of the ladder of evolution. Here also there is unity. Truth can be seen in the form of unity; Power can be seen in the form of unity; everything can be seen in the garb of unity. The next descending rung is the overmind. Here multiplicity actually starts. In the overmind, unity is scattered.</p>
<p>Then we come down to the intuitive plane or intuition proper. Here we see the unity of Truth, the unity of Light, the unity of Power in a limited measure. Although we use our third eye in the intuitive plane and see everything as a whole, we do not see unity here the way we see unity in Existence-Consciousness-Bliss or in the Supermind.</p>
<p>Then below intuition, below the intuitive plane, is the mind. This mind can be called the calm or quiet mind, the vacant mind, because everything is calm, quiet and vacant. But here real unity is lacking. Truth is there, divinity is there, joy is there, beauty is there; but real unity is missing. Multiplicity reigns.</p>
<p>Then when we come to the vital, there is no unity at all. The vital quite often has aggressive forms of multiplicity.</p>
<p>In the physical we cannot even think of unity. But a day will come when we will have to bring down the highest unity consciously into the gross physical.</p>
<p>There is much truth in the maxim "United we stand, divided we fall." The soul, heart, body, mind and vital must go together. Otherwise, the soul by itself can do nothing, the mind by itself can do nothing, the body by itself can do nothing. All these must go together in order for us to realise God fully and integrally. It is only in their united effort that God the Creator and God the Creation can be realised, revealed and manifested.</p>

<p>The physical will lasts for a fleeting second. The vital will very often plays the role of destruction. The mental will sooner or later finds satisfaction in contradicting itself. The psychic will, the soul's will, finds not only satisfaction but real fulfilment in identifying itself with God's Will. The psychic will gets its illumination and its message of perfection through unconditional surrender to the universal Will.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Wisdom</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Wisdom" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What do we mean by the word 'wisdom'? Usually we mean something superior to knowledge, something deeper. In the spiritual world, the word 'wisdom' is not used in that way. Here wisdom means Light, illumining Light, transforming Light. That which illumines our unlit consciousness is wisdom. That which transforms the finite consciousness into the infinite Consciousness is called wisdom.</p>
