<p>I am so proud, so proud of my disciples who are working at the United Nations. They carry my vibration, my consciousness, my light. When the disciples go to meditate at the UN in my absence, it gives me such joy. I take such pride in these Meditation Group members. They go to meditate in my absence; they think of me, they meditate on me. At that time they get my blessings, they get my light, they get my gratitude and gratitude and gratitude. Inwardly they get my blessings. They love me and they are carrying my mission at the United Nations in my physical absence. They have such love for me, and they listen to my request. They do it so faithfully.</p>
<p>All those who pray and meditate at the United Nations in my physical absence rightly deserve my appreciation and admiration, plus gratitude and gratitude and gratitude.</p>

<p>Discipline! Perhaps I was born with discipline. In India I lived a disciplined life. Here in America also, if I did not believe in discipline and regularity, I could not accomplish so many things every day. Punctuality I miss sometimes, but regularity really saves me.</p>
<p>Regularity is of paramount importance for all my spiritual children. Again, punctuality is infinitely better; but if you fail in punctuality, at least stick to regularity. We need regularity, regularity, regularity. There is no other way to accomplish something great and good.</p>

<p>I went to our San Diego Centre. And what did I do there? As soon as I saw some of the paintings which I did in 1976, I cried and cried with joy. I took pictures of four or five framed originals. I could not believe I was the artist! They were so beautiful, so beautiful!</p>
<p>There were six or seven paintings that made me cry and cry. My soul, my heart and my entire existence were absolutely overwhelmed. You cannot imagine what I felt when I was looking at those paintings.</p>
<p>Our San Francisco Centre also has quite a few originals. My boss at the Indian Consulate, Mr. Mehrotra, was transferred to San Francisco. He came to our Jharna-Kala gallery there, and he was so deeply moved. Then I invited him and his wife to eat at our restaurant. They sat with me, and I started painting in front of them. I gave them the painting that I had done right in front of them. It was a really beautiful painting! Mr. Mehrotra was very happy, and I was also very happy.</p>

<p>If our mountain-climbers do not have a guide, they must not climb! Recently, three climbers I almost lost. Three divine soldiers, three of my spiritual children I would have lost, had God’s Grace not saved them. Believe me, believe me, it was not only a most serious accident; it was a life-taking experience</p>
<p>Always take a guide, take a guide, take a guide. Today you three are alive. Our Beloved Supreme, out of His Infinite Bounty, has saved you. My soul is always in you, in you, in you — in all those who have accepted me sincerely and soulfully. Today you are alive. In the future, no matter where you go, you need a guide, you need a guide. It was a life-threatening experience that you gave to yourselves. Please, please, please take my words seriously.</p>
<p>Today I am so happy, so happy to have you back in my presence. Never, never, never climb without a guide.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Poems on the wall</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Poems on the wall" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I am making a confession. Usually I do not believe in confession; I believe in forgiveness and illumination. Seven or eight, or perhaps even ten poems I have “copied.” Copied from where? Copied from the wall!</p>
<p>It was around eleven or twelve o’clock at night in Pondicherry. My brother Chitta and I stayed in the same room. We had turned off the light. He was in his bed and I was in mine. He was fast asleep. All of a sudden I saw that the room was illuminated. There was a long wall on my right side. Right near my feet was the entrance. What did I see? A full poem, in Bengali words! The poem was written on the wall, but there was no name. It was so beautiful! Then I meditated and meditated. I knew that those words had come from another world. Some poets, I have heard, have had the same experience.</p>
<p>I copied several poems and I claimed them. Those poems came from the poetry-world. From this world, poems or words can come into your heart or into your ear. One of the poems I still vividly remember: <em>Srashta amar jagater jyoti</em>. That poem came from the poetry-world.</p>
<p>I am sure that many, many poets have had the same kind of experience. Many, many poems, line by line, may enter into your heart, into your mind, and then you just copy them. In my case, the poems were written on the wall at night.</p>

<p>I went to the hospital to visit my Chinese doctor. An Indian lady doctor was in the room. I said to her, “He is alive. Can you try again to revive him?”</p>
<p>She did not want to do anything. Then a disciple who was with me contacted another doctor who was the disciple’s friend, and he said something to the lady doctor. Finally she condescended to look at the patient. She did not take even a second. She said, “Oh, he is dead.”</p>
<p>I went home, knowing perfectly well that my Chinese doctor was still alive. If there had been a sympathetic doctor available who really trusted me, he or she would have examined the patient and tried to do something. But this lady did not care. What a sad experience that doctor gave me! This was the worst possible experience.</p>
<p>Again, I also had the best possible experience. Many, many years ago my dearest Brother-Friend Alexandr Razvin [fn:2] was in the hospital, and I went to see him. He said to me, “Sri Chinmoy, do not worry! I have an excellent doctor, an excellent doctor! She will cure me.”</p>
<p>This doctor, who was also an Indian lady, immediately said, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Swamiji is the one to cure you, Swamiji is the one to cure you!”</p>
<p>Then the doctor asked me if I would be staying there for a few minutes. I said, “Definitely I will stay.” What did she do? She went downstairs and brought her husband. The husband fell at my feet. The doctor said, “He has been longing, longing to meet with you.” She was so happy! That was an excellent experience.</p>
<p>That Indian lady doctor gave me the experience of Heaven. How devotedly she spoke to me! She went downstairs and brought her husband because she knew that her husband had tremendous admiration for me.</p>
<p>Heaven and hell go together. They are side by side.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Never retire!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Never retire!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I beg all the disciples, never retire, never retire! Retirement stands against enlightenment. If you retire, then your life-energy, your mental strength, everything disappears, unless you can be very, very active. Retirement is just the opposite of enlightenment. Never retire! Work as long as you can! By your own choice I never, never advise you to retire. But if the organisation has a fixed retirement age, you are helpless.</p>
<p>Those of you who are serving the United Nations, I will be very, very happy if you can continue as long as possible. True, the United Nations is not perfect. Is there any place that is perfect? Is anybody perfect in God’s Creation? In comparison to other places, the United Nations, as it is, is Heaven. Some individual bosses or colleagues may be undivine, but the soul and heart of the United Nations will always remain the goal of goals for humanity. Life is complicated; the mind is complicated. To transform the mind and the life of the United Nations, spirituality is needed.</p>
<p>Again, I am so grateful to my spiritual children who come to meditate at the UN in my absence. Those who come to meditate when I am not present deserve my boundless love, affection and admiration. Those who come to pray and meditate for fifteen minutes in my physical absence I can say are my true, true disciples. They value my inner existence; they value my God-realisation; they value me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Those who stay to the very end</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Those who stay to the very end" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At our Aspiration-Ground, some disciples are very good. They stay to the very, very end of our functions. And again, to my greatest joy, there are some disciples who would be gladly willing to stay indefinitely. If I were to stay there for three hours or four hours, they would stay.</p>
<p>Some may say that those are fanatic disciples, or that they have nothing else to do. I do not see eye-to-eye with those critics. Only because of their love for me, because of their oneness with my soul, my heart and my life, those disciples are more than ready, more than willing, more than eager to stay at the Aspiration-Ground as long as I stay. Like that there are some super-super-disciples.</p>
<p>Those who stay with me, even when I cut jokes, know the meaning of <em>satsang</em>: meeting with spiritual people. Sri Aurobindo’s story, “The Ideal of Forgiveness,” perhaps you have read. Vishwamitra came to kill the sage Vashishtha. He was in Vashishtha’s presence for only a few minutes. When he saw Vashishtha’s forgiveness-capacity, he bowed and touched Vashishtha’s feet.</p>
<p>Then, when Vishwamitra wanted to be initiated, Vashishtha sent him to another place. There Ananta Dev told him that he had to hold the world. Then only Ananta Dev would initiate him. Alas, the whole world was collapsing on Vishwamitra.</p>
<p>Vishwamitra was praying to Ananta Dev to save him. Ananta Dev said to Vishwamitra, “Just tell me, were you ever in the company of a spiritual person?”</p>
<p>Vishwamitra said, “Oh, I was with Vashishtha for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Then think of him, and think of the incident.”</p>
<p>Vishwamitra thought of Vashishtha, and then the whole world became calm and quiet.</p>
<p>In India, seekers give utmost importance to the company of religious and spiritual people. I am your spiritual Master. Perhaps I am one step ahead of the ordinary spiritual people.</p>
<p>There are many, many seekers and disciples who do not feel that familiarity breeds contempt. That idea is not in their philosophy. They feel that, the longer they can stay with the Master, the more they receive. Even when he cuts jokes, when he is absolutely one with them and enjoying hilarious laughter, they feel that their souls are being fed, their hearts are being fed, their lives are being fed. I do have quite a few disciples like that. Again, there are those seekers who value their comfort more than their Master’s company. One hour of meditation is enough for them.</p>
<p>Everything is being recorded, recorded in the inner history: who cares for me, who loves me. Some disciples stay on the spiritual path for other reasons. But those who stay out of their heart’s love and their soul’s love are my true disciples.</p>
<p>Needless to say, here I end. I cannot say anything more.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Victory is meant for those who can tolerate</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Victory is meant for those who can tolerate" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>You have written to me about the difficulties you are having with your boss. You have to tolerate, tolerate, tolerate this boss. In a few months the boss will retire and disappear, so you do not have to worry.</p>
<p>Each time the boss treats you unjustly, just think of my affection, love, gratitude and pride. Immediately imagine me. Others also have gone through this experience. They survived, and you also can survive. You will survive. Survive, survive, survive!</p>
<p>Victory is meant for those who can tolerate. In my life, have I not been the example? Those who stand against spirituality may be impossible human beings, but there is a law of karma. Right now we may not see their karma, but from Heaven we are bound to see that they will reap the results of their actions, either in this incarnation or in their future incarnations. If we surrender to God’s Will, then God will definitely give us the capacity to see the experiences that God is going to give them.</p>
<p>Time is a great factor — time, time. Unfortunately, we have chosen time in our own way. Again, God has chosen time in His own Way. When it is a matter of our human time, everybody can escape. But when God’s Hour strikes, nobody can escape, nobody can escape.</p>
<p>Tolerance, tolerance, tolerance!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">California was spiritually awakened</h2><span property="dc:title" content="California was spiritually awakened" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>According to me, California is one of the very ancient spiritual states. Some of my Indian predecessors took shelter in California or gave light to California, so California, like New York, is a state that can take pride in Indian spirituality. California was spiritually awakened long before many other states. Long before I came, California was spiritually awakened.</p>
<p>One spiritual Master said that San Diego is the mind of spirituality. His Guru from the Himalayas told him that San Diego is the spirituality-mind. He came here because his Guru from the Himalayas asked him to discover the spirituality-mind and spread his Guru’s light.</p>
<p>My California children, I have come here to love you and inspire you, inspire you, inspire you. I have come to inspire you, my California disciples, with the hope that you will inspire your beautiful, powerful state. I will inspire you, and you also can inspire others. With that hope I come — not only to California, but to other states and other countries, only to inspire the disciples. I come to see my disciples in their respective Centres with the hope that they will inspire others around them.</p>
<p>We all need inspiration, inspiration, inspiration! Without inspiration, without enthusiasm, we shall never be able to become good seekers. If we really want to be good seekers and God-lovers, then inspiration and aspiration we must develop to our ultimate capacity.</p>

<p>I have faith in Joy Days! Please see how often you can have Joy Days. When you have Joy Days, use your fertile brain to discover how you can spread your Guru’s light! During Joy Days you are happy and relaxed. When you are relaxed, you can think of spreading light, light, your Guru’s light. I will be very happy if you can have more Joy Days.</p>
<p>When there are Joy Days in Europe, sometimes 700 or 800 disciples take part. My joy at that time knows no bounds! I believe three times a year there are over 700 disciples present. Sometimes I call and speak to them. The other day, I think it was in Ukraine, there were more than 800 disciples present for Joy Days. I did speak to them.</p>
<p>In my physical absence, how many people take part three times a year! They all meet together for two full days.</p>
<p>Joy Days, Joy Days! Nothing gives me as much joy as Joy Days. When my children meet together to pray, meditate and play, they feed their souls, they feed their hearts, they feed their physical existence. What else do they need?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Those who value me</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Those who value me" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I shall always say that those who value me, I also value. Not only that, but those who value me inwardly, outwardly, lovingly and self-givingly are the ones who are my true, true, true disciples. A million times I can say “true.” It is our mutual appreciation, mutual acceptance. There are many, many, many disciples, here, there and everywhere, who do value me. They offer their hearts to our spirituality. The more we can develop our inner hunger, the more we will be able to receive from Above.</p>
<p>Allow me to say one thing more. Many, many disciples came recently to Italy and France when I went there. They also come regularly to New York, twice a year, in April and August. Some of them come even four or five times a year. As soon as they have the necessary means, they come. And the same people came to see me in Italy and France. If this is not their spiritual hunger, what else is it?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The proper meaning of my writings</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The proper meaning of my writings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I wish to add something to my ancient talk about God the Doer that a disciple has just read out.</p>
<p>When we say, “I am not the doer; God is the Doer,” this statement has to come to us from our own inner, higher experiences. When someone says that he is not the doer, but God Himself is the Doer, this is appropriate only if that individual is a most sincere seeker, if he is to some extent spiritually developed. An undivine person may kill someone and say, “I am not the doer; God is the Doer.” Naturally, jail will invite that person.</p>
<p>When we say we are not the doer, this pronouncement has to come from the depths of our devotion-heart. We shall do something significant, most significant in our lives for God. Then we shall have to use our humility and devotion and say, with utmost sincerity, “I did not do it; God did it in and through me.” Then God will be very proud of us and God will increase our inner capacities to fulfil Him and please Him in more significant ways.</p>
<p>Alas, quite often we are apt to do wrong things, undivine things, absurd things, and then say, “I have not done it; God has done it in and through me.” That is the height of our stupidity.</p>
<p>One disciple who has been with us for at least fifteen years wrote to me that, for the last two years, wrong forces have been disturbing his mind and heart. At times he surrendered to those hostile forces. Now that disciple is in serious confusion. The justification came to the fore in his mind: “Guru has written in his books that we are not the doers; God is the Doer.”</p>
<p>Then again, when that particular disciple is in the heart, he is tortured by his conscience. Now he wants to know from me which is correct: the mind’s justification that God is the Doer and the disciple is not the doer, or the heart’s conscience. The disciple gets a little comfort on the strength of my repeated assurance that God is the Doer. Then again, on rare occasions the disciple takes the responsibility on his own shoulders, and he feels that he himself is to be blamed.</p>
<p>If you do the wrong thing, you must not blame poor God. And when you do the right thing, you must not say, “I am the doer,” “I did it,” “It is all ‘I and me, I and me.’ ” If you stay on our path, this much conscience and this much inner divinity you have to develop.</p>
<p>Let us not fool ourselves. Let us say, “If I cannot do the right thing, at least let me not do the wrong thing.” Yes, it is very, very difficult to do the right thing. But again, there is a middle course. If you cannot do the right thing, do not do the bad thing. Remain at least inactive.</p>
<p>I always say if you are being attacked by wrong forces, just count how many wrong forces are torturing you today. Write down the number! Tomorrow again count them. And in the meantime pray to God, “Please take away from me all these wrong forces.” If you pray to the Supreme, who is our God, and if your sincerity is involved, you are bound to see that the number of wrong forces has decreased. Tomorrow again, pray to the Supreme with utmost sincerity. You are bound to see that the day after tomorrow, and every day after that, the wrong forces that have been attacking you will decrease considerably. But they will decrease considerably only if there is an inner cry, if there are sincere tears in your heart.</p>
<p>If we want to save ourselves, if we want to please God, there is a way. God does not expect from us overnight perfection — never, never! That He never expects. He expects only progress, a little progress. When we make a little progress, it gives God immense Satisfaction. Even tinier than the tiniest progress if we can make in our spiritual life, God becomes extremely, extremely, extremely proud of us. But if we enjoy our stupidity, if we continue doing the wrong thing, if we are indulgent to the wrong forces and try to convince ourselves that God is the Doer, this self-deception is quite deplorable.</p>
<p>Dear ones, try to do always the right thing. If you are doing or you have been doing a few undivine things, count them. You can easily count them. You are not doing hundreds of wrong things in a day. You may do three or four wrong things a day, or even five, let us say. Then pray to God with utmost, utmost sincerity to take away those wrong forces that are disturbing you. I assure you, God is all Compassion, all Affection, all Sweetness and Fondness for us. If we pray with tears in our heart to God, definitely, definitely, definitely tomorrow we will see that a few wrong forces have already left us, or they are not allowed to attack us any more.</p>
<p>In one single day we cannot become perfect. But in one single day we can get rid of many uncomely, undivine, unspiritual forces from our system, from our spiritual life. Many, many wrong forces we can cast aside.</p>
<p>Please be careful when you quote from my writings. When I say something, try to dive deep within and get the proper meaning of my writings. If you use your own clever mind and that clever mind gives you justification for wrong actions, that justification will be a painful experience.</p>

<p>Each and every disciple of mine, if you want to prove that you are a good disciple, a real disciple of Sri Chinmoy, develop only one thing, not two things: eagerness, eagerness, eagerness. You do not need two things to please me. Only one thing is needed: eagerness, eagerness, eagerness.</p>
<p>Where there is eagerness, all the obstacles on the way we can surmount. And if there is no eagerness, that is worse than death itself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My subtle body visits my disciples</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My subtle body visits my disciples" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My subtle body has visited my disciples all over the world thousands and thousands of times over the years. You do not have to die to use your subtle body! You can easily use your subtle body when you are in the land of the living, at any time, at any given hour. The subtle body can be brought out of the physical body and, believe it or not, it can visit any part of the world. I have done it thousands and thousands of times, and many juicy stories I can tell. Either to your great astonishment or to your great disbelief, even while my doctors are massaging me, I can bring the subtle body to the fore and send it anywhere. I just send it like a messenger boy.</p>
<p>Avatars can do this; spiritual figures can do it. Just because we ourselves cannot do something, we must not say that it cannot be done, it cannot be done. If we stick to that theory, it will be the height of our stupidity. Just because with my physical eyes I cannot see South Africa, let us say, I cannot say that South Africa does not exist. A poor villager somewhere who cannot afford to have a telephone will be apt to say that South Africa or some other country does not exist. For that villager, the world is only his immediate vicinity, the few villages that are around him. Those places are real for him; about the rest of the world he will immediately say, “No, no, no, it does not exist.”</p>
<p>Many, many things, countless things we cannot do. Again, there are some exceptional human beings. They are human, but God has blessed them with spiritual power, occult power and intuitive faculties. They can do many things.</p>
<p>My dear children, just because you cannot do something, do not be inclined to disbelieve it. If you say, “Seeing is believing,” I wish to say that there are many, many things we have not seen but we believe. The mother says, “This is your father,” and the child believes her. Great scientists have ways to see and count the stars. Just because we do not have their capacities and facilities, we may not appreciate their discoveries. In every aspect of life there are so many things to believe or not to believe. But if we believe, then we get tremendous satisfaction. When it is a matter of the subtle body, please take it in that way.</p>
<p>Even right here there are quite a few disciples whom I have visited in my subtle body over the years. Some of you perhaps were at that time fast asleep. Again, some of you will not believe it, because on that particular day you were perhaps not in a high consciousness. When God wants to show us His Compassion, He does not have to wait for our highest consciousness. Yes, He can come to us when we are in our highest consciousness. Again, the same God can come to us when we are in our absolutely lowest consciousness.</p>
<p>We cannot bind God. We cannot say, “Oh, if we are pure, then only God will come. If we are not pure, why should God come?” That is a long-standing theory. But I wish to say that if God wants to visit us, He does not care for our spiritual standard or inner standard. He just does it, and He gets Joy. He has His own Way of accomplishing something, and everything is at His Command.</p>
<p>Out of His infinite Compassion, God wants to give little, little candies to the spiritual Masters so that they can share these candies with the seekers. Sometimes a spiritual Master shares the candies while a seeker is fast asleep. Then the seeker gets up early in the morning and says, “My God, how is it that today’s world is so beautiful, so pure, so refreshing? What has happened?” Why is it so? Because early in the morning God came and gave the seeker His Affection and Compassion, like a piece of candy. Then the seeker’s world became totally different — full of joy, full of love, full of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Either God Himself comes to us, or He sends the Master’s soul. In so many ways God can give us joy, in top secrecy.</p>
