<p>Yesterday, when I was running a race in Australia, two runners went ahead of me. As they were passing me, one of them told the other, "This guy is everything! Turn around!" Both of them turned and looked at me.</p>
<p>Then, right after the race, somebody else came up to me and started asking me about food. He said, "Why do you not allow people to eat meat and fish?" I simply smiled at him.</p>
<p>This second experience happened immediately after the race, when I was so tired and exhausted. That is why I was not in the mood to answer the question.</p>

<p>When I was out walking, just across from Agni Press, about five young boys around twelve or thirteen years old came right up in front of me and stood there with folded hands.</p>
<p>One of them said to me, "O great man, I bow to thee!"</p>
<p>I said to the boy, "I bless you."</p>
<p>The boy was so startled: "What! You bless me!"</p>
<p>I said, "If you are bowing to me, then why should I not bless you!"</p>
<p>Then the boys ran away.</p>

<p>During the New York Marathon, I was crossing the street around the six-mile mark. All of a sudden somebody grabbed me and embraced me.</p>
<p>It was an older gentleman from Hawaii who had run one of our races. He said, "My wife and I are your great admirers. We ran your 24-hour race, and tomorrow we shall come to your concert at Lincoln Center."</p>
<p>He was wearing all kinds of plants and leaves around himself and a Hawaiian skirt. It was his costume for the New York Marathon.</p>

<p>I came down to the lobby of the Sun Route Hotel in Tokyo around five o'clock in the morning in order to go running. I wanted to run for forty-five minutes or so. I was determined that I would not make any wrong turns or get lost, because I wanted to come back in an hour.</p>
<p>But God wanted me to run longer! I was running and running and, as usual, I totally forgot my landmarks. So I got lost very nicely.</p>
<p>Finally, at six-thirty, I said, "Now I have to make inquiries." So I started asking people where the Sun Route Hotel was. When I said, "Sun Route," they did not understand my English. I had to say, "Sun Routo." But even then nobody could help me.</p>
<p>I said, "Fine, nobody knows where it is!" So I continued my journey. Then I saw a taxi driver and I asked him for directions. He spoke English well. He said to me, "It is quite far. You get in."</p>
<p>I said, "But I have no money."</p>
<p>He said, "Oh no, you do not have to pay."</p>
<p>I told him, "But I want to run."</p>
<p>"It is quite far," he said again.</p>
<p>I said, "I will enjoy running."</p>
<p>He was so nice. He took a sheet of paper and wrote down the directions. "You go to the station and make a right turn."</p>
<p>So I continued running and came to the station, which was quite far. But instead of making a right turn, I made a left turn and got lost once more. Then I saw a policeman, who showed me which was the right direction.</p>
<p>Finally, I got tired and started walking. God knows where I was. Then I saw Projjwal and Pravaha running along the street. I said, "That means the hotel is very near."</p>
<p>They told me, "Make a left turn and then a right." Then they continued running.</p>
<p>For me, right and left are all the same! So again I got lost. Finally, I took a taxi back to the hotel because I was tired of running. The taxi ride lasted seven minutes. Altogether, for two hours I was out running and walking.</p>

<p>During our race in Fukuyama, I was running along the one-mile course. I saw Padmasini running about forty metres ahead of me. She was alone.</p>
<p>There was a big stone marking the turn-around point, but she did not go up to the stone. Before reaching it, she just turned around and went back. I thought, "How clever Padmasini is! There is such a big mark at the turn-around point, but she pretends not to see it."</p>
<p>I thought that since nobody was there, she was taking a shortcut. But I did not have the heart to say anything. Afterwards, I found out that she had already finished the race and was just doing some more walking and running.</p>

<p>Four or five times in Japan I saw Senani running. When I see somebody who is older than I am jogging and running, it gives me such joy and inspiration. I can only walk and limp; but he is so tall and his strides are so long. I was admiring him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>When elderly people run or do physical exercise, it inspires the younger generation. In the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Nolini started running again after turning 65. Some of you people are 28 or 29, but you are acting as if you were ancient.</p>
<p>Those who do physical activity give me immense joy, and those who do not take exercise have to develop a new heart to feel my sadness.</p>

<p>Always people stop me at the 300-metre mark of our race course in Flushing Meadow Park. Yesterday, before the "Runners Are Smilers" race, somebody stopped me at that mark and said, "Can you tell me how to get to the train station?"</p>
<p>Then today it happened again. I was warming up before the start of our five-mile race. At about my second mile, which was at the 300-metre mark on the course, a runner came up to say hello. "Do you have the time?" he asked.</p>
<p>I said, "I have no watch, so I am not sure. It is around seven-thirty. The race has not started, so you will not miss it."</p>
<p>He said, "But I want to practise."</p>
<p>Then he went to one of the disciples to ask the time. That disciple told him, "It is exactly seven-thirty." Then the runner was reassured and he went to practise. Every time I go to the 300-metre mark, somebody comes and asks me for something. That is the place!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Morning blessings</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Morning blessings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I went out to run at around six o'clock. At that time my disciples were all meditating at home, but I was meditating on the street while running. As usual, my route was along Queens Boulevard. I stopped only once, at the Main Street intersection, and rested a little because my body demanded it. So I surrendered to my body and then started running again.</p>
<p>On the way back, I was in a very high consciousness — in another world. All of a sudden, I saw the soul of one of our newer disciples from the New York Centre. Her soul asked me for special blessings so she could fulfil the inner promises she had made this year. I was very pleased. Immediately I blessed the soul with utmost concern and poured solid determination into the soul. Then, shortly afterwards, I saw someone on the street who looked like my rabbi, Sanatan. I was on the street and he was on the sidewalk. There was a van and a car in between us, but his vibration I still got.</p>
<p>Around my 400-metre mark on 150th Street, I was dying with exhaustion. Then I saw someone running towards me, but I could not recognise her. When she passed me, immediately I felt the vibration of her soul. Although my eyes could not recognise her, I got a vibration from her soul. It was the same New York disciple whom I had blessed earlier.</p>
<p>So I stopped and screamed at her. She also stopped. I told her, "I just blessed your soul. Go straight and make a left turn to my 900-metre mark. Then stand there and meditate."</p>
<p>Hundreds of things like this happen every day. I do not tell you people how many times your souls come to me for special blessings, affection and love. But your souls come to me only if you are in a good consciousness. If you are in a bad consciousness, your souls know how to sleep! If you are sincere, if you are determined, then your souls will definitely come to me again and again for extra blessings, affection, concern and determination to fulfil your promises.</p>

<p>At the inauguration of the Sri Chinmoy Peace Mile in London, the weather was mild and excellent. It was very unusual for England. Believe it or not, the sun actually came out! Everybody was so happy that we were blessed by the presence of the sun.</p>
<p>All around the one-mile loop there were beautiful blue flags, quite small, and large pictures of important runners. They started with Robert de Castella's picture, then some English runners, and ended with Sebastian Coe's picture — as if he were finishing first.</p>
<p>There were also twelve stone plaques on the course with the inscription 'Sri Chinmoy Peace Mile.' There was also a big plaque that told our ideals and philosophy in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Thirty metres away from the starting line there were four golden statues of Lord Buddha in a peace pagoda. Right near the start was the River Thames, which runs along about 800 metres of the course. It was all very beautiful!</p>
<p>I always speak about enthusiasm. This time the British have shown enthusiasm from beginning to end. How cheerfully they worked together! In terms of happiness, enthusiasm, warmth and oneness, this race far surpassed all the races we have ever held, including those in New York. I always say, "Become, and then go beyond." So they have become one with all the good qualities that New York offers in its races, and they have gone far beyond.</p>
<p>The big shots who came were so nice! How kindly and respectfully they talked to me. I was so deeply moved.</p>

<p>The Mayor and the Commissioner of the Park were at the opening ceremony of the London Peace Mile. There were also a Nobel laureate and a Minister on the stage. For the opening they asked me to release peace doves. I said that I would like the Mayor to release them.</p>
<p>The Mayor said he would do so only on one condition: I had to be on the stage beside him. So we stood together, and he released the doves.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The great runners</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The great runners" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>So many runners came to the inauguration of our Peace Mile in London. Many were former Olympians — some from 1948, some from 1956. There was also a British Olympian who had stood fourth in the 10,000-metre race in the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. Now he is training for the next Olympics.</p>
<p>I had a very long talk with him. I said, "You will get another chance in Korea."</p>
<p>He replied, "This time, if I do not get a medal, I will give up." He had seen a video of me lifting 200 pounds and he was very impressed. He said he used to lift 40 pounds, but it was too much for him.</p>
<p>I said, "You do not need to do it."</p>
<p>There was also a runner from Iran who holds eight Asian records. He was very humble and very nice. He was appreciating me like anything, and I also was appreciating him. He feels I have special blessings from Allah. He also gives all credit to Allah for his running success.</p>
<p>Then, an ex-Olympian from the 1948 Olympics came over to introduce himself to me. He said, "I am a friend of Dhrubha Hein's father." This world of ours is so small! Here I was in London and I met a friend of Dhrubha's father.</p>
