<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the highest art form, the absolutely highest art, the supreme art for a seeker, is the art of God-realisation. God-realisation has to be achieved through aspiration and dedication. Aspiration and dedication go together. If you become a musician for your livelihood, you have to feel that your work is not work, but is a dedicated service to the Supreme. If you take it as work, a kind of work you do in order to make money, then it is not art. When you are playing, you have to aspire to reach the Highest, and you have to feel that you are dedicating your capacity, your willingness, or your achievement to the Supreme in yourself. If you do that, it is the best art on earth, the highest supreme art in your life of aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to read a few spiritual books. Then you pray to the Supreme to give you the necessary inspiration and necessary capacity. If you read a few spiritual plays, your physical mind will be trained to some extent on how to use the form of the play. That does not mean that you are copying somebody else’s play. No! You learn the style, the form, but form is not life; form is the body. Inside the body the soul has to come, spirit has to come. Then if you pray to the Supreme for the capacity, which is inspiration, when you get capacity you will already know the form. Then you have to give it spirit. In order to add spirit from above, you have to invoke the Light of the Supreme or invoke the Supreme. When spirit enters the form, it is like life entering the body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality and art always go together to the same Goal. You can say spirituality is the road which leads to the destination, and art is a traveller walking along the road. If the road reaches the Goal without a traveller, then the road is not satisfied. Because it has not carried anybody, because nobody has walked along it, the road feels useless. Again, if there is no road, how will the traveller reach his destination?</p>
<p>Art is the earth-traveller, the pilgrim, and spirituality is the road. When both reach their common destination, both feel that they are satisfied. Both art and spirituality have one Goal, and that Goal is supreme Joy, supreme Delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The supreme duty of an artist is to meditate before he creates something and, while creating, to be in a very contemplative, divine mood. Then, when the creation is completed, he will immediately place his creation at the Feet of the Lord Supreme. No matter what others say about his creation, no matter what his feelings are about his own creation, as soon as his creation is completed, he will place it at the Feet of the Supreme for Him to use in His own way. This is the supreme duty of the spiritual artist.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! Prayer and meditation are the only way. Many people are not born poets or born artists. But by practising meditation, they bring into their system literary capacities, painting capacities, musical capacities, because meditation means new life. When new life enters into you, you become a new man. Before, you were not an artist, let us say. God gave you a particular type of life, with particular capacities. But when a new life enters into you, that means a new opportunity, a new avenue, a new light enters. At that time you can easily acquire the capacity of art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a seeker has more than one artistic tendency, he has to decide which one gives him the greatest satisfaction. Because I am a spiritual man I have a little mastery over various art forms. I have talent for writing poems and I also have talent for writing other things, like plays. But I have to say I have more talent for writing poems. I can easily write one hundred poems every day if I want to. Writing poetry for me is like drinking water. But even three plays a day would be very difficult for me. That is because in the literary field, poetry is much closer to spirituality than plays or stories or essays and articles. In India a poet is called a Seer of the Truth. He who sees is called <em>Kavi</em>, the Seer-poet. Why should I constantly exercise my spiritual capacity in order to write a few plays, when poetry comes spontaneously to me, with practically no effort at all? If I have to say which literary art I prefer, I will naturally say poetry; I will definitely give much more importance to my poetry than to plays or stories or other things.</p>
<p>In your case, if you have two or three artistic capacities, you should try to develop whichever one gives you most joy and whichever comes to you spontaneously. Again, there is nothing wrong if you try to develop or increase your capacities in various art forms. Why do you have to restrict yourself only to poetry or to music if you have other talents as well? In sports we have the decathlon for those athletes who are all-round athletes. Similarly, if you have the capacity to do well in ten items, why be satisfied with only one? Again, it is not good to be a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none. If that saying applies to you, then the best thing is to find out which form of creative activity gives you most spontaneous joy. That will be the right one for you to concentrate on developing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The colour silver does have a special significance which is applicable in any field. It means purity. When one sees this colour during meditation, one has to know that he has achieved tremendous progress in his life in terms of purity. When you see the colour silver, at that time you have to feel that your mind is becoming pure, your vital is becoming pure, your body-consciousness is becoming pure. Silver is purity. This also applies to the colour silver in art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through aspiration you can do it. Even if you do two hundred paintings badly, still you have the aspiration to do something good. You are not painting for money or for any other earthly motives. If one is a really sincere seeker, his aspiration gives life to his art. But how many artists will you find who are sincere seekers? Most artists keep aspiration totally outside their art. Naturally, they will not succeed in making their art spiritual.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! All art, without fail, is an expression of the Supreme’s Beauty. Art is beauty and beauty is art. Art, beauty and joy are like three brothers. When Keats said, “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,” he was so right because joy is beauty itself. Keats said something else which is also extremely important, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.” Truth represents the Highest. When Beauty becomes one with Truth, naturally Beauty also becomes the Highest, which is none other than God. Art is God’s creation, God’s expression. When you think of art and God’s Beauty, you will see that they are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin: they are inseparable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always through conscious dedication. Conscious dedication means that you are offering yourself to something to please it in its own way. If you are dedicating yourself to something with the idea that one day you will achieve it or acquire it and then utilise it in your own way, that is not real dedication at all. If you want to make money so that you will be able to use it in your own way, this is wrong. But if you want to make money so that the Supreme can utilise you and your money in His own way, if you have that kind of attitude, then automatically you get strength and warmth in your life.</p>
<p>If someone who is superior uses us in his own way, automatically we get strength and energy; and the Supreme is our real superior. But when we want to do something for our own sake, even when we want to throw ourselves into it heart and soul because we know that ultimately we will be able to control it and regulate it, often strength, enthusiasm and warmth do not come. Again, when we are insincere we feel that if we can do something in our own way, then there is no need to listen to the Inner Pilot, the Supreme. We think that if He uses us in His way, we will become slaves and have to surrender to Him. But the moment we become sincere seekers, it pains us deeply whenever we do something in our own way without first approaching Him. If we do even one thing without His knowledge, His approval, His permission, His direction, then we feel miserable. Warmth, energy and strength sincere seekers get only when we know that we are doing something to please and fulfil our superior, the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that each hour in your life is a page of your life-book, and that you are studying, memorising and utilising the wisdom of that page in your life. Every hour you have to feel that you have studied one particular page of your life-book. When the wisdom of that page enters into you, immediately there appears in you a form of creativity. Creativity does not only mean writing poems or stories. No! Creativity can be inside one’s heart: creativity can take place inside one’s body-consciousness. Creativity means a kind of manifestation inside you. When you study that particular page, the wisdom recorded there is spread inside your being. That is called creativity. If you can feel that every hour is a page in your life-book and that you are studying it, then every action of yours will be an art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! When Arjuna and Krishna engaged in battle against the asuric forces, the undivine forces of the Kauravas, it was an art. It was the art of justice, the art of light-manifestation on earth, the art of truth’s supremacy over falsehood. The very battle was an art, a supreme art which wanted to conquer the ignorance that was prevailing in the world at that time. To conquer ignorance, to conquer undivine forces, is a true form of art, because when you conquer ignorance, you clear the path for light, the light that needs constant expansion, constant manifestation. So what else can that battle have been but a pure form of art, the supreme art the art of realising the truth, the art of revealing the truth and the art of manifesting the truth.</p>
