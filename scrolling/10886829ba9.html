<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have not come into the world to compete with anybody else, only to compete with myself. I am trying to transcend myself and I ask my students to do the same. I am not going to compete with a third person. But I know my capacity or incapacity. If I know what my capacity is, tomorrow I will try to transcend it. In our philosophy, transcendence is perfection. Transcendence is not something stagnant, like a pool. No, transcendence is like a river; it is always flowing. So I always compete with myself. If I can lift 40 pounds, then I will try to lift 50 pounds, then 60 pounds. If I can write one soulful poem, then I will try to write two poems.</p>
<p>I get joy from competing with myself. And I think that by competing with myself, I am making myself a better person. Others do the same perhaps. Again, who am I to talk about others? If they want to compete with the rest of the world, that is fine. In my case, I derive satisfaction from my self-transcendence. I know what I have and what I am. I feel that what I have and what I am is nothing, nothing, in comparison to the goal that I have set for myself. So if I want to reach my goal, then I have to transcend and transcend.</p>
<p>And then the goal itself is also transcending. There was a time when my goal was to learn the alphabet. Then it became something higher. In life also, no matter which subject we study, either an inner subject or an outer subject, there is no end to our wisdom.</p>

<p>It is the wish of every human being to fly in the sky. If we fly in the sky, we believe that we will become as vast as the sky itself. Then we will enjoy freedom, the real freedom, divine freedom. The whole purpose of these lifts is to have inner freedom. With inner freedom we get peace of mind.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>This is a tangible way for me to be associated with the flight of the aeroplanes. In an outer sense, lifting up aeroplanes is great fun. In an inner sense, there is a great symbolic meaning. An aeroplane reminds us of how we want our consciousness to fly from country to country throughout the length and breadth of the world, in the skies of Infinity. Aeroplanes bring countries closer than the closest and, at the same time, they give us the message of the unknowable Infinity. Therefore, I am so happy to be prayerfully associated with the flight of the aeroplane.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My diet is absurd, to tell you the truth! I was 180 pounds a few months ago and I wanted to lose weight, so I started taking only 200 calories per day, believe it or not. For two months I took 200 calories, sometimes 250 calories maximum. In that way, I came down from 180 pounds to 144. Yesterday my bodyweight was 143 pounds.</p>
<p>But I do not advise anybody to follow my diet. It applies to me but medical science will say that it is absurd, ridiculous. I have about fifteen students who are also medical doctors. They are shocked that I could live on 200 calories. Even yesterday, before I left in the evening to lift up such heavy weights, I took only 200 calories. So my way is absurdity.</p>
<p><em>CBS:</em> Are you a vegetarian?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a strict vegetarian. We have an Indian restaurant in this neighbourhood. It is called Annam Brahma. My students there cook for me. I have been a strict vegetarian for over fifty years. I feel that if we eat vegetables, we will absorb the consciousness of Mother Earth. Mother Earth is so kind and compassionate to us, and she has infinite strength. But if we eat meat and fish, we absorb the aggressive and restless consciousness of the animal kingdom. We believe that this restlessness weakens us. So my students all over the world do not eat meat and fish. We are trying to get rid of this restlessness which we find in the animal world.</p>
<p><em>CBS:</em> It was a pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much for your time.</p>

<p>I am so grateful that we were able to have so many eminent bodybuilders with us. Mahasamrat Bill Pearl, Frank Zane, Dan Lurie, Wayne DeMilia and Mike Katz have all contributed so much to the world at large in their own fields. We received from them so much inspiration. Their kind words I take most sincerely as real blessings.</p>
<p>I was a total stranger to this bodybuilding world until the last few years. This was a world I could not appreciate. But now God, my Lord Beloved Supreme, says that I must appreciate each and every thing in life and bring to the fore its inner beauty, inner fragrance, inner divinity and inner reality. So my Lord Supreme is giving me a new lesson with this weightlifting world. This was a lesson I disliked immensely and intensely, but now this weightlifting lesson is inspiring me far beyond my imagination. And now this lesson is also becoming a source of inspiration to countless human beings who believe in a oneness-world-heart.</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that I am doing this weightlifting on the strength of my mind-power. They are totally mistaken. I do not use any power. But if there is something called an inherent divinity which every human being is endowed with, then it is the oneness-heart-power. It is the oneness-heart-power in me that enables me to do these things. And perhaps there will be many more things that will be accomplished by the Supreme in me on the strength of this oneness-heart-power. Needless to say, this oneness-heart-power is God's unconditional, unconditional, unconditional Compassion that is working in and through me for the improvement, betterment and enlightenment of humanity.</p>

<p>I wanted to serve God spiritually. God said, "No, I want you to serve Me physically as well." I never, never imagined that I would enter into the weightlifting world. Weightlifting I most sincerely hated. I thought that only brainless people do weightlifting! That was my firm conviction. So God said, "All right, then you be one of those brainless people!"</p>
<p>Now I have come to learn that inside weightlifting there is heart involved. That is why so many world figures, university professors and so forth, come to be lifted, because they see that what we are doing is all heart, all heart.</p>
<p>This weightlifting has connected the spiritual and the physical. That is why we have been so successful. Over 7,000 people I have now lifted. Our programme is called "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart." Two simple words are most important: 'lift' and 'oneness'. We all want to be lifted. How? On the strength of oneness.</p>
<p>So here the physical and the spiritual can go together, of course if we get unconditional Grace from the highest Absolute Supreme. Otherwise, some individuals are only for the physical; spirituality is not involved in their life. And again, others care only for the spiritual aspect. Either they are afraid of uniting the physical and the spiritual, or it is beneath their dignity to enter into the physical. There are very few spiritual figures who try to combine the spiritual and the physical. I happen to be one of those.</p>
<p>Spirit and matter must go together. Without matter, divinity cannot be manifested. The physical is the foundation. Similarly, without spirituality, matter is useless. Matter and spirit need each other. Matter, let us say, is the temple and the spirit is the shrine. Again, inside matter, spirit is always inherent. Otherwise, spirit could not have manifested if it was not already there.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that we do not have to become a world champion, but physical fitness is of paramount importance, along with our prayers and meditations. If we are wise, then let us pay most sincere attention to the physical, the way we pay attention to the spiritual. Otherwise, physical ailments will not allow us to pray and meditate. The physical and the spiritual must go side by side.</p>
<p>True, I am saying they must go side by side, but I will never tell you to give fifty per cent of your attention to the spiritual and fifty per cent to the physical — never, never! Eighty per cent you can take as spiritual and twenty per cent as physical. But if you give one hundred per cent to the spiritual, then your physical existence will be totally useless, and if you give one hundred per cent to the physical, then you will be bankrupt spiritually.</p>
<p>I have some students who give much more importance to the physical and neglect the spiritual. I feel sorry. They are making an Himalayan blunder. Luckily there are very few of that type. And again, there are others who pay no attention either to the physical or to the spiritual. They are wallowing in the pleasures of lethargy. Luckily I am not one of those. So I beg them to at least pay attention to one of the two, either the physical or the spiritual.</p>
<p>There should be a balance, balance, balance.</p>
