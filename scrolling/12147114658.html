 <p>
UT 36-38. On the evening of 25 May 1973, U Thant attended the first performance of <em>Siddhartha becomes the Buddha</em>, a series of one-act plays based on incidents in the life of the Lord Buddha, written by Sri Chinmoy and performed by his disciples on an outdoor stage built for the occasion at Old Mill Farm in Harrison, New York. U Thant was accompanied by his daughter, son-in-law and young grandson.</p>
<h2>Speech of welcome by Sri Chinmoy</h2>

<p>[Sri Chinmoy opened the programme by singing:]</p>

<p><em>Buddham saranam gacchami</em><br /><em>Dhammam saranam gacchami</em><br /><em>Sangham saranam gacchami</em></p>

<p>[Sri Chinmoy then gave a speech of welcome and garlanded U Thant. Sri Chinmoy’s remarks follow.]</p>
<p>When I go to the Buddha for refuge, He blesses me.<br />When I go to the inner Law for refuge, He illumines me.<br />When I go to the Order for refuge, He utilises me.</p>
<p>A child of Bihar, a son of India, a citizen of the world, a denizen of the higher spheres: Siddhartha, the Buddha.</p>
<p>In the outer world He is known as the Light of Asia. In the inner world He is, indeed, an ever-illumining Light of the universe.</p>
<p>To the world-sorrows He offered His heart of infinite Compassion. To the world-aspiration He offered His soul of transcendental Illumination.</p>
<p>The Omnipotent did two things. Through Siddhartha Gautama, He revealed the ideal of Perfection in a human being. Through the Buddha, He revealed His Enlightenment and Compassion in a Divine Being.</p>
<p>With His Heart, the Unfathomable came to the Buddha.<br />With His Mind, the Unknowable came to the Buddha.<br />With His Bliss, the Transcendental came to the Buddha.</p>
<p>This evening we are deeply honoured and blessed by the gracious presence of our most esteemed Brother, U Thant. Two thousand five hundred years ago the World-Father, the Buddha, came with the Message of universal Peace. Now, two thousand five hundred years later, He has sent His chosen son, U Thant, to offer the same Message of Peace.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, for ten long years you have served the world-consciousness most devotedly and most significantly through the world body of the United Nations. Mother Earth and Father Heaven have bestowed their choicest blessings on your devoted head, aspiring heart and illumining soul. The outer political world has lost you, but the inner spiritual world has gained you and claims you as its very own. Your silent life of aspiration, dedication and illumination is guiding the outer world and leading it to its destined Goal.</p>
<p>With deepest joy and gratitude I am dedicating this play, <em>Siddhartha becomes the Buddha</em>, as a humble token of my treasured feeling towards you. In you I feel the pioneer-pilot of world-peace. In you I see a beacon-light of world-redemption. And in you I discover true love of human life and an utmost reverence for Truth, both in the inner world and in the outer world.</p>
<p>The Absolute Supreme claims you as His very own. The Lord Buddha claims you as His very own. We, your brothers and sisters of this world, claim you as our very own.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">U Thant’s reply</h2><span property="dc:title" content="U Thant’s reply" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Revered and highly esteemed Sri Chinmoy and brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege to be able to participate in this spiritually rewarding experience. And for this I am most grateful to our esteemed teacher, Sri Chinmoy, for this innovative undertaking. I also feel particularly moved and touched by his very gracious blessing bestowed on me.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy very kindly sent me a copy of the play, <em>Siddhartha becomes the Buddha</em>. I have read it with great interest and with great admiration and profit. Of course, it is extremely difficult to depict the important episodes of the life of the Buddha in the course of a few minutes or an hour or so. But I found that Sri Chinmoy has done a most remarkable job in presenting the play in simple language understandable even to the uninitiated. His stress on the basic characteristics of Buddhism — on compassion, love, renunciation, peace — should stimulate the thoughts of leaders of men and leaders of thought everywhere. As you all are aware, I was brought up as a Buddhist by tradition, by faith and by practice. And I find myself in complete agreement with Sri Chinmoy in his enunciation of the ethical and moral aspects of Buddhism which in my view should be the basis for each of us in our search for inner light, in our search for truth.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy in his play also has drawn a very vivid picture of the identity between God and Truth, soul and inner Light, which I very much hope will create an abiding interest in these two great religions — Hinduism and Buddhism — which in many ways constitute the key to all great religions. I feel very strongly, as some of my friends know, that only by the practical application of the teachings of great religious leaders, particularly the development of the moral and spiritual aspects of life as Sri Chinmoy has stressed in the play — love, compassion, tolerance, the philosophy of live-and-let-live, modesty and even humility — that only with this approach, only with this method, will we all be able to fashion the kind of society we want, a truly moral society, a decent society, a livable society, which is the goal of all great religions.</p>
<p>I want to thank particularly those friends who are participating in this play. I wish all of you peace of mind and eternal joy, and particularly the inner joy. Thank you very much, Sri Chinmoy, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p>

<h2>U Thant's recovery</h2>

<p>Let us most fervently pray for the recovery of our most revered brother, U Thant, who is now in the hospital. As long as he is in the hospital, it is my fervent wish that every day we shall pray to the Supreme for his quick recovery. I have sent flowers to the hospital on behalf of our Meditation Group here.</p>
<p>Not because U Thant was once the Secretary-General but because he is a great seeker of Truth and a true love of mankind, I wish all of us to pray to the Supreme for his quick recovery. He is our real spiritual brother, and it is our bounden duty to pray for him. Even though he is not in the political arena any longer, still his presence o earth is a great blessing for humanity.</p>
<p>While he was in the field of politics there were many things which he could not say or do. Owing to pressure from the world at large, he was unable to enter into the real divine life. Now, since he has freed himself from the United Nations, his inner life has come to the fore and he has become a real divine hero.</p>
<p>When his memoirs are published, we will see the real seeker and the real God-lover in him. May God’s transcendental Blessing and God’s highest Pride rain on his illumining head and consecrated heart.</p>
<p>Now, for a few minutes, let us most fervently pray for his recovery.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr /><ol><li id="fn1"><p>UT 39. On two separate occasions when U Thant was hospitalised, Sri Chinmoy requested the members of the United Nations Meditation Group to pray for his recovery. The first time was on 4 November 1971, following a lecture Sri Chinmoy delivered as part of his monthly Dag Hammarskjold Series. The second occasion was on 8 March 1974. At that time Sri Chinmoy said this.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>

<p>[In silence the Group meditated on a photograph of U Thant which stood surrounded by flowers on the altar of the Chapel.]</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy offered his prayerful tribute:]</p>
<p>“Beloved Brother, man of silence, man of peace, may the Supreme grant your soul Eternity’s Silence, Infinity’s Peace.”</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy then quietly addressed the Group:]</p>
<p>“The passing of our beloved Brother U Thant marks the real death of a colossal hope for the twentieth century. Divinely great he was; supremely good he is. The greatness of his earth-height his body-consciousness is carrying. The goodness of his Heaven-Delight his soul has left for us, for Mother Earth to claim as her very own and treasure forever and ever.</p>
<p>We the members of the United Nations Meditation Group, have a special place for him, for our beloved Brother U Thant, in the inmost recesses of our gratitude-heart, for he has helped us unreservedly with his aspiring heart and with his illumining soul, both inwardly and outwardly. We have been extremely fortunate in being blessed by his soul’s light. I have received from him quite a few letters of deepest light and profoundest wisdom encouraging us and inspiring us to be of greater service to the soul of the United Nations and to aspiring mankind.”</p>

UT 44-50. U Thant’s death left the whole world deeply bereaved. These are some reminiscences about the late Secretary-General.</p>
<h2>Kurt Waldheim</h2>

<p>Why does the world remember U Thant? We are extremely fortunate to have the most apposite answer by none other than his great successor Kurt Waldheim: “His integrity and his courage were rooted in his firm Buddhist faith and in an unshakable belief in humanity and in the necessity of improving the quality of lives of all mankind. We remember him for his achievements and for the difficulties he faced in presiding over our Organization for ten tumultuous years.”</p>
