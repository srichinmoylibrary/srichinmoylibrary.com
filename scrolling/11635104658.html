<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we are observing divine silence and not human silence. In human silence we may keep our mouth shut, but our mind is constantly talking, scolding and insulting. The mind is doing everything. But if we can maintain divine silence, then from this divine silence we will immediately get Light from God. Then we can offer this Light to the persons who are creating problems for us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say that it is through inner cry that you raise your consciousness, and in order to maintain your highest consciousness you have to establish considerable purity in the vital.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In awareness, you can see around you; you are aware of another person, of the room, of how you are standing, of how you are sitting or of how you are talking. But consciousness is far deeper and broader. When there is consciousness, there need not be a subject and object. Consciousness merely exists. In it the individual merges and becomes one with the universal Reality. There is no separation of individuality, for the One is infused with all that exists. Consciousness is not a personal quality, but an all-embracing cosmic identity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we try to keep our working areas neat and tidy, or can we work well in clutter?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we try to keep our working areas neat and tidy, or can we work well in clutter?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a young man my first job was as an electrician. My boss had come to the conclusion that in this world God has created two types of people: those who will make a mess, and those who will clean up the mess. We have to care for perfection. You are saying we should keep our work area clean. I fully agree. If you clean before you start working, you may say that you are losing ten minutes time, but actually you will accomplish more. These things I can say hundreds of times, but people who do not have from within a sense of cleanliness will never be really clean. I have been praying for my disciples to take showers. Still six or seven don't. If cleanliness is not in the person, then how much can you inject?</p>
<p>Whose responsibility is it to keep the place clean: the boys' or the girls'? On the one hand, masculine pride prevents the boys from cleaning, and on the other hand, they are incapable. The boys feel that the girls have to do it. The girls feel that it is the boys' unpardonable incapacity. There are many things boys cannot do, but girls can do. I have to give a boy twenty-four hours to keep his room clean, but if I give a girl five minutes she will do it. What will take him twenty-four hours to do, she will do in five minutes. And his sense of cleanliness will differ from hers. He will say that his room is clean. But when you go there, you will be surprised.</p>
<p>So the standard of cleanliness is different. The boys' and the girls' standard of cleanliness is different. The boys' standard is no standard at all. A husband will think that everything is perfect, but as soon as his wife goes there, you will see a real sense of cleanliness. These are realities in life. In my own room, I make it absolutely a beer-garden. The girl disciples will clean it. Here I am representing the boys. Our standard is really unbearable. In this world there are people who really maintain a good standard of cleanliness. Even if I ask others to do the same cleaning, they will do it, but it will be far below the standard of the others. So those with high standards have to do cleaning.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago I went to our press, and there I saw such a mess. I could not stay more than five minutes. Then I pleaded with the girls, and they went and cleaned up the mess. When the press is untidy and dirty, we just invite accidents. When the press is not clean, already the undivine forces have entered, and then undivine forces create accidents for us. So cleanliness helps us considerably.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great difference between self-enquiry and self-deprecation. Self-enquiry is the precursor of self-discovery. Who am I? What am I here for? The great spiritual Master named Ramana Maharshi from South India used to ask these questions. Unless you want to know who you are, how are you going to know what you are here for?</p>
<p>First we start with enquiry; then it becomes discovery. But in self-deprecation, we limit ourselves in our own estimation. Let us not be bloated with pride, for that would be a mistake. But if constantly we find fault with ourselves and just curse ourselves every moment we get the opportunity, then again that is wrong. It is a way of expressing our false modesty. We know what we are. If we are sincere, then we are bound to know what kind of life we are leading and what we are offering to mankind. If we are sincere, then we can be more sincere. If we are aspiring, then we can aspire more. There is no end to our progress. But if we constantly find fault with ourselves, then we are making a mistake.</p>
<p>Self-enquiry leads to self-discovery. Self-deprecation leads to unconscious, if not conscious, destruction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you please explain psychic emotion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you please explain psychic emotion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The psychic being can exist only in human beings. The soul is in everything: inside this wall, in the table, everywhere you can see the presence of the soul. But the psychic being you cannot see here in a piece of wool or in an animal. Only when a human being comes into existence will you see the flash of the psychic being. This psychic being is the immortal child within us. It is the representative of our inner soul. It has infinite possibilities to lead us into the highest, into the purest, into Eternity. The psychic being abides inside our heart. It is all purity, all light and all delight.</p>
<p>First we get the glimpse of this psychic being, and gradually we enter into the domain of the psychic being. Then we play with the psychic being, talk, mix, and do all the things we can do with our human, earthly children. The moment we see the psychic being within us, we feel that we are truly children of God. When we see our oneness with the psychic being, we feel that the psychic being is ours. This makes us feel that we are not only the perfect children of God, but also that in us is the seed that will eventually grow into God. This means that everyone without exception will one day realise God and become God. This is the message that we get from the psychic being.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To have simplicity is to run towards God without darkness, worries or impurity. Simplicity is running towards the goal. Sincerity means that the seeker wants only the goal and not the flowers and fruits that are along the road. Humility comes when he reaches the goal. He knows that it is not his capacity that has brought him to the goal. Simplicity is beauty; sincerity is duty; they produce humility. Humility is God-reality, God-oneness and God-perfection. Humility not only embodies the Vast, but it is also the infinite, the Eternal. It is not something to become, but it is God the Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like very much to work on accepting God&#039;s outer Body, the world, and also on accepting my conflicts. How can I begin to do this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like very much to work on accepting God&#039;s outer Body, the world, and also on accepting my conflicts. How can I begin to do this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you accept yourself and how can you accept the outer world? Now, before you answer this question, try to answer another question: "Why to accept?" Then your task becomes easier. How to accept? There are many ways, but all ways will be fruitless if you do not know why to accept humanity or yourself.</p>
<p>First you have to accept yourself; then you can think of accepting humanity. Why should you accept yourself? You should accept yourself because the Lord, who is all-Love, all-Mercy, all-Compassion, all-Protection and all-Power, has accepted you and is utilising you as His chosen instrument. He has accepted you; this is the main reason why you should accept yourself. The infinite has accepted the finite and through the finite the Infinite wants to express Himself. What greater reason do you need to feel divinely proud? When you feel that the infinite has accepted you to express Himself, then with the deepest joy and pride you are in a position to accept yourself.</p>
<p>Now, how to accept the outer world? If you see the world as something around you or outside you, then it can never be your world. This world can be your world only when you see it inside yourself, as part of yourself. Then you possess the world. If you see the world as something around you, then either the world possesses you or you feel that there is a vast gulf, a yawning gap between you and the world. But if you see the world inside you, then there is no gap. The world is yours, your possession.</p>
<p>What do you do with your possession? You utilise it. Either you utilise it in a wrong way or in a right way, but you have the capacity and the right to utilise the world inside you because it is your possession. If it is not your possession, then you cannot do that. So how to accept the world? First try to see and feel the world inside you. When you see the world inside you, then automatically you accept the world.</p>
<p>Then, do not expect anything while you are bringing the outer world inside you. Do not think that you will do something grand, something marvellous for the world and do not expect anything from the world. If you expect, then you are bound to be disappointed. Your expectation must lie in the Supreme. If you want to expect something, then you have to expect it from the Supreme in the world, but not directly from the world. If you ask a man to help you with something in some way, then he will be the cause of your frustration. But if you ask the Supreme in him and pray to the Supreme in him for a favour, then that particular person is going to help you.</p>
<p>If you want to know how you can accept the world, I wish to tell you, accept the Supreme in man and see in him more perfection than imperfection. Consciously try to see more truth in him than falsehood. See his positive side, his brighter part. Each individual represents the world. So when you are trying to bring the world inside you, do not take it as imperfection, bondage, limitation and death. No, take it as something which has infinite possibility to do something wonderful and unique for the Supreme and for yourself. In that way it becomes extremely easy for you to bring the outer world into yourself and make yourself feel that it is you who have to take care of the inner world, this world inside you. Only do not allow the world to remain around you or outside you.</p>
<p>How to accept? I tell you, you will be able to accept the world by changing your attitude toward the world. The world is doomed to disappointment, the world is going to the dogs, the world is past perfection; these ideas you have to throw out. The world carries the message of God; the world is bound to be the Kingdom of Heaven. This world is really God's chosen field. Here He will manifest and here He will fulfil Himself. With these ideas if we look at the world, then we will see that easily we will be able to accept the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we know when we should forgive a person who has injured us, and when we should retaliate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we know when we should forgive a person who has injured us, and when we should retaliate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of people. One type is like a monkey or a scorpion. If we allow a monkey to approach us, it will bite and pinch us immediately. If we touch a scorpion, first it will sting our hand. If we touch it again, it will bite us again. So in this world we have to see if someone is constantly trying to destroy us. If ignorance is not decreasing we have to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>But when the Christ saw that his own people were constantly fighting, he said that there are some people of a good nature whom we should forgive because they sincerely try to do the right thing. If somebody of this type has done something wrong and we forgive him, then he will not do it again because he will know that he has done something wrong. If we tell him, "All right, you have done it. Now don't do it again," he will be ashamed and embarrassed. He will feel repentant that he has done something wrong. Since he has a good nature, he will not do it a second time. But if somebody has the nature of a scorpion or a monkey, we can give him as many chances as we want, but he will not change his nature. So with him we have to be very strict. If somebody is by nature like a scorpion and we give him a chance, he will simply kill us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like you to describe for us the Smile of the Supreme.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like you to describe for us the Smile of the Supreme." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the Supreme is in unmanifested form, He is just a Face, but when He is manifested or when He wants to manifest Himself, He has to give out a smile. He is alive, He is functioning, He is dynamic, He is active. This we can know only when we see a smile dawn on His Face. When we speak of the Supreme, we have to know that He is both masculine and feminine. It is very difficult to comprehend this with our human mind. In His masculine Form He is static; He is beyond manifestation, although He does come into manifestation. But when He comes into manifestation, it is through His feminine Form. In our Indian terminology that feminine Form is called <em>Prakriti,</em> or the Nature-Force or the Mother aspect of the Supreme. When the Nature-Force operates in the physical world, we see activity in the Being of the Supreme. And when that activity takes place, we see spontaneous joy all over the Supreme's manifested Form. This joy expresses itself most effectively on the Face of the Supreme in a smile. So we can say that the Living-Force or the Creativity of the Supreme is His Smile. That smile is the very Breath of the Universal Consciousness, as well as the Breath of the Supreme Himself. If there is no smile, there is no breath; and if there is no breath, then the creation remains unmanifested. So in the very Smile of the Supreme the creation starts functioning.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between attachment and compassion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between attachment and compassion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In attachment we act conditionally; in compassion we act unreservedly, eternally and unconditionally. Attachment is our self-imposed activity; whereas compassion is our God-inspired, God-revealing, and God-manifesting activity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How much sleep is necessary for a seeker?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How much sleep is necessary for a seeker?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on how much will-power you have that can create receptivity in the body. If your will-power can create receptivity in the physical consciousness, then only one or two hours, or even less, is necessary. If you can't create receptivity, then it is always advisable to take rest. Otherwise, the consciousness does not function properly. If the consciousness does not function, then we are worse than animals. It not only does not function; what is worse, it becomes destructive. Destruction takes place in the form of negative feelings towards everything, towards your own existence. If you cherish negative feelings, that is real death.</p>
