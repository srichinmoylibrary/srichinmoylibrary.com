  <h2 id="page-title">Confidence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Confidence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There is a great difference between confidence and over-confidence. Over-confidence is of the mind and for the mind, whereas confidence is an inner light. With that inner light, we illumine our mind's darkness. So when we feel the light-ray inside our heart, that ray starts illumining the darkness of our mind. When we have confidence, we feel that God is not only with us and in us but also for us.</p>
<p>But when we are surcharged with over-confidence, at that time we do not need God. We do not need anybody else. We have to know the difference between real confidence and over-confidence. When we discern confidence in our outer life, it is all over-confidence and nothing else. But when we really have confidence in our heart, in our inner life, then it illumines everything that is dark in our life. Confidence is something that is extremely necessary, but we have to be careful in our outer life that this confidence is not over-confidence. Over-confidence is nothing short of destruction.</p>

<p>Detachment is immediate peace. Detachment is wisdom. We are not our creators. Somebody created us. When we can detach ourselves from any person or any object, then we get boundless joy. Detachment is the wisdom-light in us that tells us not to be affected by anything that happens. So many wrong thoughts are coming, so many things are happening in the family, so many things are going wrong in the world—if you can be detached from them, then you will not be affected.</p>
<p>Detachment is not an escape. Detachment is to say, "This is God's world. Let God take care of it. My only obligation is to please God in His own Way. He is the Creator; I am the creation. I can only be of real help to God, real service to God, by praying to Him."</p>
<p>When you try to remain detached, you have to feel that it is your wisdom-light that is coming to the fore. Detachment is not an escape from life. Detachment is a way to see or to feel that God knows that what is happening is for the ultimate good of mankind or for the ultimate good of Mother Earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Divine warrior</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Divine warrior" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are two kinds of warrior: one who conquers with a sword or a gun or some other weapon. That is a human warrior. The other is a divine warrior. This warrior does not conquer; he illumines with light. The divine warrior comes and sees darkness. Light never takes darkness as its enemy, whereas darkness takes light as its enemy. As soon as light, in the form of a divine warrior, stands in front of darkness, light will say, "Oh, my little brother is full of doubt and fear and so many other undivine things. Let me bring water and wash him and make him clean and beautiful." So the divine warrior is always trying to make others as good as himself because he knows he is representing God. But the human warrior will say, "Let me kill that person! He has different views from me. Why should I accept his views? They are all wrong!"</p>
<p>The human way is to destroy; the divine way is to sympathise with our younger brothers and sisters. Darkness is nothing but the younger brother of light. Always there is light, even inside darkness. There is no darkness that does not have an iota of light inside it. The divine warrior thinks of light, more light, abundant light, infinite light. So he will stand in front of darkness and try to illumine it. In that way, he will fulfil God's Vision on earth. The human way is always to destroy. The divine way is to say, "What I am, I want you to be because I know I am representing God on earth and I would like you also to represent God on earth."</p>

<p>Ecstasy can be dynamic; ecstasy can be static. Dynamic ecstasy is what moves us forward, upward and inward. We all need dynamic ecstasy. Static ecstasy lives inside us and cannot be used either for the betterment of ourselves or humanity. Static ecstasy gives us tremendous satisfaction, but that satisfaction we do not need in order to manifest God's Light here on earth. For that, dynamic ecstasy is needed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God tells us that if we lose faith in Him, no harm, but if we lose faith in ourselves, we are finished; the game will be over. So we have to ask ourselves the question, "Who am I? Am I the thought that is entering into me in the form of doubt, in the form of fear, in the form of anxiety?"</p>
<p>If somebody tells you that your name is 'Anxiety', you will vehemently deny it. You will say, "No, my name is such-and-such. It has such a lofty spiritual meaning. My entire existence is flooded with light."</p>
<p>You will not identify yourself with the name 'Anxiety' at all. Nor will you identify yourself with your fears and doubts. At that time, you will separate yourself from these negative thoughts. In the spiritual life, always try to cultivate faith in yourself and in this way you will not identify yourself with any negative qualities. You have to know that when fear, doubt, anxieties and worries come, it is an attack. If anybody calls you by the name 'Worry', are you going to respond? No. But if anybody calls you by the name 'Faith', you will immediately say, "Yes, I am that, I am that, I am that. God has so much faith in me. I have so much faith in God."</p>
<p>In our ordinary human life, we may lose faith in God for two days or four days. Then we will say to ourselves, "This is God's vast Creation! Is He really useless? If He is useless, then He cannot be the Ruler of the world, the Governor of the world." And our faith in God is restored.</p>
<p>But when it comes to our faith in ourselves, all the stupid things that we have done in our lives come forward to destroy our joy. We lose faith in ourselves because twenty years ago perhaps we told a lie. Twenty years ago perhaps somebody asked me which direction to go in Augsburg and I showed him the wrong way! So all kinds of things happen in life. When we deal with our human faith, we are only digging up the past. We remind ourselves of how many bad things we have done. But divine faith is not like that. Divine faith is always going forward, forward, forward. We have to throw our human faith into divine faith. Then we shall be able to go forward.</p>
<p>Even the term 'human' faith is always mixed with doubt because we cannot separate faith from doubt, specially self-doubt. But when it is a matter of divine faith, as soon as we say the word 'divine', beauty comes into our life, light comes into our life. The divine is something beautiful, pure, absolutely glorious. When we say 'divine', immediately light comes to our mind; whereas, when we say 'human', it is always mixed with some negativity, some darkness.</p>
<p>On the human level, there is negativity inside everything and everyone. So when we are dealing with our own faith in ourselves, we have to constantly separate ourselves from doubt because doubt and faith go side by side.</p>
<p>Once we accept the spiritual life, we have to say, "I am of God, I am for God." If you can say this, then immediately you will have faith in yourself. Your faith automatically becomes divine and your anxieties, worries, fears and doubts will all disappear. If you are of God, then how can you be full of doubt?</p>
<p>Then there is another point: whatever you have suffered in your life, it is God who has experienced it in and through you. That same God is now telling you, "Only identify yourself with Me." If we can identify ourselves with God all the time, then all the divine qualities within us will be brought to the fore. Just say, "I am of God. I am for God." Then your doubts will become like a football and you will be able to kick them away. They will not be able to come near you.</p>
<p>If you are really for God, you will be like a deer running towards your Beloved Supreme. Who can prevent you from reaching Him? Our devoted qualities have to run towards God faster than the fastest. When you say, "I am of the Supreme," those little, little animals— doubts, worries and so forth—will all get frightened because they are afraid of light. We are afraid of darkness, but they are afraid of light. So always say, "I am of the Supreme. I am for the Supreme."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot maintain that feeling. When our old worries and anxieties come back into our minds, God disappears. At that time, we do not try to illumine those negative thoughts. We are helpless. In India, one Acharya used to say, by way of joke, "I am a divine warrior, but what can I do? I have a shield in one hand and a sword in the other. My hands are all occupied, so how can I fight?"</p>
<p>But fight we must. Our heart has to say, with all its affection, love, kindness, sweetness and fondness, that we are of God and we are for God. Then we will be able to maintain our feeling. Otherwise, if this idea comes from the mind, we will forget that we are of God and for God sooner than at once. It is our heart that has to say, "All the good qualities that God has given me I am offering to Him, and He will give me much, much more than before because I am of Him and I am for Him."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Illumination</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Illumination" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Illumination is in the mind and of the mind. Illumination and realisation are two brothers; they are twins. They fulfil each other. The mind's illumination and the realisations of the central being go together. The word 'salvation' always gives us the feeling of Master and slave. Somebody infinitely higher than us is granting us salvation. But when it comes to illumination or realisation, then we feel that a dearer than the dearest Friend has come to our rescue. We feel, "I was in darkness, so my dearer than the dearest Friend, my Lord Beloved Supreme, has come to my rescue."</p>
<p>When we want salvation, we always see the difference between the higher and the lower. The higher part has come to save the lower part. But when it is a matter of illumination, at that time we have to feel that the One who has come to illumine us is our dearest Friend, our Eternity's dearest Friend. In the Christian world, we hear the word 'salvation', but we have to know that the meaning is completely different from 'illumination'. For our salvation, we invoke the Master, but in our illumination we already have the Master, God Himself, deep within.</p>
