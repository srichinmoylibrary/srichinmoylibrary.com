<p>Today I was watching Pulak when I was walking. When I walk, people are running so fast. The other day how fast Nilima was running in the street. She was getting ready for the marathon. From time to time I see Natabara. He also runs quite fast. Chandika I never see running. I am killing myself, but she is always in the car. I have also seen Nemi and Jyotsna in the car. Bruce is the best! When I see Bruce, he says "Guru" quite a few times very loudly and then for forty or fifty metres he goes on honking.</p>

<p>This morning I went out three times to walk: at four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock. I want to show that I can maintain strength even after losing forty pounds. The joy of losing weight itself gives me strength!</p>
<p>Anyway, at four o'clock, no human being was visible. At six o'clock also, I was lucky that there was no interference. Then at eight o'clock something cute happened. I saw two of the disciples who work at Aparajita's restaurant. They were cycling. Both of them put their hands on their heart chakra. One of them had proper head gear and the other one did not have. They were extremely devoted.</p>

<p>I turned off 150th Street into the side street and I was coming back to my house. All of a sudden, I saw great Dhrubha's soul, right at the corner of my street. I said something nice about Dhrubha to the soul, and the soul flattered me by saying that it is all my unconditional compassion and concern. I told the soul that before Dhrubha opens up his Divine Enterprise, I will give him a name for the store. Yesterday I went to see two of the places that he had in mind. I rejected one and accepted one, so I am sure the one I accepted he will take immediately.</p>
<p>That particular side street is only 50 or 60 metres long. Then I came to my street. Whom did I see? Drubha. As usual, he was leaving his newspaper clippings inside my door and he was coming out very soulfully and devotedly. I do not think he saw me. He came down the steps and made a left turn. He was going away very soulfully. I can prove that it was Drubha. I am not colour blind. He was wearing green shorts and a white T-shirt.</p>
<p>His soul had come to me just two minutes before but he did not see me. What was he doing? He was adoring his own feet while he was walking! I was only 25 metres behind him. I was watching what he was doing. But he did not see me.</p>
<p>The soul does exist. I do not know what to tell those who do not believe in the soul. But for those who do believe in the soul, Heaven's Door is wide open.</p>

<p>Again at ten o'clock today I went out walking. This was the fourth time. Near my 400-metre mark, just after Sulochana's house, I saw Sandhani vividly. He was standing on the pavement. He was holding a plastic bag or something similar. Then he put his hands on his heart chakra and bowed. I gave him a smile and he gave me a smile. From there I returned home.</p>
<p>Last time I saw him, his better or worse half had to argue with me and say that it was not possible because he does not go out early in the morning. Then it was proved that I was right: I did see him. This time he saw me, greeted me devotedly, and I greeted him blessingfully. So there is no problem!</p>

<p>Some more incidents also took place during the same walk. Savita saw me leave the house wearing a red garment. Then I saw somebody wearing red shorts and a red T-shirt. That person saw me and was hiding behind a bush. I immediately knew that it was Savita who was hiding. Then she came out and was standing there when I went past on the other side of the street. I smiled at her and blessed her very nicely.</p>
<p>Then I went another 50 metres. Whom did I see? Kalpita. She crossed the street and I was going on. Then, when I turned round a few minutes later, I saw Kalpita following me.</p>
<p>Like this, I see all different people when I go out. Last night, when I went out at eight o'clock, I saw Anjali running and running on 150th Street. How could she run at that hour? Savita knew that I had gone out, so she phoned up Anjali.</p>
<p>Our 150th Street is famous. I like it so much. Although 150th Street is full of confusion, it has light. There is less light on the left side, near 148th Street. When I walk there, I do not get so much light from the streets. But on this side, 150th Street, in spite of the fact that restlessness runs riot, I see and feel more light, abundant light, I mean inner light.</p>

<p>This morning I was walking in the airport, at TWA. I took a bottle of water with me and I put it on one of the red seats. At that hour, nobody was there, nobody! Every round I would come and drink a little and then go on. I am supposed to do six rounds and a little more.</p>
<p>After my fourth round, I saw that my water bottle was missing. Then 20 metres ahead of me, I saw that a dark-skinned, fat lady was holding the water bottle. She was the garbage collector.</p>
<p>I screamed, "Oi! Oi! My water, my water!" I began walking very fast towards her. I was practically running. She saw me approaching and then she deliberately threw my bottle into the garbage bin, the one on wheels that they move around with them.</p>
<p>I said, "What have you done? I was screaming! Did you not hear me?"</p>
<p>She said, "Yes, I heard you, but it was too late."</p>
<p>"You were holding it. I was screaming, 'My water!' and you heard me. You were even facing me. You saw that I was coming. How could you throw it away?"</p>
<p>She said, "It is too late." She was saying it the way the police do when they give tickets.</p>
<p>I became disgusted. I said, "Thank you very much."</p>
<p>Then she had to tell me, "Do not be so sercastic." I said, "Sercastic? What is sercastic?"</p>
<p>She said again, "Do not be so sercastic." Instead of saying 'sarcastic', she was saying 'sercastic'.</p>
<p>I said, "I shall give you one hundred dollars if you can spell the word correctly—one hundred dollars!" So she started: "S-r-..." I interrupted her, "That is great! Forget about it."</p>
<p>Then I went away and walked one more round. When I came back to the place, she was still standing there. She said to me, "I am sorry."</p>
<p>I said, "You are sorry?" I had in my pocket a ten dollar bill. I said, "Take it. You are sorry."</p>
<p>She gladly took my ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>Then I continued, "Please do not do this kind of thing. You saw me, you heard me. And still you threw my water in the bin." The bin was full of such dirty, filthy things. I could see my water bottle right on the top. But how could I take it and drink it? Luckily she did not bring it out and give it to me. She did not do that. She knew that I would not take it.</p>
<p>She said to me, "I am sorry," so I gave her ten dollars and she took it very gladly. If she had not seen me, she could have thrown the water away. But she saw me not even 20 metres away. I was screaming!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The pretender</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The pretender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday I was walking at Aspiration-Ground. Then I decided to walk back to my house. It was around half past four in the afternoon. On the way, I saw a little boy coming out of his house. Very fast he ran out and then he deliberately fell down in the middle of the street. He was lying down, pretending that he had been hurt by a car and he was dying or dead.</p>
<p>I was only ten metres away from him, so I saw the whole thing. As I came closer, I saw another boy of his age come running out of the house. This boy was calling, "George, George, George! What has happened? Has anything gone wrong? Are you hurt?" He thought that some serious accident had taken place and George was severely injured. Although it was only half past four, it was quite dark.</p>
<p>When I came near the boy who was lying down, I said to the second boy, "Nothing is wrong. He is all right."</p>
<p>This little boy, George, who was lying down, looked at me and put his finger on his mouth, asking me to keep quiet. So I kept quiet. Then I saw that the boy who had followed him was still worrying. He was sincerely concerned to know what had happened and why George was not talking. He kept asking, "George, are you hurt? What happened? Was it an accident?" All kinds of things he was saying. He was terribly afraid that George had been hit by a car.</p>
<p>At last I said, "Nothing is wrong. George is only pretending."</p>
<p>Immediately George stood up, smiling, and said to me, "Mind your own business!"</p>
<p>I said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry! You are right, you are right!" What could I do? George was only five or six years old. He could not have been eight. He had to say, "Mind your own business." So I said, "Sorry, sorry, sorry."</p>
<p>I did not know what to say. That street is not properly lit. If a car had come while he was lying down pretending to be hurt, he would have been in serious trouble. And the concern that his little friend was showing was so sincere that I felt sorry for the one who came to his rescue. Alas, why did I open my big mouth?</p>

<p>This morning I went out walking. I crossed Main Street. A white car was coming towards me. I was quite safe because I was on the pavement. Then the car stopped and a man came out. He was extremely fat, at least three times as large as I am! He was holding a piece of paper and he said to me, "Do you know English?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do."</p>
<p>Then he gave me the piece of paper. He came from New Jersey and he was looking for a particular street, but I could not read the handwriting.</p>
<p>The man said, "I thought you knew English! All right, you are a wise guy!"</p>

<p>Then I was coming back. The other day I told a cute story about a white dog that lives near my 800-metre mark. Today the owner of the dog was carrying the dog into the car. I happened to be only four or five metres away. The man kept the dog on his heart chakra. When the dog saw me, he got so excited and wanted to come to me.</p>
<p>The other day also, he followed me, licking my left calf. That time the man had to come and grab him. Today the man said, "It seems that my dog has a deep attraction to you."</p>
<p>This little dog looks like Sona. He really likes me. I gave him a smile and went on my way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The meditation tip</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The meditation tip" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Yesterday around half past ten in the morning, I was coming to the tennis ground walking. I came to 150th Street and made a left turn and an immediate right turn. Then I saw two men working. One was on top of a large tree, cutting the branches, and the other was picking them up and putting them in a truck. I was trying to somehow manage to walk on the street and they were almost blocking the road. A young girl saw my predicament and gave me a smile.</p>
<p>When I drew near the two men, I said to the one who was cleaning the road, "How I wish you would come and cut down the tree in front of my house. It is quite dead. On the 23rd of September you were supposed to come."</p>
<p>The man answered, "Oh, you have to write to the authorities."</p>
<p>"I have written to them," I replied, "but they do not listen."</p>
<p>Then the man said to me, "I know you. Your picture is everywhere. I have come to quite a few of your meditation sessions at PS 86."</p>
<p>I could not recognise him at all. Then he said to me, "When I come to your meditation, I get so much peace, but it lasts only for one day. I have so many problems that the peace only lasts for one day."</p>
<p>I said, "I am glad that at least for one day your problems are solved."</p>
<p>He smiled at me and went on, "Please tell me how I can solve my daily problems."</p>
<p>I smiled at him. I was trying to move away. He said to me, "Wait! Wait! You have to give me a tip."</p>
<p>Idiot that I am, I said to him, "I am so sorry. I have no money today. I am not carrying any money."</p>
<p>He said to me, "I don't want no money." That kind of English he used. "I want you to give me a meditation tip."</p>
<p>Then he stood in front of me. I thought that by 'tip' he wanted me to give him money, but he wanted me to teach him how to meditate. He was asking me how he could make his mind calm and quiet. He was extremely sincere. I said, "All right."</p>
<p>The man up in the tree was observing us, but he did not mind at all. We were facing each other. First I asked him to breathe in very slowly and quietly. He did this very nicely and he was very, very happy. He said to me, "You are not only a great man, but you are a very good man."</p>

<p>I continued walking and came to Parsons Boulevard. There at the intersection I saw R car. She was going to the tennis ground and from there she was planning to go somewhere to do her sports. I entered into the car and came with her to the tennis ground. That was about half past ten.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Corn or blueberry muffin?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Corn or blueberry muffin?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Early this morning, at five o'clock, I walked to Queens Boulevard. As I approached the courthouse, I became very thirsty. I said to myself, "Let me finish my two miles and on the way back I will eat or drink something."</p>
<p>I went to my two-mile mark and I was coming back. After 500 or 600 metres, I saw a man standing there selling doughnuts and drinks. At least two hundred people were standing in a queue in front of the courthouse. They were very polite; there was no screaming, no riot.</p>
<p>I was more thirsty than hungry. Then hunger also attacked me. I took an apple juice. Daily I drink apple juice. Then I saw some nice doughnuts. My favourite is coconut. Inwardly I was saying, "Here I am desperately trying to lose weight. How can I think of eating a doughnut? Yesterday I took a solemn oath not to go off my diet and now another hostile temptation-attack has come!"</p>
<p>But my hunger was too strong. I surrendered. I said, "Again, there is tomorrow. I will be serious again tomorrow."</p>
<p>So I took the drink and I was about to tell the vendor to give me a doughnut when I saw at another place five or six corn muffins. An American man and I were standing practically together. He said to me, "Let me take mine first."</p>
<p>But the vendor was an Indian like me. He said to me, "Take, my Indian friend."</p>
<p>I do not know who the vendor is, but he was Indian. Then the American said, "I, too, am Indian."</p>
<p>"Says who?" asked the vendor. Then he served me first.</p>
<p>I said, "I would like to have a corn muffin." There were five corn muffins and one blueberry muffin. The vendor said, "You are asking for a corn muffin, but you are pointing to the blueberry." I looked and I saw that he was correct.</p>
<p>Then the American said, "Look, he does not know the difference between corn and blueberry muffins!" That was my experience at around seven o'clock.</p>

<p>Six black teenage girls were in front of me. They were on the other side of the street. They crossed the street and came to my side. They started walking about ten metres in front of me. Then I saw a tall, stout, black lady coming towards me, passing through them.</p>
<p>She said to me, "Sri, Sri, these are terrible people. Please do not be so close to them."</p>
<p>She was advising me and warning me. If she had said it a little louder, perhaps they would have come and attacked her. I listened to her advice and took another route.</p>

<p>Today at Sports Day I tried to walk a few laps but too much cold air has entered into my right knee. On the other side of the track, beside the long jump pit, each time I went there, I suffered. On the side where we held the sprints, there was no wind, but as soon as I went to the other side, there was so much wind!</p>
