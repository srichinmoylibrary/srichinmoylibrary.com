<p>A new year dawns. A new year, a new aspiration, a new dedication and a new realisation enter into us. Let us enter into the Supreme with a new joy, a new achievement and a new, constantly surrendering attitude. We are always fond of the new. Tomorrow, on New Year's Day, that new newness will enter into us. What can we expect from tomorrow? We expect that which we do not have right now: freedom from bondage, freedom from limitation, freedom from disease, freedom from death. Our expectation is not enough. In addition to our expectation, we must cultivate deep within us the firm determination that we shall have it, that we are bound to have all these divine qualities.</p>
<p>I always say, "The past is dust." Once again I repeat, "The past is dust." Why? The past has not given us what we have been striving for. So the past is of no use. It is the present, and the golden future which enters into the present, which make us feel what we are going to be — nay, what we truly are. We are not children of the past, but children of the glorious future.</p>
<p>There are many things that we want to do, that we want to achieve. But unfortunately we have not been able to achieve them. Why? Because our aspiration is not intense, our determination is not firm, our cry, our inner cry, is not genuine. Yet there is no end to the progress we can make, and each new year comes and stands in front of us to remind us of that very fact: that there is no end to our progress, both inner progress and outer progress.</p>
<p>How can we transcend ourselves? We can transcend ourselves the moment we feel that self-realisation or the conquest of the self is our birthright, our divine heritage. It is not that somebody has to come and thrust upon us this divine heritage.</p>
<p>We have to leave aside, cast aside, throw aside doubt, one of our greatest enemies. Doubt does not allow us to go one inch forward or one inch backward. When we want to look forward, doubt Says, "No, you are not so good." And when we want to look back, a kind of subtle doubt again tells us, "No, you cannot be so bad." Doubt never, never allows us to see the truth, to know where we actually stand. We stand right in front of God. And where are we seated? We are seated in the Lap of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Let us cry. The world needs seekers who will cry like a child for the Mother. We have forgotten how to cry. We know how to talk, how to impose truth on others, how to convince others of what we have acquired or what we have learned. From today on, let us cry from the inmost recesses of our hearts, Him to possess and Him to reveal. Without the Supreme, we do not exist. It is an unpardonable foolishness on our part when we say that we exist without Him. No, we do not exist, we can never exist even for a second without Him. If you really, sincerely, whole-heartedly care for the truth, then my fervent request to you is to go deep within and try to discover your own divinity.</p>
<p>I am here to be your eternal slave. I shall wash the very dust of your feet the moment you feel that you are prepared to cry, cry wholeheartedly for the Supreme.</p>
<p>All of us present here, all the true members of our spiritual family, must, once and for all, cast aside doubt. We must always feel that we are children of the Supreme. We are growing together, we are fulfilling the Supreme together. The Supreme is entering into us to inspire us to dive into the deepest, to fly into the highest, to run towards the farthest.</p>
<p>In the Name of the Supreme, I bless each and every one present here and all those who are in my boat, who need my help, my guidance, my assistance. It is not just for a year but forever, for Eternity. I shall be a loving, dedicated servant, a slave, to all of you who care for the Supreme and for the Supreme alone. If one says or feels that the Supreme is his or hers, then at that very moment that person can rest assured that I am here to be of immediate service to him.</p>
<p>For me there can be no greater joy, no greater pride, than to serve the seekers of truth. And this is my soul's promise to each of you on the eve of the New Year.</p>

<p>Nineteen hundred and seventy-one will be the year of divine, supreme manifestation.</p>
<p>Those who have divine obedience will offer their divine obedience to the Supreme.</p>
<p>Those who have divine love will offer their divine love to the Supreme.</p>
<p>Those who have divine devotion will offer their divine devotion to the Supreme.</p>
<p>Those who have divine surrender will offer their divine surrender to the Supreme.</p>
<p>While offering obedience, love, devotion and surrender, the seekers will manifest these divine qualities on earth.</p>
<p>Nineteen hundred and seventy-one is the year of divine manifestation.</p>
<p>Those who have only obedience can feel that they are babies.</p>
<p>Those who have love can feel that they are growing children.</p>
<p>Those who have devotion can feel that they are now at the adolescent stage.</p>
<p>And those who have surrender can feel that they are strong, stout, determined youth.</p>
<p>Now in surrender, we always say that unconditional surrender and constant surrender are needed. Unconditionally and constantly surrendered seekers are the seekers who can remain on the top of the tree; and those who have surrendered merely for a day or two or for a few minutes are at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>Others who have devotion, love and obedience are running towards the tree. Among them, obedience comes third. First comes devotion, second, love and third, obedience. Bot they are all running; they will one day reach the tree. They will stay at the foot of the tree and become surrendered, and then gradually, if it is God's Will, they will become unconditionally and constantly surrendered seekers.</p>
<p>This is the year of manifestation. For those who have faith in God-realisation, this is the year for them to expedite their inner seeking. The year of manifestation is for those who want the Supreme for the Supreme; who want the Supreme for His sake and not for their sake.</p>
<p>For our disciples, sincere disciples, this year of manifestation will be the year of inner glory in God, glory in the Supreme's highest, transcendental Pride. For the Supreme needs, as we need, many things. He needs totally, unreservedly, unconditionally and constantly surrendered disciples. It is they who will be the torch-bearers of the supreme Truth. The Supreme is inwardly crying for these constantly, unconditionally surrendered disciples.</p>

<p>The New Year is the year of battle between man's inner faith and his outer doubts. Man's sincerity will determine the victory.</p>
<p>The New Year is the year of war between human insecurity and divine confidence. Man's real need of God will determine the victory.</p>
<p>The New Year knows no compromise. Either the divine in us will gain the supreme victory or the animal in us will lord it over us. Needless to say, those who want to be God-lovers, God-discoverers and God-fulfillers will receive from God constant Concern, constant Protection, constant Guidance and constant Assurance.</p>
<p>The New Year is the year of both destruction and perfection. Those who cherish destruction in the depths of their hearts and glorify themselves in it will be embraced and devoured by total destruction. This is the Will of the Transcendental Lord decreed. Those who cry for divine illumination and perfection in their inner and outer lives will be inspired, blessed, illumined, perfected and fulfilled by the Lord Supreme's Supreme Perfection.</p>
<p>The Boat of the Supreme is ready. The Supreme Boatman is ready. The Golden Shore is ready.</p>
<p>The Boatman, with His transcendental Smile, beckons,</p>
<p>"Welcome, O God-lover! Welcome, O God-discoverer! Welcome, O God-fulfiller!"</p>

<p>The New Year is the year of our mind's inspiration, our heart's creation and our soul's manifestation.</p>
<p>Inspiration will march onward to the Source.</p>
<p>Creation will sit at the pinnacle of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Manifestation will at once prove its divinity and immortality.</p>
<p>The New Year is the year of acceptance and transformation.</p>
<p>The human in us will try to accept the divine in us unconditionally.</p>
<p>The divine in us will transform the human in us untiringly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every day will be an opportunity for the God-believer to see the truth-light.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every hour will be an opportunity for the God-worshipper to achieve the truth-light.</p>
<p>In the New Year, every second will be an opportunity for the God-lover to become the truth-light.</p>
