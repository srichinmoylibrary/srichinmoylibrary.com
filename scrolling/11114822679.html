<p>I ran about nine miles of the Boston Marathon. While I was running, I saw three Japanese women runners. The two younger ones were running with the older one for a mile or so. When they went ahead of her I said, "I am the right person to run with the older lady, since her stride is shorter than the shortest."</p>
<p>Our competition was going on very nicely. After two miles I left the course and about four or five minutes later I came back. I didn't see the older Japanese lady running. I knew she had gone quite far ahead. I ran and ran very fast and finally I saw her again and started running with her. From time to time she gave me a good smile. She was very old and very short. She was the right person for me to run with! She was drinking after practically every mile, but I didn't drink at all.</p>

<p>While I was running in Boston two young men were behind me. Then they passed me and said, "Buddy, come on."</p>
<p>One gentleman said to me, "Friend, my friend, don't give up!"</p>
<p>At one point I was breathing heavily. A little boy came up to me with a few pieces of orange. Usually I don't take oranges, but the little boy was so kind, so I took a piece of orange from him. Then he said, "Don't die, don't die!"</p>

<p>After four miles I had absolutely the funniest experience. I saw a crazy girl about seventeen or eighteen years old running. She was very tall and had on a fancy dress. She came up to me and said, "I love your gloves." After four or five steps she added, "But I love you, too." Then she left the street and entered into the crowd and started dancing. After a while she again came back and started running. Whenever she saw elderly people she would go and shake hands with them or embrace them. She was really crazy, but she had good speed.</p>

<p>Today I watched the Long Island Marathon. Many disciples were running. As soon as the marathon started, after about a quarter-mile, Gayatri came running by on the lawn. Everyone else was running on the street, but she was running on the lawn.</p>

<p>Nayana was helping Chetana. Chetana had already run thirteen miles before Nayana started running with her, but Nayana was dying to such an extent that she needed help herself. After eight hundred metres Chetana went ahead of Nayana. I told Nayana to try to catch up with Chetana and help her anyway. Nayana was very obedient. She ran and ran, but she could not catch up with Chetana — even near the finish line.</p>

<p>At one point I saw somebody wearing one of our T-shirts. "Who is over sixty years old and running on our team?" I wondered. His whole body was twisted, and I couldn't recognise him. Then I saw it was Udayan. It seemed he had no hair; he looked practically bald. He was thirty metres away from me, but because of his bald head and totally twisted body, I thought to myself, "How could this old man have our T-shirt on?"</p>

<p>Then Gary Muhrcke, the winner of the first New York Marathon, came up to me and said, "I'm sure many people are running from your club."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, many, many."</p>
<p>Then Norb Sanders came up. I didn't recognise him; he has grown a beard now. He was asking me about my knee pain.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Looking for the Ottawa Holiday Inn</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Looking for the Ottawa Holiday Inn" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Ottawa I went out to run early in the morning. I had been running for about an hour and fifteen minutes when I realised that I was lost. I asked a very nice and kind-hearted black lady where the Holiday Inn was. She said, "Oh dear, it is so far! Go straight down for at least twenty blocks and then ask people to show you where it is. You won't be able to understand how to get there from here, so after twenty blocks you ask someone where it is."</p>
<p>I ran about twenty blocks to a place that I later found out was only two or three blocks away from the hotel. Unfortunately, when I asked a young boy where the Holiday Inn was, he told me it was in exactly the opposite direction. Instead of telling me it was two blocks in one direction, he turned the other way and said, "Run that way. Go only a couple of blocks-two or three more-and then you will find it." He even pointed the way with his finger.</p>
<p>I ran two or three, then six or seven blocks and still I didn't see the hotel. Finally, I approached someone else and said, "Somebody told me that the Holiday Inn was only two blocks in this direction."</p>
<p>The man said, "Not this direction. It is in the other direction. Turn around and go the other way."</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Whom to believe?" The first time, when I was following the young boy's instructions, I was having no doubts. But by this time real doubt had started. O God, what could I do? When one is a stranger, one has to believe in these people. Finally I said, "All right." So I covered six or seven blocks in the other direction, and finally I found the Holiday Inn.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Practising what you preach</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Practising what you preach" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In Toronto there was a two-mile race. I had already run a lot early in the morning before the race, so I was very tired and exhausted. Also, I didn't have any energy because I had not been eating solid food. But I started running anyway.</p>
<p>There were about twenty-five runners in the race. Four girls who were running started to pass me. I said, "I have no more strength to run. I preach all the time 'surrender, surrender, surrender' to my disciples. Now God wants me to practise it." O God, one, two, three, four — the girls all went ahead of me. Then, after one mile, one by one I caught three of them. But one girl was still ahead of me. After a mile and a half, I had absolutely no energy left. I started walking very nicely and the girls whom I had passed went ahead. I said, "Oh, now I am practising and practising. Not only do I preach surrender but I practise it also."</p>
<p>A young man, a new disciple who still had long hair and a moustache, came up to me near the end of the race and said, "Guru, I want to run with you because I want peace. I am getting so much peace from you."</p>
<p>I thought, "Oh, he is getting peace and I am dying."</p>
<p>So, near the finish line, when I started walking, he also started walking. Then about a hundred metres from the end I told him, "Now, please, you go and run. Finish it running." So he completed the two-mile race running.</p>

<p>In Brazil there was a seven-mile or ten-mile race. I was tired, exhausted, since I had run eight or nine miles that morning, so I didn't join.</p>
<p>I saw a man with a dog near the start of the race and I said to him, "Excuse me, can you tell me how many miles they are going to run? I see there is going to be a race."</p>
<p>The man said, "I don't understand your English!" in a very abrupt way.</p>
<p>Immediately I saw that he was an American. I asked, "Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>He answered, "I come from Texas. Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>I said, "I come from New York."</p>
<p>He said, "Now I understand your English. Ask me again."</p>
<p>When I asked him, he said, "I am also a stranger, like you."</p>

<p>The other day we were riding in Databir's car after I had checked out a running route. I had five or six candies next to me that I was planning to give to the four or five people in the car. But Databir started falling asleep, so he ate all the candy to keep awake. Then, when I started looking for the candy to give to everyone, he said, "Oh, Guru, I finished it!" So the others didn't get any.</p>

I was running on the street around the track and Chandika was on the track itself. I saw her three times. I thought that secretly I was seeing her, but later she said that she had seen me.</p>
