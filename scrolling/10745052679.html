<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For an unaspiring person, the strongest divine power is God’s unconditional Compassion. For an aspiring person, the strongest divine power is the power that makes him constantly feel his inseparable oneness with the Supreme. So if one is unaspiring, God shows His infinite Compassion, and that is the strongest divine power. But if somebody is aspiring, then God shows him constant, inseparable, all-pervading, universal oneness. For him, that is the strongest power that God is showing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. If we concentrate all the time on surrender, then we are bound to get indomitable power. But this surrender has to be the divine surrender. The slave surrenders to the master under compulsion. But in divine surrender there is no compulsion. Here we surrender ourselves to our highest being out of spontaneous joy and delight. Here the finite surrenders consciously and soulfully to the infinite. The drop is the finite and the ocean is the infinite. The tiny drop, with its personality and individuality, is absolutely insignificant. But when this tiny drop enters into the mighty ocean, it becomes all-powerful. And the drop does it cheerfully, not under compulsion. So during our prayer and meditation, if we cheerfully, devotedly and soulfully offer our finite existence to the Supreme, then we are bound to get infinite Power and infinite Light. What we have and what we are is ignorance. When we offer this ignorance to light, then automatically we become all light and all power.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I invoke divine power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I invoke divine power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, it would be wise on your part to know what divine power is. If you think the divine power is something used by God at His sweet Will to punish and to destroy and to keep everyone under His control, then you are badly mistaken. Divine power is the power of light, the feeling of oneness, inseparable oneness, with God’s universe and with God. This is real divine power. And this divine power you can acquire only through constant and conscious self-offering. If you offer yourself consciously and constantly to the Inner Pilot within you, then immediately you will get divine power.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the disciple gain the power of constant remembrance and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the disciple gain the power of constant remembrance and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First let us take the power of remembrance. The power of remembrance we acquire only when we give importance to an object or a subject. When we are pinched with hunger, then we remember that there is something called food. Similarly, remembrance will come if there is real hunger. When a child is hungry, immediately he will cry to the mother for milk. His hunger is so acute; he can’t wait even for a second. So remembrance comes when we give due importance to the thing that we need.</p>
<p>Sometimes we say that we had something most important to do, but we forgot. But if we go deep within, we will see that the most important thing we have not forgotten. Only we do not pay adequate attention to it. Can there be anything more important in a spiritual person’s life than God? Can there be anything more significant, more meaningful and more fruitful than God;? No. Then how is it that we forget God? Just because we do not give adequate importance to Him. When the body is hungry, we think of food but when the soul is hungry, we do not realise it. That is because we do not identify with the soul. But if we know how to identify ourselves with the soul, which is constantly hungry for the manifestation of divine light on earth, then we shall always remember the Supreme our eternal Guru. Always we are bound to remember.</p>
<p>The other thing is unconditional surrender. Unconditional surrender we can make only when we develop the power of gratitude, only when we constantly feel the necessity of gratitude within us. Millions of people are not praying or meditating, but we are praying and meditating and trying to realise God. So each morning we have to be grateful that we are doing something that our friends and relatives are not doing. That means that there is somebody who is really kind and compassionate to us. If we can feel this, then we will see that automatically unconditional surrender will grow.</p>
<p>Many things we have tried in life but failed to accomplish. We may ask, “How Is it that we have tried so sincerely, yet we have failed?” But we have to know that what we call sincerity may not be sincerity at all. We may try to do something out of greed or personal necessity, but this may not be the necessity of God. Again, there are many things that we have achieved, but we have not paid any attention to them.</p>
<p>Unconditional surrender grows like a mushroom if, every day early in the morning, we get up to pray and meditate. Who compels us to get up? It is our inner being. We feel an inner urge to get up to meditate in the morning while our neighbours are fast asleep. So for all that we have and all that we are right now, if we can make ourselves feel that it is due to God’s conscious benevolent Will, we will feel the gratitude-flower blossoming petal by petal inside our heart. And from this gratitude-power, unconditional surrender will come.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you pray most soulfully, you have to feel that inside your soulful prayer, divine power is already there. You may say that you are invoking power for some special purpose, so you feel that the prayer itself is not the power, but you are making a mistake. Prayer is your power. And the other Power, which you can invoke from above is somebody else’s Power, it is God’s Power.</p>
<p>So, your power is prayer and God’s Power is Compassion. How can you best invoke God’s Power, which will come to you in the form of Compassion? You can best invoke God’s Power by feeling that thepower which you have is like a cent, one cent, whereas God is about to give you one hundred dollars. Again, you have to feel that the one cent which you have, the power of your prayer, has been given to you by God Himself. So if you feel that even the one cent that you have has come from above, naturally you will show gratitude. At that time, God will give one hundred dollars to you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can use your power most powerfully and most dynamically for the divine purpose only by listening constantly secretly, soulfully and unerringly to the message that you are constantly getting from deep within your heart. If you do not listen to the inner voice, then you are bound to misuse and abuse power. But if you constantly listen to the inner voice, then you will never misuse power. On the contrary, you will see that each time you use power, you will use it most effectively for the fulfilment of the Divine within humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of power: destructive power and fulfilling, illumining power. It is in destructive power that the ego plays its role. “I am superior to everybody and everybody is at my feet.” This is destructive power. But fulfilling and illumining power says, “I won’t be satisfied with myself alone, as an individual. Only the Universal Self can satisfy me.” The power that we concentrate and meditate upon in order to become universal, which is the illumining and fulfilling power, is the power of oneness.</p>
<p>When you offer the fulfilling and illumining power to mankind, you do it with the feeling that you as an individual are unsatisfied or dissatisfied with your possession. You will be satisfied only when you can claim the universe as your very own and when the universe can claim you as its own, on the strength of your mutual self-giving. By giving yourself you become one, and this oneness is founded upon sweetness, affection, sympathy, love, concern, compassion and gratitude. The oneness-tree has many branches. There you will see affection, sweetness, concern, compassion.</p>
<p>If you give me money, naturally I will be grateful to you. But if you are really spiritual, you will also be grateful to me because it is I who received from you properly and am using your gift properly. If I misuse it, then immediately the world will say, “Where did he get this power from?” Then you will also be the culprit. But if you give me something divine and I use it properly, people will first appreciate me and then they will appreciate the source. They will ask where I got it from, and then they will see you. So when we use divine power, it is not only the one who gives but also the one who receives that is important. He who gives and he who receives are of equal importance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The divine definition of power is self-giving: conscious, constant, cheerful, soulful, unconditional self-giving. Possessing is a form of power and self-giving is a form of power. Possessing is the human definition of power and self-giving is the divine definition of power.</p>
<p>What is self-giving? Self-giving is nothing other than God-becoming. If you give something divine, where does it come from? It comes from God Himself. So through self-giving we grow into the very image of God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the role of power in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the role of power in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Power is indispensable in the spiritual life. At every moment we have to energise ourselves with divine, dynamic power. If we do not have that divine, dynamic power within us, then darkness, ignorance and inconscience will all the time reign supreme. Darkness will say, “Where are you going? You have been with me for twenty years.” And ignorance will say, “Where are you going, when you have been with me for forty years?” And then, all these friends, these old friends, will come and tell us that we have no right to leave them. But if the divine power, the inner power, that we have when we accept the spiritual life comes to the fore, then we will recognise that these so-called friends are not friends. They are only binding us and not letting us go forth.</p>
<p>So in the spiritual life, power is of paramount importance, because it is the inner power that tells us that we have to act like supreme heroes, that we have to embody, reveal, manifest and fulfil the truth. So if you do not have the indomitable feeling of power within you, you will be lethargic and feel that it is impossible to escape from ignorance. Always you have to be like a divine hero and feel that your life is for building the palace of truth, and not for the destruction of truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When God shows Compassion to us, is that not power? Then He shows sympathy; this is also real power. When He shows a feeling of oneness, that too is power.</p>
<p>Power manifests itself through each individual according to his soul’s quality, true. Every soul expresses itself and manifests the Supreme through some divine quality: through light, peace, bliss and so forth. We have to know that power can be light, power can be peace, power can be compassion. Light itself is power. When we have light, then we will do everything right. Peace is power. When we have peace, then nothing affects us. These qualities can easily be seen as power, because whenever we achieve something or perform something we feel that it is due to some power.</p>
<p>In our human mind, we only recognise power in a specific form: the power that breaks or the power that builds. But the subtle power which comes when we prayerfully meditate, when our mind is calm and quiet, is peace, light and bliss. At that time, how strong and powerful we are! Here we are not struggling, nobody is striking us; but once we feel that our mind is silent, we will feel that this powerful silence itself is power.</p>

But before vital power and physical power are used, they have to be purified, illumined. Physical power as such is a blind elephant. Vital power as such is a blind elephant. Mental power as such is a monkey. They are all undivine. But if they are illumined, then these powers can and must be used most effectively.</p>
<p>Why do we give so much importance to the physical: sports and circus and all that? It is because the physical power is necessary. Physical, vital and mental power are all necessary, but only if they are being used for a divine purpose. If they are being used for an undivine purpose, then it is all a waste of life’s energy.</p>
<p>So first the physical power, the vital power and the mental power have to be transformed and illumined: then they have to offer their might, their capacity, to their eldest brother, the soul, who is already anxious that they become one. The eldest brother has much more money than the younger ones, but together they all want to buy something for the whole family. So the eldest brother gives a hundred dollars. Then the physical power comes with one dollar, the vital power with three dollars and the mental power with ten or twelve dollars. They combine their wealth and buy something for the whole family, the family of the Supreme. What is their wealth? It is their power of aspiration. This power goes up and brings down Light from above.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Any aspect of God is bound to transform one’s life. It is the seeker who has to have boundless faith in some aspect of God. It can be the Power aspect, the Peace aspect, the Love aspect, the Light aspect or any aspect. It is up to the seeker to develop faith, absolute faith, in any aspect of God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is a human being stronger than thought-power?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is a human being stronger than thought-power?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A human being is at the mercy of a tiny thought. You have two arms, two legs and so many things at your disposal. But if one tiny thought comes — anger, let us say, or insecurity — then you are finished. One little thought can weaken you to such an extent. It is smaller than an insect yet it has the power to destroy you. But much stronger than thought-power is something called will-power. Will-power has tremendous strength, dauntless power, inexhaustible power. So don’t follow thought-power; follow always will-power. An atom of will-power can illumine and fulfil your life.</p>
