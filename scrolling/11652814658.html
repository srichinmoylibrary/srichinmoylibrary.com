<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please meditate on the Supreme of each student of yours. You do not have to meditate on each student individually, but try to feel them all as one being meditating right in front of you. When you feel the presence of the Supreme inside the students, please feel that the Supreme in them is learning from the Supreme within you. You have to feel that the Supreme within you is the elder brother. If the elder brother teaches the younger ones, slowly and steadily they will get the wisdom of the elder brother. If you can feel what they are, then you will be able to see that they are part and parcel of what you are.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can best serve the Supreme in the children when you feel extremely grateful to Him for giving you the opportunity to teach children. When you teach children, you are given the opportunity to become a child yourself. You may be twenty-two or twenty-three, but your aim is to become a child, an eternal child in the spiritual life, so that you can make constant progress. If you are constantly grateful to the Supreme, and if the children remind you of your eternal childhood, then you will make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>When you teach children, do not think that the school authorities are paying you and that is why you are serving. No, you are serving the children because you want to become another child. If the children offer you a smile, feel that that smile comes from the Supreme. Each time a child smiles, it is the expansion of God’s Dream-Reality on earth. If you remember that, then you will be able to serve the Supreme most soulfully and constantly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we have a choice between using our time for our studies or for spiritual things, which should we choose?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we have a choice between using our time for our studies or for spiritual things, which should we choose?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is up to the individual soul. Some people do not want to study. I have searched their souls, and the souls do not want it. To some I have said, “You have to study.” Their souls want it. In your case, you need to devote your time and attention to spirituality. Spirituality must come first. You must have time for meditation, for selfless service.</p>
<p>For outer information you have lots of time, but for the inner life you have no time. But I wish to say that the spiritual life can easily be practised along with your outer life. Each day you can give two hours for meditation and one hour for selfless service. Everybody can give this much time. Some people will read all sorts of undivine things when their school work is over. They spend time on films, TV, comics and rubbish from the outer world instead of doing spiritual things.</p>
<p>Practising spirituality is like exercising a muscle or like learning to read. It develops with practice. It must not suffer because of your outer studies. I once had a great friend. He and his brother became disciples of a spiritual Master. The brother used to study seven to ten hours a day, and my friend would study only for two or three hours; then he would just repeat his Guru’s name. He depended on his Guru’s grace to get him through his exams. The brother once asked the Guru which was better, and he said, “It is matter of faith. You have faith in yourself and your brother has faith in my capacity to help him pass the examination.”</p>
<p>The brother who studied long hours was a fool. The day will come when the outer school life will be over, and then he will have developed only one capacity: to study. But the other brother has all along been developing two capacities: studying and meditating. In the spiritual life we do many things at a time. I do ten or eleven things at the same time. You can study for hours without learning anything, but when your mind is calm and quiet for one hour, you can do what would otherwise take you ten hours to accomplish.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I&#039;m a student. How can study and still keep God before me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I&#039;m a student. How can study and still keep God before me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy. You have to be aware of your purpose in studying. If you are studying to get a diploma, to be recognised by everyone and to make yourself feel that you are the wisest person on earth, then you will not be able to keep God before you. But if you are studying to please God, to serve God better, then with each line that you read, you must keep that idea in your mind. You have to feel all the time that there is someone watching you. While you are studying you have to feel that God is just beside you. You are a little child and your Father is watching to see whether you are studying or not. God is your eternal Father and Mother. He is always watching you invisibly.</p>
<p>Studying need not be an obstruction in the spiritual path; it can be a help. Studying demands discipline. If you want to do well in school, you have to discipline yourself. The capacity that you acquire in a few years of study you can also apply to your spiritual life. Discipline in any walk of life has to be appreciated and admired. Discipline is a divine instrument if it is applied to a divine purpose. Discipline is strength. In your student-life you have an opportunity to develop this strength which will be of great help to you in your spiritual life.</p>
<p>Study itself is a kind of service. From now on you have to take your study as a form of service to God. If you study well, if you get good marks and keep a devoted consciousness, then through your study in that particular field you are pleasing God. Today He wants you to study, and tomorrow He may ask you to do something else. In each field you have to please God in His own way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing you can teach children is the result of your own spiritual life. Just offer them the results of your own life. Your own life is the best book. If they feel in you a divine vibration, this is the best lesson they can get. You will become divine, and they will inherit your divinity. If the teacher has divinity, the children will get it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary for you to enter into outer study for your inner growth. It is only necessary for you to increase your love, devotion and surrender. To continue outer study is not necessary in most cases, but your inner study has to increase every day, every hour, every minute, every second, so that you can become a perfect instrument of the Supreme. Not just you, but everybody must increase his inner studies.</p>

<h2>Question: Matter is made up of atoms. Is spirit also made up of certain atoms?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Matter is made up of atoms, true, but inside matter spirit is there, the Supreme is there. Spirit is not made up of atoms. You can see the body, but you cannot see the soul.</p>
<p>The transcendental spirit does not act like matter. An atom can be broken into fragments, but the transcendental Spirit remains always infinite, boundless. Spirit cannot be broken into pieces. The eternal Silence of the unmanifested Spirit cannot be broken into pieces. But the sound-life can be broken into pieces because it is only the creation. Matter is the creation in which slow and steady evolution is taking place. Spirit is the Source. The Source cannot be separated or made into fragments. The Source is eternally inseparable. Only the creation can be broken into pieces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does a strong involvement with technology mitigate against our realisation of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does a strong involvement with technology mitigate against our realisation of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Technology as such does not stand against realisation, but we have to know how we deal with technology. Science, the purest science, does not negate God. But the scientist may think that the universe was created by science or that he can do without God, because with scientific research he is making the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb. Whatever he wants, he thinks he can get from science and he is satisfied with his scientific achievements. But we have to know that there is something called inner realisation, Self-realisation. For that we have to do something else. We have to do inner research, not scientific research.</p>
<p>What technology offers to the world need never stand against God-realisation. But from technology and science we cannot expect God-realisation. God-realisation is inner oneness with the highest absolute Truth. For that we have to master and go beyond the senses. We have to conquer our senses; we have to have perfect control over the senses. In this way we can transcend our limitations and attain the highest oneness with the Absolute. This oneness with the highest Absolute, technology does not aim at; and this is the problem. But if you want to see the existence of God in technology, I wish to say that it is absolutely possible. God does exist in technology. God exists in everything.</p>
<p>With technology you can have great, greater, greatest success, but that success is not the success of God-realisation. God-realisation is totally different. Neither the self-realised person nor God-realisation itself will ever stand against the achievements of science and technology. At the same time, God-realisation does not expect science and technology to stand in its way. There is no harm if you are interested in technology and science; only you have to know what you expect to get from them. If you are looking for the absolute transcendental Truth, you will not get it there. You have to go deep within yourself for God-discovery. When you have discovered yourself, you have discovered the highest Truth, and that Truth is God.</p>
<p>There is no necessary barrier between a seeker and a technologist, but one has to know what one is aspiring for. Once one has realised one’s conscious oneness with God, there is nothing else to cry for, for then one is self-sufficient. In the case of technology, one may be thoroughly conversant with it, one may get the utmost result from it, but there will still be a cry, an inner cry, for something more. That “something more” will not come from technology. What technology can offer it will certainly offer, but only God-realisation can satisfy that inner cry. In realisation there is no feeling of loss or gain. You do not feel that you have lost something or gained something, but rather that you have become something, that you are one with something.</p>

Why does she believe in spirituality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A psychiatrist can easily believe in spirituality. She comes to a spiritual person, to me, because she knows that I can convince her of the existence of the inner life. She gives joy to others, she convinces others, but she cannot convince herself. When others come to her, she interprets their dreams. She has the capacity to convince their minds. But when it is a matter of her own personal problems, she does not know how to solve them and she knows it.</p>
<p>She is sincere enough to know that it is spirituality that has the inner wisdom to solve all our problems, and that it alone can kindle our true consciousness. And for spirituality she comes to me. She knows that she will get the real answer from me. She is so sincere that she has even sent two of her clients to me. She felt that she was not in a position to help them further. I deeply appreciate her sincerity. She is well-established and well known, and she could easily have deceived herself. But just because she is sincere, she comes to me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We talk about the subconscious mind and the superconscious mind, but there are other minds also. You are also using the term “intuitive mind.” Then there are also the overmind, the supermind and Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness. In my philosophy I wish to say that we try to go beyond the mind. We try to purify and bring light into the subconscious mind. Then we try to go beyond, far beyond the human mind.</p>
<p>We all need awareness of the mind, but in my philosophy we have to go beyond awareness as well. According to my own understanding of psychology, many psychologists, especially those who follow Carl Jung’s philosophy, feel that awareness is of paramount importance. Now, the spiritual Masters also feel that awareness is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. But after being aware of something, one has to make a conscious effort to go beyond awareness, that is to say, to have conscious aspiration.</p>
<p>We have nothing to say against the psychologists, but we feel that aspiration is a much higher goal. Spiritual seekers feel that aspiration is one rung above mental awareness. Awareness is a very complicated and big word, true. But conscious aspiration is something deeper and higher than awareness.</p>
<p>Unconsciously everybody knows who God is and where God is: He is either in Heaven or on earth or somewhere else. This is our unconscious awareness. But when we enter into aspiration, we become conscious of God’s existence. At that time we can make much faster progress. How many times have I moved my hands here and there while I was talking to you? But only if I make a conscious effort will I be able to develop my arm muscles. So there has to be awareness, and also there has to be the inner urge to make progress. Awareness alone is not enough. Aspiration must come to our rescue, and we have to make a conscious effort. Aspiration is the most important thing. We start our journey with aspiration and we end our journey with realisation. Today’s aspiration is transformed into tomorrow’s realisation.</p>
<p>Many years ago I studied Freud and Jung, and last year I studied an authority on Jung’s philosophy and psychology. There I found that they have come to the conclusion that awareness is all; they do not go any farther. I agree that awareness is of immense help to an ordinary human being. But spiritual seekers have to go beyond awareness. We have to make a conscious effort; and that conscious effort we call aspiration, inner aspiration. Otherwise, even if we are aware of the truth, the truth will not be of any use to us. I have got a body, true. But if I do not consciously try to improve it, then it will not make any progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He should view science as an opportunity to manifest his realisations. The student should not view science as only microbes. He must feel that in the laboratory he is dealing with aspiring life, with growing, changing consciousness.</p>
<p>When he is studying or conducting an experiment, he should feel that he is fulfilling his realisations from his spiritual life, that he is bringing down his meditation into the world itself. Through meditation we go high, higher, highest to discover the reality, Through science we manifest and spread the reality all over the world. In meditation we see the truth; in science we fulfil the truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world everybody has a profession or vocation of his own. But an anthropologist also has to become a seeker if he wants to know anything about the soul. When he seeks light, truth and bliss, naturally he is bound to get them. No matter which profession he follows, when he becomes a seeker, he will be able to feel the presence of the soul and see the soul. Then he will be able to execute the will of the soul, even in his profession.</p>
<p>He has become an anthropologist because he studied that subject. Similarly, if he prays and meditates, he will also get the result of his inner study. An anthropologist he has become by studying something in the outer life. A seeker he will become if he practices something in the inner life. When he gets peace, light and bliss in abundant measure, he will easily be able to come into contact with the soul. Then he can do anything. With the light of the soul he can fulfil all his dreams in the field of anthropology.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Creation is continuous. There is evolution, but it is in the soul; it is the evolution of the soul in matter. The soul starts its journey in the Silence-world. While it is evolving, in each incarnation the soul receives light. As long as there is continuous creation in a human incarnation, the body can stay on earth. When creation stops, after seventy or eighty years, then the body dies. What remains is the eternal soul. The soul is evolving through mineral, plant, animal and human life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why should there be links? If you live in one house and then go to live in some other house, it does not mean that both the houses have to have some physical connection. Today you can pass through New York or Connecticut because they are right next to each other. But if you want to visit another state, it doesn’t have to be adjacent to either of them. Creation is separate from the soul’s evolution. While you are in this house, you are evolving; while in another house you are also evolving. The soul can take one incarnation as a bird and another incarnation as a lion. But that does not mean that birds and lions have any link.</p>
