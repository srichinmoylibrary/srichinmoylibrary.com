<p>The lady who owned the meeting place that we used in Berlin came up to me after one meeting. She told me that I am a great man and that she was so grateful that I had come to her place.</p>
<p>She said, "You are an artist and I am an artist. You are a greater artist, but I would like to give you this painting of mine. I am giving it to the artist in you and not to the spiritual Master."</p>
<p>I said, "It is very beautiful."</p>
<p>She was so thrilled.</p>

<p>We had a nice trip to Finland and Sweden, where I gave Peace Concerts. In both places we also inaugurated Peace Miles. Helsinki had a beautiful course, and Uppsala also was very good.</p>
<p>Just ten or twelve disciples worked on the Peace Miles, but they got 500 or 600 people to run. In their case it was not manpower or money-power but heart-power that succeeded.</p>

<p>Always I have experiences with children on planes! When I was flying to California for our Peace Concert, one little boy was bothering me like anything on the plane. He was absolutely jumping and jumping, and two times he fell on me. I was so afraid he would get hurt.</p>
<p>His mother tried to take off his shoes, but he didn't want to take them off. Then so many times he kicked me!</p>
<p>What can you do?</p>

<p>On the plane coming back from San Francisco, there was a very mischievous child sitting next to me. His mother was sitting on his other side.</p>
<p>He started playing with clay and throwing it around. Some of the clay landed on my pants.</p>
<p>I said to his mother, "He will be an artist."</p>
<p>The mother said, "How do you know?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am an artist."</p>
<p>Then I went to sleep. Otherwise, I would have had to enter into conversation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Different Consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Different Consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At our hotel in Vina del Mar, Chile, I was on the seventh floor waiting for the elevator. Also waiting for the elevator was a man who was absolutely ferocious and very drunk. Then a lady came up to him who also had a very bad consciousness. It was not just that they were drunk, but if you entered into their consciousness, you saw they were like animals. They had a beast-like consciousness; at any moment they might strangle you. So I pretended that I had forgotten something and went away.</p>
<p>A minute or so later I came back. This time a very civilised, elderly American couple was waiting for the elevator. They were talking about the wife's shoes. No matter what she wears, nothing fits her. The husband said that he was willing to go to the shoe store with her, but the next day was Sunday.</p>
<p>So this change happened in a matter of one minute. It is better not to get on an elevator with people like that first couple. And if somebody very undivine comes into the elevator when you are in it, just get out. If the person has time to come in, you also have time to get out.</p>

<p>Of all the places we visited in South America, the best was Valdivia! I got such joy there, although the people there were very poor.</p>
<p>In Vina del Mar the hotel people were very nice, but in Valdivia I got a very good feeling from the people in the town itself.</p>

<p>In Lima, Peru, I left my bag in the car with Savyasachi. I had all my money in the bag, as well as my passport. Because the car door was a little open, the bag was almost stolen.</p>
<p>One person came up to Savyasachi's window and tried to distract him by showing him some keys and asking if they were his. Meanwhile, two other people opened the door on the other side and tried to take the bag. Fortunately, Savyasachi had tied the bag to the stick shift, so they couldn't take it.</p>
<p>Now we can laugh about it, but if they had taken it, we would have cried!</p>

<p>Four reporters came to interview me in Lima. One of them was 100 per cent my disciple. She had a soul's connection with three or four disciples, and she was looking at me as if she had known me for a long time. Then she took the chair right near me.</p>
<p>She asked me a question in Spanish and I answered her in English. She was so surprised that I had understood her Spanish.</p>
<p>Then Agraha asked her something. Afterwards, he said he couldn't believe how kind she was.</p>
<p>All the reporters were so nice. Usually you talk for ten minutes and the reporters write down two words. But these reporters were writing continuously.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Showing Off On The Calf Raise Machine</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Showing Off On The Calf Raise Machine" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Last night after the Stuttgart Peace Concert, a famous German bodybuilder came up to talk to me. His name is Jusup Wilkosz. Many times I had seen videos of him competing with Frank Zane and others, but I had never met him. He was Mr. Universe in 1980. He also got third place in the Mr. Olympia contest behind Lee Haney and somebody else.</p>
<p>This morning I went to visit his gym. I have never seen a gymnasium as beautiful or as well-kept. Other gymnasiums are usually so dirty, but his was very clean — like a temple.</p>
<p>He had every kind of modern apparatus, including a calf raise machine. The maximum weight it takes is 860 pounds, but they usually use between 400 and 600 pounds. They never try even 700 pounds.</p>
<p>I wanted to show off. So without warming up, I said, "Let me do 400 pounds." Then I did 600 pounds and finally I did 860 pounds.</p>
<p>Wlikosz couldn't believe that I did it. He knew that I had done a 2,000-pound calf raise, but when he saw me do the maximum of 860 pounds on his machine, he couldn't believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Nowadays, with my left leg I can do 1,200 pounds and with my right leg I can do 800 or 1,000 pounds. In spite of that I can't walk properly. When I told him that, he advised me not to eat meat. He eats meat once a week, but he was advising me not to eat meat at all.</p>

<p>While Databir was driving me to an Indian store the other day, he was playing a musical tape. For about two minutes I listened to the music and inwardly I was so moved. I said to myself, "How I wish I could play like that!"</p>
<p>Then I asked Databir, "Do you know the name of the person who is playing?" I was being sincere. There was no mischief behind my question.</p>
<p>Databir said, "Guru, it's your synthesizer tape."</p>
<p>I had never dreamed that I was the one playing. It was far beyond my remotest imagination. I didn't even recognise the instrument!</p>
<p>For another ten minutes I soulfully and devotedly listened to the tape with genuine admiration and rapt attention.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was giving a concert in Canada. About 500 or 700 people were in the audience. As I came off the stage, somebody came from behind me and fell at my feet. immediately I recognised Chander, who had been one of my sectional bosses when I worked at the Indian Consulate in New York.</p>
<p>I said, "O God, you are my boss!"</p>
<p>He said, "Inwardly I am not your boss!" He had felt something in me and had seen me in another consciousness.</p>

<p>I said, "Is it a crime if you can't remember your number?"</p>
<p>She asked me where I wanted to call and I said, "Queens". She couldn't understand my pronunciation, so I said, "It is the feminine of king."</p>
<p>So I was teaching her vocabulary and she was teaching me pronunciation.</p>
