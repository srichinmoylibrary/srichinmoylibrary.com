<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can please the United Nations soul by imagining that right in front of you is a huge tree. Imagine that you are looking at all the branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. Cast a glance at each part of the tree and feel that everything that the tree has is for humanity's success and humanity's progress. A tree is constantly offering itself for the betterment of mankind. If you can think of the United Nations as a tree and if you can devotedly observe all the good qualities of the tree, you will be able to increase the good qualities of the United Nations plus your own good qualities. This is how you can please the United Nations soul. If someone appreciates their children, parents become very happy. In exactly the same way, if you can appreciate the life-tree of the United Nations, then you are pleasing the inner resident, the soul of the United Nations.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can disciples make correct decisions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can disciples make correct decisions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to make the correct decision, you have to meditate most soulfully for at least ten minutes. During this time, you must not have any thought — good or bad. The mind has to be completely empty. After meditating for about ten minutes, you will bring tremendous will-power from the third eye and focus it on the heart. Then you will try to uncover your heart chakra. If you feel that there is something covering the heart chakra like a lid, you will just uncover it. Once you uncover the heart chakra, you will receive a whisper. That whisper will come either in the form of light or in your own language. It will not form a sentence — only one word. The light will be connected with your vision-eye, and the connection will be there inside the heart. There we do not form sentences. But from that one syllable or one word you will be able to correctly get the message and that will be your final and infallible decision. Absolutely do not allow your mind to tell you what to do or what not to do. You have to use only the light that is connected with your vision-eye, which you will experience inside your heart centre.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: For a disciple of yours, is two hours of meditation per day too much?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: For a disciple of yours, is two hours of meditation per day too much?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your Guru used to meditate for a minimum of eight or nine hours a day, sometimes even eleven or twelve hours. Either seated on my bed from two o'clock in the morning under the mosquito net or on the roof or while cycling I used to meditate. So I feel that two hours is not too much for any disciple unless that disciple has joined the path only a few months ago. If you have been on the path for seven years or more, two hours is not too much. On the contrary, two hours is too little! But because of the hustle and bustle of life in the West, you may not get two hours at a time. In that case you can meditate for half an hour four times during the day or you can meditate two times a day for one hour. I feel that it is not too much. But this meditation has to be real meditation. While meditating if you are allowing the whole world to enter into you, or if you are entering into the whole world, then this is no meditation.</p>
<p>Again, there are two ways of approaching meditation. One way is to feel that if we can meditate for five minutes most soulfully, then it is infinitely better than meditating for five hours and allowing the whole world to enter into us. But some people cannot meditate for five minutes with utmost intensity. In that case, what will they do? They will act like fishermen who spend quite a few hours with the hope that they may catch some fish. If powerful meditation is not at your command, then spend half an hour in order to meditate five or seven minutes properly. During that half hour, God will definitely bless you. Thoughts will be coming, this and that. Then all of a sudden, you will be very strict with yourself. You will say, "Now I do not want those thoughts," and then you will easily be able to meditate for five minutes. But if you know that at any time you can meditate and reach your highest, then do it, for five minutes or ten minutes or however long you wish.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When is laughter spiritual?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When is laughter spiritual?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are laughing at yourself for the stupidity that you have shown in the past, then definitely it is spiritual. If you are responsible for your own stupidity and if you very powerfully laugh at yourself and say, "I am not going to make that mistake any more!" then it can help you in your spiritual life. Otherwise, when you laugh at others and say that it is innocent, you only hurt others and yourself.</p>
<p>By laughing at others' stupidity to your heart's content, you may or may not get rid of your own mental headache, but you are definitely hurting others. Even when you say it is innocent laughter, others do feel it — some part of their being is hurt. You may feel that it is insignificant, that you are enjoying harmless laughter, but the other person does get hurt.</p>
<p>If you wish to take laughter as spiritual, then apply it to yourself and your own stupidity: "How could it be possible for me to make such silly mistakes?" If you laugh at your own stupid mistakes so that you do not want to repeat them, then definitely laughter can become part of your spiritual awakening and spiritual fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What makes one truly beautiful outwardly?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What makes one truly beautiful outwardly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to see true beauty in your outer life, then it has to come from your pure life. Your purity-heart will be reflected in the beauty of your face, of your eyes and of your entire being. When you can bring to the fore your purity-heart, then you are bound to see real beauty in your face, in your eyes, in your hair, everywhere. Bringing forward a purity-heart is the only way for a seeker to make his or her outer existence beautiful. When purity comes forward, you will see a totally different aura around that person.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went into a music shop. The man was looking at me and looking at me. Finally he said, "How beautiful you are! I am seeing your aura." In no way was he flattering me so that I would buy his musical instruments. He was seeing one of my auras. With such sincerity he was looking at me and admiring my aura. So here is the proof. The revelation of my purity-heart he saw in my outer face.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will ignorance ever leave me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will ignorance ever leave me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If ignorance does not leave you, then God will be a true failure, and God can never accept failure. Once we accept the spiritual life, it becomes God's problem to make us perfect. True, if we ourselves try to become perfect, it helps God to expedite our progress. Otherwise, once we accept the spiritual life, no matter how slowly we walk, even if we crawl along the path, God will always be there for us.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bound to leave you, to leave me, to leave everybody because God is there for us. The life of ignorance can never be permanent. That is for sure. No matter what kind of disciple we are, God has infinite Patience for us. With His infinite Patience, He will definitely lead us to our destination. But if we co-operate with Him, if we listen to Him devotedly, then our ignorance-life comes to an end much sooner.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do a soul&#039;s qualities remain throughout Eternity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do a soul&#039;s qualities remain throughout Eternity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, a soul's qualities remain throughout Eternity. Again, they increase. Sometimes in one incarnation the good qualities of a particular soul may not be manifested as much as they are in other incarnations. That does not mean that those qualities do not exist. It is just that it is not necessary for them to come forward at that point in the soul's evolution.</p>
<p>Suppose in this incarnation I aspire to be a great violinist. In my next incarnation I may not care for the violin at all. But the excellence that I acquired from studying the violin is still there in my soul, although my soul may not want to manifest that particular quality any more. My soul may want me to be an engineer or to do something else. But the good qualities the soul always keeps.</p>
<p>At the same time, the determination or the discipline that I needed in order to become a great violinist will also remain with me. In this lifetime if I want to enter another field and become a great athlete or something else, then if I can bring forward that discipline once more, it will definitely help.</p>
<p>Any good quality that the soul has acquired over the years through patience, perseverance and discipline, the soul will never lose. But the soul may not want to utilise all the good qualities that it has in a particular incarnation. The soul comes down to manifest particular good qualities in order to expedite God's manifestation on earth. Only the good qualities that are needed in a particular incarnation will be chosen by God to be manifested.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be perfectly sincere, there are only two or three more individuals whom I want to lift. I am only waiting for those two or three individuals. I am not going to lift one hundred, two hundred or three hundred more people — far from it. But inwardly, definitely, definitely, as long as I live, until I breathe my last, even in the soul's world, I will continue to lift human beings. That I will never stop. As long as God keeps my connection with Him intact, no matter where I am — in Heaven or somewhere else — I will definitely lift up the consciousness of humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The inner beauty of Hawaii has not surrendered to the outer opulence and outer grandeur of America. Outwardly Hawaii is a state. Therefore all the good qualities and bad qualities of the other states have entered into Hawaii. At the same time, Hawaii's own good qualities are drawing tourists from all over the world. But there is a very subtle, delicate, inspiring and aspiring beauty which Hawaii has. This divine beauty Hawaii has not surrendered to America or any other state. As soon as you enter into the soul of Hawaii, you see that this pristine beauty, serenity and many other divine qualities are untouched. They have not been destroyed by the rest of America or by any other part of the world.</p>

<h2>Question: Are you a Hindu?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I happened to take birth in a Hindu family, but because I am a truth-seeker and a God-lover, I feel that there is only one religion and that religion is love of God. If we truly love God, we embrace all religions as our own, very own.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our prayer should be very simple, soulful and self-giving. For all the citizens of the world, for all my brothers and sisters of the world, I wish to offer this simple prayer:</p>

<p>"O Lord Supreme,<br /> May we say the right thing,<br /> May we do the right thing,<br /> And may we become the right person."</p>

<p>The right thing to say: "We love You, God."</p>
<p>The right thing to do: serve God.</p>
<p>The right thing to become: God's perfect children, who do not quarrel, who do not hate anybody and who do not wage war.</p>
<p>We want to love God in our inner life of prayer. We want to serve God in our outer life of action. We want to please God and we want to be true members of His universal family.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1003-1011. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Bali, Indonesia, on 15 January 1991.</p>
<h2>Question: Is there a question we can ask ourselves to see if we are keeping our motives pure, so that when we are doing something, we are doing it for the right purpose and not for the ego?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whenever we do something, we look around to see if others are watching. If we are successful, we look to see if they are appreciating us. And if we have failed badly, we look to see if anyone has seen it. Even if it is for God that we are doing something, a kind of pride may come in. But whenever you are doing something, if you have tremendous gratitude inside your heart, sincere gratitude inside your heart, then that gratitude will bring purity into the entire being. Then there can be no problem.</p>
<p>You have to feel that God gave you the capacity to start, God gave you the capacity to continue, and God gave you the capacity to complete whatever you are doing. Therefore you are so grateful. At every moment, from the beginning to the end, if you can feel the presence of gratitude inside your heart, then the ego does not come into the picture. The ego and gratitude do not go together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Grace is universal. Like rain, everybody can receive it. Compassion is like a magnet which is pointed at only some individuals. Compassion is more intense than Grace. That is why I use the term Compassion much more in our philosophy. In the case of true spiritual seekers, Compassion is much more important.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I feel lost about how to offer love to God. It seems that unless God enters into you, you do not have love to give.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I feel lost about how to offer love to God. It seems that unless God enters into you, you do not have love to give." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you start thinking about how to love God, you will never be able to do it. It has to be spontaneous. When you enter into a garden, you do not have to think about how you can appreciate the beautiful flowers. Immediately the vibration of the garden will come and enter into you. Immediately you will smell the fragrance and see the beauty. In the same way, we love God not by thinking, but by feeling. Feel that you have opened your heart-door. When you open up the garden gate, you do not have to run to a particular flower. Immediately you get the purity and fragrance of the flowers. Your heart is not just a tiny muscle. It is also a garden. Once you enter your heart-garden, then definitely you will be able to see the Gardener, our Lord Supreme. You can start by imagining your heart-garden. Imagination is a world of its own. It is completely different from thinking. Thinking is constant contradiction. But when you imagine something very beautiful and soulful, it has tremendous reality, tremendous truth in it. To come back to your question, do not think of how to love. Just love. Love is already there inside your heart-garden.</p>
