  <h2 id="page-title">Question: On our birthday, is it better to mix with people or try to be by ourselves?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: On our birthday, is it better to mix with people or try to be by ourselves?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to divide your time. You have to receive first; then you have to give. Early in the morning you have to pray and meditate and get Blessings from Above, from our Lord Beloved Supreme. His Blessings, His Love, His Compassion, His Concern, His Joy — everything that you need — you will pray to the Supreme to grant you. Once you have received these things, you will be happy. Then this happiness you have to share with others. If you do not receive before you start mixing with your friends, you will not get God’s special Blessings. Usually your friends do not meditate for you on your birthday. They send their good will, but they do not seriously pray to the Supreme for even one minute to grant you His Blessings, His Love, His Compassion, His Peace. They will only mix with you in a social way. They will try to inspire you, but it is you who have to receive the spiritual things, the inner things, the most important things, from your prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>A birthday is a day of joy and happiness. It is the day of the soul’s promise to the earth-consciousness or your own body, vital and mind. It is a mutual promise. Your soul has promised God that it will manifest God’s Light in and through your body, vital, mind and heart. Again, your heart, your mind, your vital and your body have promised to become perfect instruments to please your soul or to please God in His own Way.</p>
<p>Once you have played your role, once you have prayed and meditated early in the morning and received inner wealth, then during the day you will be able to share your inner and outer joy with your friends. Otherwise, if you do not get these divine things before you start mixing with people, your promise to your soul or to God and your soul’s promise to you will never be fulfilled. First things first: first comes your inner life and then you will talk with your friends, have a party and do other things. First comes your promise to the Supreme and the Supreme’s Promise to you. Then, once you feel that you have received from Above the things that you need, you can mix with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Again, you can meditate not only once, but several times. Suppose in the morning you have meditated and you have received something and you are very happy. Then you can go to work or mix with people. After two or three hours, again you can meditate. On your birthday at least three or four times you can be in absolute silence. Let us say in the morning you have earned ten thousand dollars’ worth of inner wealth. Then, when you are talking with your friends, you may offer them one hundred or two hundred dollars’ worth. As you have a pocket in your garment, in your heart-pocket you can deposit inner wealth when you meditate.</p>
<p>On your birthday, if you can meditate three or four times, it will be good. In the morning you have to start with utmost gratitude because you are following the spiritual life. You know people who have not accepted the spiritual life, your friends, your colleagues, your classmates and others. Only once look around in your mind and say, “O God, I am so grateful to You that I am not like him, I am not like her. Out of Your infinite Compassion, You made me a seeker, a spiritual person. Otherwise I would have been like him or her.” Then again in the evening or at night, before you go to sleep, just pray, “My Supreme, I am so grateful to You that You have kept me in a high consciousness throughout the entire day. Again and again I was able to think of You, to think of the promise that I have made to You and to be worthy of the promise that You have made to me.”</p>
<p>This is how you have to utilise your day — by balancing the inner and the outer life. If you remain only in the inner world, you will neglect your friends. That will not be at all good because you have come into the world to be one with them, to be part and parcel of God the creation. You have to manifest God inside your friends and your dear ones on earth. The same thing they are also going to do. They are going to manifest God’s Light in you and around the world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When my birthday is approaching, it gives me an incentive to be spiritual so that on that day I will be able to please God. But then a few months after my birthday I lose my incentive.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When my birthday is approaching, it gives me an incentive to be spiritual so that on that day I will be able to please God. But then a few months after my birthday I lose my incentive." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody does! You are not the only culprit. Human beings are all sailing in the same boat!</p>
<p>If you think of your birthday not only as a day of joy, but also as a day of promise, then you will see that you have not fulfilled your promise to God. Your promise to God is to be a perfect instrument of His so that You can please Him always in His own Way. Today you are seeing that you have so many imperfections. Tomorrow again you will see that you have so many imperfections. The day after tomorrow, the same thing. But again, your aspiration is to become a most perfect instrument.</p>
<p>If you can keep this aspiration as a burning reality, you will eventually achieve your goal. Your goal is to climb up the spiritual Himalayas. You may say, “The Himalayas are so high, so tall, and I have only just started. What am I doing?” If you maintain your goal, you will go up, up, up. But if you do not want to see your goal because after two days you are tired, then you will be assailed by doubts. You will say, “It is so high! The best thing is to go down.” Or you may say, “Oh, I have climbed up a few feet. Now let me take rest.” But in the spiritual life, there is no such thing as rest. If you are not looking up, then you will look down. At that time you will see that there are so many people at the foot of the Himalayas. They are lying down, sleeping and snoring. You will say, “Oh God, they are most comfortable. Let me go down and join them.” Then you go down, and where is your goal? You climbed up before your birthday, and for a few days after your birthday you kept going up and up. Then afterwards relaxation started and brought you down. Now God alone knows when you will get up and make a new beginning.</p>
<p>If you take your birthday as the continuation of your promise to God to become His most perfect instrument, then today you will see that you have not fulfilled your promise, and tomorrow you will see the same thing. But, as you go on and on, you will see that there are quite a few good qualities which you are getting and quite a few bad qualities that have gone away from you. So that is a great satisfaction. Ten years ago, perhaps you had twenty desires. Now, since you are praying and meditating every day, you may see that you have brought it down to six desires or five desires. Here you are seeing your progress. This progress is your satisfaction, your perfection. In our philosophy, progress is always perfection. I will achieve perfect perfection when I have no desires, but the fact is that yesterday I had ten desires and today I have only four desires. Tomorrow I will have three desires. So that progress is perfection.</p>
<p>Absolute perfection is when you do not have even one desire. But there is something beyond this. You have extinguished all your desires, true, but do you have aspiration? God will catch us in that way. You may say, “I do not want this; I do not want that.” But then God will ask you, “What do you want? Do you want Me all the time, in My own Way? You do not want to have a car, you do not want to have material wealth, you do not want to fly all over the world, you do not want to have houses and so on. Yes, I appreciate this, but then in a positive way, have you cried for My Love, for My Blessings, for My Compassion?” According to you, you are perfect because you do not have any desire, but according to God you are not perfect because you are not asking for His Peace, for His Love, for His Joy, for the increase of your own aspiration.</p>
<p>What we call progress is definitely perfection in its own way. But as there is no end to our progress, even so, there is no end to our perfection. That is why we continue and continue and continue. Every day you have to think of your progress. Then you will see that there is no end to your progress. Otherwise, if we do not look at our progress, we will not be able to continue our life-journey. For five days before our birthday we shall work very hard, again for another five days after our birthday we will aspire most intensely, and then it is over. But no, our birthday is every day. Since each birthday gives us joy and determination and reminds us of our promise, then let us keep that birthday every day to maintain the same promise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does the soul consider when it chooses a particular day and a particular month to be born on earth?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does the soul consider when it chooses a particular day and a particular month to be born on earth?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not only the soul that chooses a particular day. It is like a conference. The Supreme and the higher beings will also help to select the day. As in a big conference there will be a chairman, a president and so on, in exactly the same way the decision is made in Heaven. Together they select the date.</p>
<p>When the soul accepts the body, vital, mind and heart, the soul becomes the captain and the Commander is the Supreme. The captain depends on the ordinary soldiers — the body, vital, mind and heart. The soul makes a promise to the Supreme that it will guide the members of its family to Him. Each member also makes a promise to the higher worlds. The soul wants constant obedience from these members. If they do not listen, problems arise. Then God-manifestation becomes almost impossible.</p>
<p>Let us say you run an office. You have appointed some workers, and they promise you that they will listen to you and be good workers. After a few days or a few months, some of them remain good workers while others enter into relaxation and become very bad. Then a day may come when everybody is relaxed, even the good workers.</p>
<p>Similarly, there may come a time when even the heart, who is dearest to the soul, does not listen to the soul. The soul made a promise to God that these members will run effectively, most satisfactorily. The body promised to be awakened, but instead the body wants to sleep. The vital promised to be dynamic, but instead it becomes aggressive. The mind promised that it would have one-pointed will, but instead the mind starts doubting everything. The heart promised it would maintain its oneness with others all the time. Instead of that it enters into the vital and is enjoying all the weaknesses of the vital. It does not want to enjoy the pristine purity and divinity of the soul.</p>
<p>The heart is supposed to stay in one room, where it is all safety. There everything is soulful in a divine way. Instead of that, the heart enjoys being one with the vital. Then emotional vital problems start. Oneness-love, oneness-fulfilment, universal oneness — that kind of divine love goes away. Then the love that the heart has goes to only one person or one thing. The heart starts loving only its body, its vital, its mind or one thing or one person, whereas the heart was meant to be universal. Here the heart is limiting itself and making itself insecure. If the heart establishes its oneness, constant oneness, with the soul, with God, then it becomes the universal heart. Instead of that, the heart starts limiting itself and binding itself. One by one, all the members of the soul’s family fail in their promise.</p>
<p>When God created the soul and the body, vital, mind and heart, it was God’s Vision that all of them would work together perfectly. They started well, they meant well, but one by one they became disobedient or treacherous or useless. They did not want to deliberately disobey, but they have not used their capacity properly, so now they have become useless. Then what does God do? God says, “All right, in this incarnation you have failed. Next incarnation again you will start.” God is dealing with Eternity, but if you as an individual can become an excellent instrument in this lifetime, then God will have more faith in you and God will give you more responsibility. He will prepare something infinitely greater for you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you want to offer your best wishes to a friend who lives far away and then through negligence you miss their birthday, is it too late afterwards, or can you make up for it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you want to offer your best wishes to a friend who lives far away and then through negligence you miss their birthday, is it too late afterwards, or can you make up for it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Better late than never. Your friends will forgive you, because they know that these things happen. It is not something uncommon. But if you have a very strong inner connection with that person, it will be difficult for you to forgive yourself.</p>
<p>Many times it happens that we can forgive others, but we cannot forgive ourselves because we expect something infinitely more beautiful, more soulful, more powerful from ourselves. Ordinary, unaspiring people forgive themselves. Then as soon as they see the same fault in somebody else, they can never forgive that person. But when good people see an iota of imperfection in themselves, they get so mad at themselves. When bad people see a little imperfection in others, they try to make it larger than the largest. That is the difference between a good person and a bad person. A good person will try to forgive or ignore the other person’s faults. He will say, “Poor fellow! I also have imperfections.” A bad person always tries to hide his own imperfections. He tries to only look at the imperfections of others. A good person looks at his own little imperfection and says, “If I have this imperfection, how am I going to become God’s dearest, most perfect instrument?” He does not want to forgive himself. He wants to perfect himself at every moment.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, if you do not offer your good wishes to your friends, if you are a good person, you will suffer infinitely more than the person who has not received the card from you. For this reason you have to be always very careful. If you have already made the mistake, then call the person or write to the person and apologise profusely. If there is sincerity in your heart, it will definitely touch their heart.</p>
<p>Sometimes people deliberately do not call their friends or dear ones, and afterwards they say that they forgot their birthday. Or they may tell a lie: “I phoned you, but you were not there.” Sometimes they will say, “I sent you a card, but the post office must have lost it.” They make the post office the culprit. Bad people will mail the card the same day or ten days later and blame the post office. They will say that somewhere in the post office it got stuck. Always bad people will make a third party responsible. When it comes to good people, even if a third party is responsible, they will take the blame themselves: “Perhaps I did not put enough stamps” or “Perhaps I forgot to mail it.”</p>
<p>Your inner sincerity is the most important thing. First of all, if your connection with that person is very deep, you will not forget. But if you have forgotten, then apologise. If it comes from the very depths of your heart, from your inner being, the other person will feel that it was a deplorable mistake and in no way did you want to ignore them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Congratulations! You have won. You had some hurdles and you jumped over the hurdles. You had negative attacks and your soul won. I am very proud of you. Now, what is your question?</p>
<p>Question: My question is, was God trying to tell me something?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only to take life seriously. Seriously means to be a supremely chosen instrument of God. This always you have to remember. We are all God’s instruments. But in a class there may be fifty students. One is at the bottom of the class and others are first, second, third. If I am studying in that class, my goal is not just to be in the class, but to be first. Some students say, “As long as I am in the class, it is enough.” My disciples do exactly the same. Some of them say, “As long as I am on the path, as long as I am in the boat, I can sleep, I can snore, I can relax.” Who needs that kind of passenger? The Pilot wants people who are awake, alert and looking all around. He wants passengers who are singing, chanting and doing all kinds of things. The Boatman is steering the Boat towards the Destination and they are inspiring the Boatman. These are the good disciples.</p>
<p>Always think of doing something and becoming something. When I say doing something, I do not mean by hook or by crook, but on the strength of your aspiration, dedication and surrender to God’s Will. Do everything with your heart’s inner cry and with your life’s outer dedication. Then you will have no time to look at the negative forces. If you always look at the north, how can you look at the south? Your goal is not behind you. Your goal is ahead of you. It is right in front of you, in front of your nose. So if you are always aiming at the positive side of life, then the negative side will automatically drop off because it no longer exists for you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it easier to hear the soul’s voice on our birthday than on other days?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it easier to hear the soul’s voice on our birthday than on other days?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your meditation. On your birthday if you are thinking of how many gifts you are going to get from your friends or how many people are sending you telegrams or letters, and if during your meditation all those thoughts are coming, then will you be receptive? God will give you zero. The day itself is good, but on that day hostile forces can attack you very nicely: “Did he congratulate me? Who will give me a cake today? Let me examine whether so-and-so is my real friend or not. If she does not give me a cake, then our friendship is finished!”</p>
<p>On your birthday you are meditating to get special Blessings, but every day you have to meditate with utmost sincerity. Then you create the receptivity. It is like a muscle — every day you have to practise. Overnight can you become a wonderful singer? No. Only by practising and practising. So if you meditate every day soulfully and devotedly, then you will be receptive on your birthday. Otherwise, during the entire year you will think of your breakfast, what you ate last night, what others are doing or what kind of dress you are going to wear today — this kind of nonsense you will think about during your meditation. At that time, meditation is not in your mind; in your mind is the rest of the world. Then how are you going to be receptive? Throughout the year if you meditate sin cerely, then on your birthday, your special day, you can receive, because on that day you will be more careful in your prayer. You will be more alert. Then automatically you will become more receptive.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule that on your birthday you will have a better meditation. True, on your birthday, the Person who is going to give you Blessings will be kinder, more affectionate and more compassionate to you, but you have to open your heart’s door. On other days, if He comes to you, because of your lack of receptivity you will get perhaps ten dollars’ worth of spirituality. But on your birthday, out of His infinite Compassion, He is bringing one hundred or two hundred dollars’ worth of spirituality. Just because it is your birthday, He may stand outside your heart-door a few minutes more. On regular days, He may stand for five seconds. During these five seconds, He knocks and knocks at your heart-door. If you do not open the door in those five seconds, He goes away. On your birthday, after He has knocked at the door, He may stay there for five minutes. After five minutes, if you are not opening the door, He will go away. It is enough. So on your birthday, you are getting more opportunity, but you cannot say that on that day you are going to be receptive. God is always ready to see whether you are going to open the door. But it is up to you. You can keep the door bolted from inside. If you do not open the door, He is not going to break it open. He is coming as your guest to give you something. If you do not open the door, what can He do?</p>
<p>We have to create receptivity by praying every day sincerely. If you want to depend on one particular day, your birthday, you will be totally lost. A good farmer ploughs the field every day. A bad farmer will wait for the particular day when there will be rain and everything else at his disposal, while the good one will go on, come rain, come sun, ploughing faithfully.</p>
<p>Similarly, good students will study every day. Bad students, the night before the examination, will drink coffee and give themselves a headache by trying to read everything. Then they will depend on luck. They will say, “Since I will not be able to read the whole book, let me guess which question my teacher is going to ask me.” Then they select ten or twelve questions to study, only to discover, to their extreme sorrow, that the teacher has not asked those questions. If you are a good student, throughout the year you are reading. Then, by examination time, you have read the whole book. Then no matter which question the teacher asks, you will be able to pass.</p>
<p>God is also a Teacher. If you practise meditation every day, then on your soul’s day you will easily receive from Him. Otherwise, five or six days before your birthday you will try to become very pure, very sincere, very self-giving. Before that, for eleven and a half months you led an unaspiring life, an undivine life. For eleven and a half months you slept and then in fifteen days you will try to become a perfect instrument of God! Then how will you pass your examination? During those eleven months, every day God was trying to teach you, but you neglected your study. In fifteen days are you going to cover the whole year’s lessons? It is impossible.</p>
<p>Again, there are always some lucky people who study at the eleventh hour and pass because God is so compassionate to them. The teacher happened to ask the question they studied — all by sheer luck. But how many people can have that kind of luck? By sheer luck you may pass the examination one year, but every year will you pass the examination? One year, by chance, you may pass, but the next year you will fail. Then the third year you will give up your studies and go home.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, if throughout the year you do not study and before your birthday you want to become a saint, it does not happen. It is a gradual process. Regularity is of paramount importance. Punctuality is also important. But if you fail in punctuality, at least try to maintain your regularity. Punctuality is difficult, but regularity is not. Throughout the year you have to be regular and punctual in your meditation. Then automatically receptivity comes. But if you say, “On my birthday I will aspire and become a perfect person. All of a sudden, an angel will descend from Heaven and transform my bald head and give me lots of hair and I will look so beautiful,” no, no, no. That angel will never descend. Every day, ever hour, every second you have to aspire.</p>
<p><em>[Sri Chinmoy then spontaneously composed a special birthday song:]</em></p>

<p>“Freedom within, freedom without” —<br /> Today’s shout.<br /> “To please my Lord in His own Way<br /> I came into the world” —<br /> Tomorrow’s whisper.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy’s commentary:</em> Today’s world is full of desire. The desire-world wants freedom. Today’s shout is “Freedom, freedom, freedom — I came into the world to enjoy freedom!” We cry for freedom, but freedom we never get.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s world will be full of aspiration. Tomorrow’s whisper wants to please God in His own Way. As soon as we start aspiring, we see that it is God Himself who is aspiring in us, through us and for us.</p>
