<p>At four o'clock in the morning I wanted to run for three miles, but the course I picked took fifty-two minutes. Then in the afternoon I asked Peter to take me along the same course. He measured it and found it was five miles and twelve hundred metres-practically six miles. How did I go so far? It is difficult to judge the distance if you don't know the route and you have to go just by time.</p>
<p>In the car I was wearing a running suit, a thick sweater and then a rubber suit on top of that. I even had on my hat and gloves. Peter turned on the heat as high as possible, and after checking the course, we continued driving in the car. All this to lose weight in Peter's "sauna"! After twenty minutes it was too much. We opened up the window. We drove another two miles and then I walked for two miles.</p>

<p>In today's three-mile race in Flushing Meadow Park I saw Snigdha after one hundred metres. I couldn't believe it, but she was falling behind me. For eight hundred metres she ran with me and then she finally went ahead.</p>
<p>After the first four hundred metres I was still with the boys. What was I doing there? Mukunda and others were behind me. My time for the first mile was 6:39. Had it been only a one-mile race, for the last three hundred metres I could have gone faster, and my time for the mile would have been better.</p>
<p>Nirjhari caught me when I started walking. She passed me and left a large gap between us. I said, "Go ahead, go ahead!" Then Subala passed me, then Linda. Nayana passed me after a mile and a half. I said, "Go!"</p>

<p>In the five-mile race today I couldn't imagine what happened to Adrian from Australia. He started walking after one mile. Then after running for 150 metres, again he started walking. As I was watching him, I said to myself, "He has got my job." He is such an excellent runner, but he was walking after only one mile.</p>

<p>In the five-mile race I was very bad. I was telling Gangadhar to defeat Snigdha, his wife's best friend. But Gangadhar just raised his arms and surrendered. Of course, it was the human in me that told him to defeat her; the divine in me always wants whoever deserves it to win.</p>
<p>Gangadhar is a man. What was he doing behind Snigdha? When I encouraged him, the distance between him and Snigdha became even wider. The moment I told him to defeat her, Snigdha started going faster.</p>
<p>Later I saw Snighdha in her car quite happy and cheerful. I thought that definitely she had defeated Gangadhar. Then I found out that he had defeated her by one second.</p>

<p>Today when I went out on a short run, for at least two hundred metres I was following Prabhir. Then, after that I didn't see him at all. What happened to him I don't know. I was waiting for the light to change and I was looking forward. When I started running again, I didn't see Prabhir. At one point I turned around, but I saw only Dorothee from the Zurich Centre, who came out of the blue. Prabhir always reminds me of John Landy, the world champion runner.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Exhaustion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Exhaustion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>As you know, I am a wonderful runner. I can inspire my children to run, but when it is a matter of me personally, from the beginning to the end running is sheer torture. I run. Why? The secret reason is so that I will not get fat and compete with Indian swamis in fatness. But the main reason is to inspire my disciples to run, so that they can become fit instruments of the Supreme.</p>
<p>This morning I got inspiration to run at six o'clock. Usually I go running much earlier, but today I went late. I ran one, two, three, four, five and then six miles, until I reached Dan's Supreme Supermarket. This is my usual turnaround point on that course. Then I became tired and started running and walking. Three hundred metres I would run and then fifty metres I would walk. In that way I covered another three miles. Finally, I was totally exhausted. Totally is not an exaggeration; it is an understatement. I was seeing everything as white or black or brown. My eyes were not functioning at all!</p>
<p>I stood and rested for a while and then I started walking. While I was walking I saw a very old, crippled lady using a cane. I said, "O God, You are still kind to me. At least I don't belong to her group."</p>
<p>I was dying of thirst; I was so dehydrated! But I didn't have a cent with me. What could I do?</p>
<p>Now, begging is not in my line. God gave me stupid pride, which I still have. Three times I was about to beg individuals for a dime to make a phone call. But when I went near them, I said, "What will happen if they don't give me the dime?" That was my stupidity. I passed two gas stations and each time I was about to ask for water or for a dime, but again I was afraid of what would happen. At one point I saw a young boy. It seemed to me that he had money. I was about to tell him that if he gave me a dime, in fifteen minutes I would give him a ten dollar bill. Again I said, "What will happen if he does not give me the money?"</p>
<p>I was struggling and struggling. Perhaps I have never been so exhausted. I felt as if I had run fifty miles, which I have never done. Still I went on. At one place there was a sign that said "College Point." I stood there for five minutes and then I started walking. I had covered over two hundred metres when all of a sudden I saw a car stop near me. A gentleman came out of the car and asked me the way to College Point. As you know, I am not very good at giving directions. Most sympathetically I told him that I didn't know. Then I came back to my senses and realised that I had just seen the sign and had even been standing there. But by that time the car had passed by. That kind of tiredness I had!</p>
<p>When I was only six hundred metres away from my house, I was so exhausted that I said, "Let me wait here for ten minutes. Let me take rest for ten minutes." then I finally walked home.</p>
<p>So running can make people very tired if they are useless runners like me. It is always advisable to carry some change or a dollar with you. For me it is always advisable to take someone with me when I run — preferably someone with a car, not a runner. Yesterday I took Peter with me. But when you take someone with you, at that time you are not exhausted. Yesterday I ran seven miles. I was showing off, running quite fast. When you take someone along with you, at that time you do not need help. And then when you don't take someone, at that time all the world's help you need.</p>

<p>During our marathon in New Jersey I ran thirteen miles. For the first seven miles I ran at an 8:10 pace. X was running just a little ahead of me. She wasn't looking over her shoulder, but each time I came near her, all of a sudden her speed would increase. Whenever I came only four or five metres behind her, she would hear my footsteps and go faster. But she never looked behind her.</p>
<p>I tell my disciples to surrender, but I myself don't know how to surrender, especially to my girl runner-disciples. Each time I am determined to defeat them badly.</p>

<p>During my thirteen-mile run today, only once did I walk a few metres while drinking water. Otherwise, the rest of the way I ran.</p>
<p>The first two years I ran in the New York City Marathon, I had cramps in spite of my practising. This year, I have not been able to practise. How will I be able to run the marathon?</p>
<p>When you run long distance, as opposed to short distance, you sometimes feel that you won't be able to complete the race. You are afraid that you will get cramps and won't be able to finish the distance.</p>

<p>At five o'clock this morning when I went out to run, inwardly I blessed X's soul because today is his birthday. Then, a little after six-thirty, I went out to run again and this time I saw X in the physical. He was near Y's house. I was running down the 150th Street hill when I saw him press his wristwatch and start running with long strides. I thought that I would turn around and meet him. But then I said to myself, "I will never be able to catch him."</p>

<p>As in the outer running I struggle and struggle and struggle in order to survive — while winning the race is far, far beyond my imagination — even so, most of my disciples struggle and struggle and struggle in the inner running. Unfortunately, the goal is still a far, far cry for them.</p>
<p>But who knows, in the near or distant future I may make satisfactory progress in my outer running, although I just completed half a century. Similarly, my disciples can and will make satisfactory progress in their inner running.</p>
<p>This is my fervent hope, and I do hope that my Beloved Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, will fulfil my soulful and prayerful wish.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday was a wonderful day. Around six o'clock in the morning I was running in front of my house, doing my speed work — fifty metres slow and fifty metres fast. Then I saw the fat lady who is very fond of me, with her two dogs. Two or three years ago she had a fight with another lady while walking her dog, and I took the fat lady's side. So she always shows me her gratitude.</p>
<p>After each hundred metres, I was taking rest for a few seconds. At one particular moment I took rest and walked. The white dog was following me — not chasing me — and barking.</p>
<p>The lady said to me, "So you see, you see!"</p>
<p>I said, "Good morning, good morning!"</p>
<p>The lady said, "Like your other followers, my dog also is following you. He will be a very good follower."</p>
<p>So I thanked her.</p>
