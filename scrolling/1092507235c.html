  <h2 id="page-title">Woman</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Woman" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Very often it is found that man's certainty is less infallible than woman's mere speculation Fortunately or unfortunately, women no longer desire to equal men. Now they want to compete with men. We believe that no woman would put up with Tolstoy's ruthless blows. He makes bold to say, "Regard the society of women as a necessary unpleasantness of social life, and avoid it as much as possible." But Rabindranath extols women to the skies. "Woman is endowed with the passive qualities of chastity, modesty, devotion, and power of self-sacrifice in a greater measure than man is." Further his prophetic voice speaks: "...The women, the feebler creatures, — feebler at least in their outer aspects, — who are less muscular, and who have been behind-hand, always left under the shadow of those huge creatures, the men, — they will have their place, and those bigger creatures will have to give way."</p>
<p>To quote a still higher praise — rather, the highest: "Had man's mind not been energised by the inner working of woman's vital charm, he would never have attained his success. Of all the higher achievements of civilisation — the devotion of the toiler, the valour of the brave, the creations of the artist, — the secret spring is to be found in woman's influence."</p>
<p>Again he throws considerable light on woman in one of his conversations with Sri Dilip Kumar Roy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...If woman had been but an exact counterpart of man, with exactly the same part to play, life as we know it would have ceased to exist long ago. But fortunately, woman is not man's replica, but his fellow-pilgrim in their joint journey through life and that is why the march still continues-the Lila, the play. <em> — Among the Great</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Xanthippe and Mrinalini</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Xanthippe and Mrinalini" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Tagore's wife Mrinalini Devi had many good qualities. Her sacrifice to the cause of Tagore's fulfilment in life, especially in connection with the founding of Shantiniketan, was great. She did not hesitate in the least: rather, with immense joy she gave away even her personal ornaments and other belongings to run the school.</p>
<p>Now Xanthippe. What a contrast! Poor Socrates, the unparalleled philosopher of the time, suffered grievously at his wife's hands. In other words, should we not rather say in the words of Xenophon, an intimate friend of Socrates as well as a military Commander, that Socrates' wife had a 'shrewish temper, which Socrates bore patiently.'</p>
<p>I believe we can say without much ado that the wife of the poet was simply an embodied sacrifice, while that of the philosopher was a sad misfortune personified.</p>

<p>Tagore's birth-centenary was indeed an occasion of rejoicing for us, his admirers, and for enthusiasts of Culture all over the world. It was for the youth of the globe to hail this hallowed opportunity by offering to the Master-poet their profound homage.</p>
<p>When defeatism was threatening, rather, invading the Indians, Tagore did his part of duty: he infused the indomitable spirit of self-reliance into the minds of the Indian youths with his penetrating and enlightening songs.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Zeal</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Zeal" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Keats' <em>Endymion</em> is, no doubt, a grand success with its wonderful vividness and splendid felicity. But his <em>Hyperion</em> was, according to many critics, a sad failure. However, one cannot say that <em>Hyperion</em> has no magnificence at all. As ill-luck would have it, when this epic was brought to light, the poet was savagely criticised even by his bosom friends. As a result, his health broke down and the long-threatening consumption grew more formidable. He was ultimately compelled to pay his debt to nature. So it will be no exaggeration to say that lack of indomitable zeal was in the main responsible for snatching away one of the wonder-poets of the world. Poor earth could not cherish his presence even for thirty fleeting years.</p>
<p>Now let us focus our attention on Rabindranath's zeal. During his earlier days he had to face very bitter criticism of his writings in season and out of season. Kaliprasanna Kabyabisharad, the well-known editor of the Bengali weekly <em>Hitavadi,</em> probably stood as the bitterest and most impossible critic of Tagore's works. His merciless pen runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Flap not your wings to fly, O pigeon-poet! Stay where you are, in your hole. Even to your babblings and to your bullyings you have given the air of poesy. That too you have published as a work of Art. And the return it has fetched you was one full rupee in cash."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any other poet of lesser zeal would have sunk down under the weight of such ruthless criticism, but Rabindranath proved to have an adamant nature. And that is why he was so successful. In spite of innumerable blows from his boyhood to the end of his life, his eyes smiled and his lips sang like the beautiful flowers and lucid sunbeams peering through the saffron robes of Dawn.</p>

<h2>World-poets</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Love seeketh not itself to please, Nor for itself hath any care, But for another gives its ease And builds a heaven in hell's despair."</p>
<p>— Blake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love so beautifully idealised can be materialised if it springs from its Highest Source and has no link with anything inferior here below.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was angry with my friend. I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe; I told it not, my wrath did grow."</p>
<p>— Blake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrath is a weakness worth getting over. Again it cannot disturb the inner equilibrium, which is worth everything.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Good to forgive. Best to forget."</p>
<p>— Browning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better than best is to remain unaffected by the shocks of the world.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell The torture of that inward hell!"</p>
<p>— Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To nurse an inward hell and escape the penalty is to ask for too much.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I awoke one morning and found myself famous. "</p>
<p>— Byron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the greater glory to the Source which has given the fame!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are never deceived; we deceive ourselves."</p>
<p>— Goethe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May the world realise this truth!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Light-more light."</p>
<p>— Goethe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infinite is the thirst for the Infinite.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."</p>
<p>— Keats</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it is the reflection of the All-Beautiful.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty.</p>
<p>— Keats</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because our great origin is both Truth and Beauty.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done."</p>
<p>— Longfellow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence says the Seer-Poet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And belief shall not be till the thing is done."</p>
<p>— Sri Aurobindo, <em>Savitri</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tell me not in mournful numbers, Life is but an empty dream."</p>
<p>— Longfellow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather, life, the great gift of God, is a splendid field for self-realisation.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."</p>
<p>— Milton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the sign of a great spirit perverted.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"To be weak is miserable, doing or suffering."</p>
<p>— Milton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weakness is an implied denial of one's true self.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"What is done can't be undone."</p>
<p>— Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True in a limited context, never an absolute truth.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Brevity is the soul of wit."</p>
<p>— Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And silence can tell even more than brevity.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our sweetest songs are those that tell us of sweetest thought."</p>
<p>— Shelley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Shelleys of the future will hear sweetest songs inspired by all-blissful thoughts.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The desire of the moth for the star, Of the night for the morrow, The devotion to something afar From the sphere of our sorrow."</p>
<p>— Shelley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Shelleys of the New Age will be singing of the transformation of the sphere of our sorrow into the sphere of our Delight!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure."</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look forward to the New World that is manifesting in the old-to the New World that will be full of Sir Galahads but with their hearts absolutely true to none and nothing else than the Divine and His Influence.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all."</p>
<p>— Tennyson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True, perhaps on the human plane. But true love is Love divine that knows no loss.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion's sake."</p>
<p>— Whitman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true seer-eye of the poet foresaw the possibility that is now on the point of realising itself.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred."</p>
<p>— Whitman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the human body is the very temple of God.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Minds that have nothing to confer find little to receive."</p>
<p>— Wordsworth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it may well be added: Minds that have little to perceive have nothing to confer.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gods approve the depth, and not the tumult of the soul."</p>
<p>— Wordsworth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a portion of the Infinite, the soul can have depth, height and breadth without measure, but tumult can never belong to the soul. It is a play of the inferior vital.</p>

<p>"A healthy body is the guest-chamber of the soul; a sick body is a prison."</p>

<div></div>
<p>"I take all knowledge to be my province."</p>

<p>No knowledge is knowledge that does not reveal the source of all knowledge. And knowledge will fulfill itself when the world takes all knowledge, including that of the Most High, for its province.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And what is needed to have ideas worked out through those brains and arms is a one-pointed will which is affirmation itself and an eternal stranger to negation.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is not possible to live pleasantly without living wisely and justly and generously."</p>
<p>— Epicurus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, pleasant living is all that the world cares for, and not the qualities associated with difficult living: hard work, discipline and self-control.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of Freedom."</p>
<p>— Hegel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may read into this noble truth the upward march of the human soul from its prison-house of ignorance to its Home of Freedom, Light and Knowledge; and its downward march to the Here — below with the riches gained in the upper sphere, which march makes the two ends meet and become one.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact."</p>
<p>— William James</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and why worth living? Because life was given to man to manifest the Divine Reality in its every aspect.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our minds are not made as large as truth nor suited to the whole extent of things."</p>
<p>— Locke</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How very true! And this recognition posits the question of the greater sources of Knowledge such as the Supermind.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"What is evil? Whatever springs from weakness."</p>
<p>— Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And where from does weakness spring? It springs from man's self-chosen separation from his true self, the divine Reality within him.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Self-conquest is the greatest of victories."</p>
<p>— Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our lower self is the formidable wall of separation from our higher or divine Self. This wall pulled down, man becomes his true self.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are bound to our bodies like an oyster to its shell."</p>
<p>— Plato</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simile implies that our consciousness is hardly a whit better than that of the dumb oyster. But true it is that man's frail body can pinion his mighty soul!</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let us dispense with the emptiness of existence. The great man is not the conqueror, but he who denies the will to live."</p>
<p>— Schopenhauer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great man is really the one who conquers that emptiness, filling it with the dynamic Truth of existence. His will to live is his will to fulfil the why of his existence.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for me, all I know is that I know nothing."</p>
<p>— Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When our humility becomes its genuine self, it becomes an open vessel for the gifts I of the Omniscient.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Survival of the fittest."</p>
<p>— Herbert Spencer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer referred to the struggle to survive in the material life. But how to be the fittest in the spiritual life? By making oneself a conscious instrument of God's Vision and Will.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nature abhors a vacuum."</p>
<p>— Spinoza</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Creation, as a manifestation of the Omnipresence, can nowhere have a vacuum.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Man is a social animal."</p>
<p>— Spinoza</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man transformed will be a divinised godhead.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whoever serves his country well has no need of ancestors."</p>
<p>— Voltaire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An architect who shapes his own life hangs not on his pedigree. His descendants will number their ancestors and count their lineage from him, the seed.</p>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the known world, excepting only savage nations, is governed by books."</p>
<p>— Voltaire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence the necessity of more and more revealing books-books that can reveal the yet-unknown truths of man and nations.</p>

<p>Greatness is not the monopoly of any individual. Mother Earth has been blessed with many outstanding children who have helped her soaring aspiration for Perfect Perfection. These sons and daughters have made significant spiritual, philosophical, intellectual, aesthetic, scientific and political contributions. We can join the earth in her deep appreciation and gratitude for the genuine efforts made by her brave hero-children.</p>
<p>As a spiritual Master, Sri Chinmoy is full of admiration for the spiritual giants who have preceded him. But his gratitude extends likewise to those who have enriched earth with aesthetic, scientific, intellectual and political achievements. With his inner eye, Sri Chinmoy can enter into the soul of any past or present being. In this book, written in India before he came to the West in 1964, Sri Chinmoy records the soul's qualities as well as the inner and outer achievements of various Indian leaders.</p>
<p><em>Mother India's Lighthouse</em> is a collection of essays on eminent Indian figures. These leaders, some of whom are perhaps little known in the West, are all beloved throughout their Motherland. The study of their lives gives us Western readers valuable insights into a cross-section of Indian achievements.</p>
<p><em>Rabindranath, The Myriad-Minded</em> and <em>The Disciple And The Master</em> are in-depth studies of Indians well known even in the West. The poetry of Nobel Prize-winner Rabindranath Tagore is surcharged with his spiritual vision. Sri Chinmoy's own poetic genius shines through every page of this commentary on his illustrious fellow Bengali.</p>
<p><em>The Disciple And The Master</em> tells of Sri Ramakrishna, the greatest spiritual Master of the nineteenth century, and Vivekananda, his beloved disciple. Coming directly from Sri Chinmoy's most intimate inner connection with both of these towering spiritual figures, these delightful and illumining glimpses provide revealing new insights into the souls of the Master and the Disciple.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy's appreciation extends also to the achievements of the West. In <em>World Philosophers</em> and <em>World Poets</em> he has selected several lines from the writings of each of various great creative intellects which represent the core of that particular author's life-work. Sri Chinmoy then adds his own clarifying, expanding and illumining commentary.</p>
