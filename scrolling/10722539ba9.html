<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are nothing. My biceps are not even 14 inches. That is why I am saying that my weightlifting achievements are all due to concentration and meditation. You may think that concentration, prayer and meditation are only for the inner life. But I wish to say no! We can use our inner strength for the outer life as well. From meditation and concentration we can get inner power, and this power can be used in the physical world as well. One way to lift up things is to develop large, strong muscles. But in my case, I have been training for only 15 months. So I entirely depend on the inner strength.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As I said before, I do not believe in meditating in the mountain caves or in the depths of the forest. Our philosophy and way of meditation is to accept the world as it is. We try to become better and inspire others to make their lives better. Some say that meditation is meant only for the select few. But I say that meditation is for everybody, for we are all God’s children. Just because we value the outer life, we feel that prayer and meditation can be practised amidst our day-to-day activities — not only in a church or a temple or some other sacred place.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have read and seen on television that you have achieved quite a number of astonishing feats. What is the connection between your search for peace and what you are doing with weightlifting?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have read and seen on television that you have achieved quite a number of astonishing feats. What is the connection between your search for peace and what you are doing with weightlifting?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is an important link between what I am doing at the United Nations and what I am doing when I lift up weights, elephants and so forth. In my weightlifting I am trying to show that if you pray and meditate, you can bring to the fore your inner strength. Now, if somebody is really inwardly strong, he is always at peace. When you have confidence and strength within you, then you do not go outside to quarrel or fight with others. If you are secure at home, then you do not leave your house and start quarrelling and finding fault with your neighbours. It is only because you are insecure that you try to fight with others, because you are always afraid that they are going to surpass you.</p>
<p>Because countries inwardly feel insecure, they go out and fight with other countries. But the country that is inwardly secure will not come forward to fight; such a thing is beneath its dignity. An elephant is not going to approach a dog and attack it. The dog will bark and bark at the elephant, making the world feel that it is so strong, but the elephant will just ignore the dog.</p>
<p>So when I lift up some heavy weight, I am hoping to inspire others to also bring forward their own inner strength. Inner strength is not my monopoly. Far from it. Everybody has it. Only it has to be brought forward. If everybody can bring forward his inner strength, then everybody will be secure and nobody will try to attack anybody else.</p>
<p>When we are inwardly strong, not only do we not attack the world but we feel our oneness with the world. And it is out of the feeling of oneness that solid peace comes. Because the different parts of your body have established oneness with each other, they do not feel jealous of one another. When your arm lifts a weight, your eyes or your ears are not jealous, because all the parts of your body have established their oneness. Every part of your body feels joy in the body’s achievements.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you and I feel our heart’s oneness, whatever you achieve I also claim as my own achievement. If I claim your achievement as my own, then how can I be afraid that you will surpass me? There is no fear or competition; there is only self-giving. I will give you what I have, and you will give me what you have. So oneness, based on inner security, is the only foundation for world peace.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy’s weightlifting-comet began its orbit on 26 June 1985 when he first took up the sport. A humble 40-pound dumbbell marked his debut. During the following months, the world witnessed this comet hurtling towards its zenith with a velocity and an energy that challenged all our preconceived ideas of human potential.</p>
<p>On 27 November 1986 Sri Chinmoy succeeded in lifting a 2,039-pound dumbbell overhead and supporting it with one arm. Three days later, he lifted 2,000 pounds using a standing calf raise. Even then, he continued to blaze a trail across our skies. On 20 January 1987 Sri Chinmoy succeeded in lifting a dumbbell weighing 3,081 3/4 pounds.</p>
<p>Gazing at the mysterious passage of this human comet, we find ourselves asking how and why such impossible feats have suddenly become possible. Far transcending the domain of sheer physical strength, they seem to be more in tune with the vast cosmic forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy’s answers to the many questions posed by his students, the media and bodybuilding and weightlifting experts, enlighten us by explaining how we can establish a free access to this inner source of power. His secrets are not training or diet-related. His secrets are meditation, prayer and absolute faith in God. With a heart of loving oneness, he encourages others to try this inner approach and experience for themselves the joy of touching the Infinite.</p>
