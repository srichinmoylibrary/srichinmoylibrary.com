<p>While I was shopping in Washington, D.C., I went into a restaurant and asked the man at the counter for a glass of orange juice. He said his cash register was broken and he could not make change.</p>
<p>The orange juice cost 59 cents and all I had was a dollar bill. So I said, "That's all right. Please give me the orange juice and just keep the change."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, I can't do that." Then he looked at me and said, "But you're a nice man, so I'll do it." Then he gave me a doughnut and said, "Here, you eat this. Then it comes to almost a dollar."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't want a doughnut." But he insisted that I take it.</p>
<p>While I was there another man came in — a nice-looking gentleman, tall and stout, wearing glasses. He also only had a dollar bill. But the man at the counter wouldn't give him anything. He pointed to me and said, "I only did it for him because he's a nice man."</p>
<p>As the stout gentleman was leaving, the man said to me, "I think he's a crook!"</p>

<p>The story never ends. I was shopping and shopping and shoppin — -in other words, just getting lost. People told me to go to 14th Street and F. But did I know where F or G was? When you ask people, usually they give wrong information!</p>
<p>Finally I got back to the hotel and was about to enter the elevator when I saw the same tall and stout gentleman with glasses. I couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>He looked at me and said, "So, you are a nice man and I am not a nice man!" What could I do? I just smiled at him.</p>

<p>I went into a restaurant for a salad and onion rings. An elderly couple happened to be beside me. As I was about to leave, the lady said to me, "Are you a boxer? You look like a boxer."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am not a boxer, but I do lift weights."</p>
<p>The lady said, "I thought you were very strong."</p>
<p>Her husband didn't say anything, but he was very amused that his wife was such a talker.</p>

<p>The hotel where I stayed in Washington is so bad! No matter when you go, the hotel is always under construction and the rooms are so undivine. The people are also very undivine.</p>
<p>When I checked into the hotel, I paid the bill and got a receipt. Normally I do not keep receipts, but this time I did.</p>
<p>When I was ready to check out, they said to me, "You have not paid for your room."</p>
<p>I said, "I gave you three twenty dollar bills and you gave me four dollars change. I have the receipt."</p>
<p>They said, "This receipt is no good. It wasn't stamped."</p>
<p>I said, "But how could I get the receipt if I didn't pay?"</p>
<p>For ten minutes this went on. The girl who had originally taken the money from me was not there. Finally, the assistant manager came and said, "There is no indication on the receipt that you have paid."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lord Chidananda was on the street waiting for me with the car.</p>
<p>Then out of the blue a young girl behind the counter said, "I think he did pay." She had been there at the time and she remembered me.</p>

<p>When I went to get radiation treatment for my knee, the technician said to me, "Are you <em>the</em> Sri Chinmoy from the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He couldn't believe it. He was showing me such love and such respect.</p>
<p>He asked, "Can I take your picture?"</p>
<p>I told him to take it and gave him a nice smile.</p>
<p>When I went back the following day, the technician asked, "Can I have a picture taken with you?"</p>
<p>His name was John. I gave him a T-shirt and he was so happy. He has run two marathons and now wants to run our marathon.</p>

<p>As soon as I sat down on the plane for my trip to India, a Frenchman was so kind to me. My handbag was a little big, so he took it from me and put it under the seat in front of him to give me more legroom. Then he asked me if I needed a blanket and a pillow. Who will do this kind of thing?</p>
<p>He asked me if I am interested in Indian culture. Being an Indian, I had to say that I am. O God, then he asked me what kind of Indian dancing I prefer. I am the right person!</p>
<p>He said he was learning to play the piano and was just a beginner. Then he asked me if I am also interested in piano.</p>
<p>I said, "I am also a beginner, although I have made a tape." I promised to send him my piano tape.</p>
<p>Then he gave me his card and asked for my card. Luckily, I was carrying some Centre envelopes with me, so I gave him an envelope that had my return address.</p>

<p>When I was waiting in line at immigration at the Madras airport on my way back to New York, India's foremost tennis player, Ramesh Krishnan, was just behind me.</p>
<p>I congratulated him on winning the Davis Cup, and invited him to come to our tennis ground in New York. I made a spontaneous request, and he gave an immediate acceptance.</p>
<p>By the time we passed through immigration, he was way ahead of me. So he came back to where I was and asked for my card. In the future I have to carry a card!</p>
<p>Luckily, I still had a Centre envelope. But I also wanted to give him my phone number. I had brought six or seven ballpoint pens with me; but now that I needed one, none was available. I searched and searched and finally found one. So I gave him Annam Brahma's phone number.</p>
<p>Then some officials came and took him through customs. He was a great man so he got special treatment. Poor me, I had to wait on line.</p>
<p>On the flight from Madras to Bombay, God alone knows where he sat. But on the flight from Bombay to London, we both happened to be on the upper deck in Clipper Class. He was sitting very near me and we could see each other clearly.</p>
<p>He knows how to sleep! He slept through two or three meals. While he was sleeping, like a rogue I was observing how strong his wrist and arm were.</p>

<p>Sanatan and Rupantar were driving. Ketan and Sagar were supposed to be their helpers and keep them awake, but they were lying down on the floor of the bus sleeping. Ketan had brought a big teddy bear, but instead of holding the teddy bear, he was holding Christopher.</p>

<p>In Milan the audience showed me utmost devotion. After each instrument they clapped and clapped. After the girls sang, they also clapped. It was sincere appreciation.</p>
<p>Afterwards, four hundred seekers came onto the stage to pick up a flower petal. With such devotion they picked it up, and with such sincere and loving devotion they passed by me. Many were folding their hands, and some knelt down and gave me sweets or flowers.</p>
<p>I had quite a good experience in Milan. But the performance was absolutely useless because the acoustics were so bad. It was not Dhanu's fault at all. Everything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong. Also, it was raining cats and dogs outside. But the seekers' sincere oneness with my aspiration-heart saved me! Their aspiration and devotion turned that night of frustration into a day of satisfaction.</p>

<p>I was supposed to play the organ at St. Peter's Basilica, but at the last minute Kulai cancelled the appointment because he thought that I would not get there on time. Fortunately, they were able to reschedule the appointment.</p>
<p>People were already gathering for the mass when I started to play, so there was no time for me to meditate or anything. I was fighting against the clock.</p>
<p>While I was playing, sunlight was shining on a framed picture of a dove. It was very beautiful.</p>
<p>The priest who was observing me was stiffness incarnate. He was watching to see if I was going to break the organ. After five minutes he placed his hand on my shoulder, indicating that it was time for me to stop so they could begin the mass. The mass lasted for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The man in charge said I could play for as long as I wanted when the mass ended. He was so kind to me. I played for fifteen minutes. Afterwards, he thanked me and said, "Bravo, bravo!"</p>

<p>The President of the World Veterans' Games, Don Farquaharson, is a Canadian. At the Melbourne airport, he came up to me full of kindness and appreciation and said, "Do you recognise me? I saw you at the Games in Puerto Rico." He talked to me about this and that for quite a while; he was so happy to see me.</p>
<p>When I was at the stadium, again the President came up to me. At that time I was in a meditative consciousness.</p>
<p>He said, "Sorry to disturb your meditation. I have come to introduce my son to you. My son and his new wife are enjoying their honeymoon here. I want them to meet you and see your meditation."</p>
<p>So he introduced them both to me. Then he said, "Can we have a picture taken with you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Of course."</p>
<p>Then he, his daughter-in-law and his son all stood next to me for a picture.</p>
