  <h2 id="page-title">The Guru, part 2</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Guru, part 2" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>All berries are not edible. Likewise all are not Gurus that men may flock to.</p>
<p>What does the acceptance of a disciple by a Guru mean? It means that the Guru will gladly live in the world of golden sacrifice.</p>
<p>If the disciple discovers within himself the pangs of fear and not the fount of love for his Guru, sorrow and spiritual frustration will dog him throughout his discipleship.</p>
<p>The Guru sees in his disciple the very image of God. So he is all sacrifice to the disciple. The disciple sees and feels in his Guru the only shelter of his limitations. So he is all love for his Guru.</p>
<p>The Guru can kindle the lamp in you. When? Only after you have brought him the wick and the oil.</p>
<p>O disciple! Do you know the most foolish customer on earth? He is your Guru and your Guru alone. He buys your ignorance and gives you knowledge; he buys your impotence and gives you power. Can you ever imagine a more foolish bargain? Now learn the name of your Guru’s foolishness: Compassion and nothing else.</p>
<p>The Guru’s body is the Compassion-Net. It entraps the disciples, sleeping or awakened, with all their baffling age-long problems of ignorance.</p>
<p>It has become a fashion nowadays for man to say that there is no necessity of an intermediary between him and God, referring not only to the traditional priest, but also to the traditional Guru. Granted, but just tell me. Did you receive any help in learning the alphabet? Did you require a teacher to help you master your musical instrument? Were you given instruction to enable you to obtain your degree? If you needed a helper to do these things, do you not also require a teacher who can guide you to the knowledge of the Divine, the wisdom of the infinite? That teacher is your Guru and no one else.</p>
<p>O man, do you have no love for the temple inside which you worship the idol? Then you must love the body of the Guru, if you aspire to worship the Omnipotent in him.</p>
<p>To achieve realisation oneself and alone is like crossing the ocean in a raft. But to achieve realisation through the Grace of a Guru is like crossing the Ocean in a swift and strong boat, which ferries you safely across the sea of ignorance to the Golden Shore.</p>
<p>Who can show a disciple his true Motherland? The Guru. What is the name of that Motherland? Consciousness: Consciousness Infinite, Consciousness All- Pervading.</p>
<p>The real work, if there be any, of a Guru is to show the world that his deeds are in perfect harmony with his teachings.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Each soul is not only an important page in the Book of Fate, but also essential to it, for without it the Book must needs be incomplete.</p>
<p>Each soul is a representative and a presentation of the Supreme on earth. When the representative is recognised by its owner, the presentation fulfils itself in the Supreme.</p>
<p>The soul comes into birth for experience. And its experience will be complete when it brings down all the perfection of the Divine into Matter.</p>
<p>God touches Matter. Lo, the miracle of miracles: the psychic being comes into existence. Earth-consciousness is the Mother of the child, which develops into an individuality perfected and guided by the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>The psychic being stores up the quintessence of past experiences and it has very little to do with form and personality.</p>
<p>The Promised Land is for him who perpetually lives in the widening pastures of the soul.</p>
<p>Selfless emotion has an appreciable function of its own. When it knocks, the psychic being cannot help opening the door.</p>
<p>Whenever our soul gets the opportunity of breaking open the door of our ignorance, it speaks in silence to our wakeful mind: “Think not of today’s failure, but concentrate on tomorrow’s victory.”</p>
<p>The smile of our soul is the inner strength given to our life to brave the buffets of unavoidable adversity.</p>
<p>The vital can sit at most at the foot of the mountain; the mind near the top of the mountain; the soul sits right on the peak.</p>
<p>In the relationship between the human soul and the Divine soul, the former embraces, the Latter blesses.</p>
<p>Our sleeping mind feels God as an inexpressible sigh. Our soul feels God as an unexpressed All-Loving Smile.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Transformation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Transformation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Neither an individual effort nor an individual abnegation can bring about the transformation of your consciousness. This transformation is possible only by the descent of a Higher Light.</p>
<p>To think of physical transformation without having some kind of realisation is to count your chickens before they are hatched.</p>
<p>Surrender has to look up with folded hands. Transformation has to look down with palms facing the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>The transformation of human nature in its completeness must unavoidably progress at the speed of a tortoise.</p>
<p>Both the descent of Truth into the lower nature and the ascent of the lower nature into the higher Truth are capable of solving the problem of problems, the illumination of human consciousness. They are equally effective and have an equal speed.</p>
<p>Be Universal in your love. You will see the universe to be the picture of your own being.</p>
<p>There is but one Knowledge. There is but one Realisation. You are at once the Seeker and the Fulfiller.</p>
<p>What is liberation? It is the extinction of a divided consciousness in the all-pervading oneness of the Supreme.</p>
<p>What is meant by spiritual perfection? It is the constant capacity to live in God and to reveal Him in one’s every moment.</p>
<p>In the field of true spirituality, Experience serves as breakfast; Realisation as lunch; Transformation as dinner.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The consciousness of history</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The consciousness of history" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>From time immemorial, History has been dealing with tyrants and liberators. Before long, it will have to deal seriously with peacemakers.</p>
<p>History is the fountain-head of man’s moments of self-expression, drawn from his conscious or unconscious choice of forces in the world.</p>
<p>When man chooses the force of Truth, ever at play on earth’s atmosphere, he aligns himself with evolution’s greatest power.</p>
<p>When he allows himself to become the instrument of the force of Darkness, he becomes the ally of evolution’s greatest regressive agent.</p>
<p>Both the beauty of truth and the ugliness of falsehood have an ever-failing friend: History.</p>
<p>History ever drifts from the wind of an imponderable sigh to the sunshine of a stupendous smile.</p>
<p>Who has eyes that look backward even when they consciously look forward? The deep-penetrating dweller in the core of History.</p>
<p>What is History, after all? Is it not merely what man has chosen to regard as important? History has been until now a record of man’s values. But the time will soon come when it will become a record of God’s values, a study of man’s growth from blind infancy to the full maturity of enlightened spirituality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Concentration and meditation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Concentration and meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Concentration is the Arrow.</p>
<p>Meditation is the Bow.</p>
<p>When you concentrate, you focus all your energies upon the chosen phenomenon in order to unveil its mysteries. When you meditate, you rise into a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>Concentration wants to penetrate into the object it strives for. Meditation wants to live in the vastness of Silence.</p>
<p>In concentration, you endeavour to bring the consciousness of your object right into your own awareness. In meditation, you rise from your limited consciousness into a higher and wider domain.</p>
<p>If you want to sharpen your faculties, concentrate. If you want to lose yourself, meditate.</p>
<p>It is the work of concentration to clear the roads when meditation wants to go either deep within or high above.</p>
<p>Concentration wants to seize the knowledge it aims at. Meditation wants to identify itself with the knowledge it seeks for.</p>
<p>An aspirant has two genuine teachers: Concentration and Meditation. Concentration is always strict with the student; Meditation is strict at times. But both of them are solemnly interested in their students’ progress.</p>
<p>Concentration says to God: “Father, I am coming to You.” Meditation says to God: “Father, do come to me.”</p>
<p>Concentration is the commander who orders the dispersed consciousness to come to attention.</p>
<p>Concentration and absolute firmness are not only inseparable, but are interdependent divine warriors.</p>
<p>Concentration does not allow Disturbance, the thief, to enter into his armour. Meditation lets him in. Why? Just to catch the thief red-handed.</p>
<p>Concentration challenges the enemy to a duel and fights him out. Meditation, with its silent smile, diminishes the challenge of the enemy.</p>
<p>Concentration and the surface mind dislike each other. Concentration opens the door to higher states of consciousness, while the surface mind wants to stay where it has always been.</p>
<p>The mind that is incapable of concentration is as changeable as the wind and as elusive as moonlight.</p>
<p>When concentration reaches its acme, revelation dawns. Newton saw the law of gravitation in the falling of an apple; Archimedes discovered the secret of displacement and cried out, “Eureka!"; J. C. Bose discovered life in plants, even in metals. The crown of success is attainable only in moments of deepest concentration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Prosperity and adversity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Prosperity and adversity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Prosperity and Adversity are the two eyes that we all have. Adversity leads us inward to correct and perfect our march of life. Prosperity leads us outward to illuminate and immortalise our human birth.</p>
<p>In prosperity our inner strength remains static. In adversity our inner strength becomes dynamic.</p>
<p>None can deny the fact that every step of progress which the world has made has come from both the smiles of prosperity and the tears of adversity.</p>
<p>Adversity, like poverty, is no sin. One merit of adversity none can deny: It helps us to be stronger within. The stronger we are within, the brighter we are without.</p>
<p>“No suffering, no salvation,” so says the teacher Adversity to his student, man.</p>
<p>“No soul’s delight, no salvation,” so says the teacher Prosperity to his student, man.</p>
<p>One who is afraid of studying in the school of adversity can never hope for a perfect education in life.</p>
<p>Misfortune threatens prosperity.</p>
<p>Hope ignores adversity.</p>
<p>How often is our aspiration forced into play by dire adversity; but in glorious prosperity how rarely it peeps out.</p>
<p>No fall, no rise. Just as a wrestler often bears away the prize only after he has suffered numerous falls, even so Hell is to be experienced before Heaven is won.</p>
<p>What is failure, if not an important portion, unrecognised, in the configuration of our whole fruitful success?</p>
<p>Failure can have a soothing medicine to relieve it from its pangs, and that medicine is consolation. Failure can have an energising medicine to relieve it from its pangs, and that medicine is Will-power.</p>
<p>The world is strewn with difficulties. In a sense, it is full of thorns. But if you put on shoes you can walk on the thorns. What are these shoes made of? They are made of God’s Grace.</p>
<p>Depression is the most effective smile of a wrong force. Once we allow it to enter, depression tries to crush the strength and joy of our life-force.</p>
<p>Illness often has very little to do with the Divine Will. It is rather the acceptance of imperfection’s invasion.</p>
<p>The pain of the body is often bearable. Not so is the pain of the heart.</p>
<p>Sorrow is an arrow to pierce into strength. Joy is food to feed strength sumptuously.</p>
<p>Sorrow lords it over the world. But the very presence of Time makes it lose its sting.</p>
<p>Time is the best physician for suffering. Then comes patience. And then comes tolerance.</p>
<p>Man is the visible hyphen between yesterday’s torture and tomorrow’s fear.</p>
<p>Natural justice, however painful, is mild. Legal justice, however mild, is atrocious torture.</p>
<p>Despair is an unworthy and shameless guest of our inner life. We must resist it with the current of will that energises our soul.</p>
<p>Disappointment is as powerful a negative force as expectation is a positive one.</p>
<p>Worry unconsciously welcomes trouble. Trouble unavoidably welcomes helplessness. Helplessness tearfully welcomes despair.</p>
<p>Human life is at once a burden and a blessing. It compels man to bear continual suffering. It gives man also a great promise of God-Realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Matter and spirit</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Matter and spirit" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>True wisdom must dawn on human consciousness. Affirmations and negations must be synthesised and move together. The world has come to realise that integrality is the only absolute self-fulfilment.</p>
<p>Neither Spirit nor Matter is superior to the other. We will be far from Truth if we belittle Matter only to speak highly of Spirit. From Matter alone did our earthly cloak see the light of day.</p>
<p>To the materialist, the Beyond is unreal because it is not within his eye-range. He has enquired of his senses if they were aware of the Beyond. They unanimously cried out: “No, there is no such thing!”</p>
<p>The Spirit, untouched and uncontaminated by imperfection, is the sole gateman of the Transcendent. Radiant and immaculate, it bears and upholds the world. Relation it has none. Its matchless qualities are the opposites of division, duality and multiplicity.</p>
<p>The eternal Truth can never be the monopoly of the Spirit. Dauntless Matter, too, has every right to claim her equal share.</p>
<p>Our present faith in Matter is not enough. It must needs be stronger. We must see eye to eye with the Upanishads and declare that Matter also is Brahman.</p>
<p>Our absolute Freedom will come into existence from the Spirit. But Matter’s giant breast will be the field of our full manifestation.</p>
<p>The materialist is aware of the road that leads to matter. He is quite in the dark about the road that leads to the spirit. It seems that the Eternal Solace is extremely clever. It deserts both the materialist and the spiritualist en route when they want to be independent of each other.</p>
<p>Materialism has begun to far exceed the limits of sense-knowledge. With this obstruction fading away, the march of materialism is now quite safe and satisfactory towards its unimagined Goal.</p>
<p>The supreme choice of an awakened mind is an unalloyed affirmation of the soul’s light pouring into the mental vehicle.</p>
<p>Multiplicity is nothing but the outer robe of unity.</p>
<p>What is the most essential thing in our upward and inward march? Faith. Faith is the bud; knowledge is the flower. O Faith! Since you are the ceaseless breath of our hearts, we feel that before long we must win the crown of our journey’s Goal.</p>
<p>What is Silence? Silence is that which alone bears the teeming vast. It upholds activity and inactivity in its own supreme delight and places the garlands of victory around the necks of these two apparent antagonists.</p>
<p>“All this is Brahman.” The oneness of Matter and Spirit is the only affirmation of the Brahman. Therefore neither Matter nor Spirit can dwell beyond its fond and boundless clasp.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Spiritual discipline</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Spiritual discipline" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Any method of spiritual discipline will have two inevitable and inseparable wings: absolute patience and firm resolution.</p>
<p>A progressive self-giving and an absolute confidence in God can easily challenge the strength of impossibility in one’s spiritual journey.</p>
<p>March forward just three steps and God is won. Now what are the three steps? The first step is aspiration. The second step is self-giving. The third step is reliance on oneself, reliance on the Divine.</p>
<p>In the early stages of spiritual practice, to leave everything to the Divine and to think that personal effort is unnecessary is to dance before you can walk.</p>
<p>Tapasya (intense or austere discipline) says to the aspirant: “I shall make you see God.” Surrender says to the aspirant: “I shall make God see you.” Faithfulness is the only key that both Tapasya and Surrender possess to open God’s door.</p>
<p>In the ultimate analysis, no distinction can ever be made between Tapasya and Surrender. Surrender, when complete and effective, is the result of, and nothing other than the most arduous Tapasya.</p>
<p>The more complete the aspirant’s surrender, the brighter the smile of his psychic being.</p>
<p>Surrender is fondly influenced by the psychic being. Knowledge is boldly influenced by the Will.</p>
<p>Surrender is the most suitable net to entrap the Divine. It is at once wisdom and power in action.</p>
<p>Spontaneous obedience is the husk. Conscious surrender is the rice.</p>
<p>Demanding surrender says to God: “Father, I am looking at You. Be pleased to look at me. Let us look at each other.” Devoted surrender says to God: “Father, I need not look at You. You just look at me. That will do.”</p>
<p>There are three ways of fulfilling a soul’s need: either the aspirant steps forward to see the Divine; or the Divine steps forward to make the aspirant see Him; or both the aspirant and the Divine step forward simultaneously towards each other.</p>
<p>When the aspirant bitterly starves his questioning mind and feeds his surrender sumptuously, God says: “The time is ripe. I come.”</p>
<p>Surrender can never be a one-day achievement. Likewise realisation, when attained, is not a one-day wonder.</p>
<p>Although regularity in spiritual practice may appear mechanical, it is a constant blessing from above and shows the development of some inner strength.</p>
<p>To see God only during your surrender at meditation is to declare that God is absent from you more than He is present.</p>
<p>True meditation has a free access to the inner Being. True self-consecration has a free access to the right consciousness and attitude.</p>
<p>When the mind and the vital close their eyes for good, surrender, the inner strength, opens its eyes for good.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Humility</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Humility" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The seed of humility is exceptionally fertile. It may not germinate plants of power and force, but it does yield flowers of Sweetness, Grace, Modesty and Light.</p>
<p>Love for the Divine is in its essence a spontaneous spiritual humility.</p>
<p>Humility has no need to sit on the King’s throne. But the King cannot help bringing the throne to humility. And now who is the King? God’s Compassion.</p>
<p>A prayer, in its simplest and most effective definition, is humility, climbing the sky of an all-fulfilling Delight.</p>
<p>Only the true sense of humility can raise us from our knees as high as we aspire.</p>
<p>We must realise that there is only one way of acquiring infinite future possibilities. That way lies in the great power: Humility.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Admiration</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Admiration" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Admiration is not the sign of inferiority. Rather it is often a sign of the reciprocal recognition of two souls.</p>
<p>Familiarity and admiration can rarely be long-enduring friends, unless the uniqueness of the one finds an echo in the other.</p>
<p>It is easy for our admiration to win over another’s love. But often it is too difficult for our love to win over another’s admiration.</p>
<p>Can one separate our admiration from our sincerity? Decidedly not. For admiration demands a truthful selflessness.</p>
<p>Self-love must know that its annihilation will begin when admiration enters.</p>
<p>Admiration begins to show the psychic touch when it reaches out towards those eternal qualities possessed by seers, saints and sages.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Ambition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ambition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Ambition is the fond embrace of possession and expression.</p>
<p>Life is an ever-progressing reality. This is the firm conviction of ambition.</p>
<p>If your ambition is to achieve perfection, then do not destroy imperfection The destruction of imperfection can never be the way to perfection.</p>
<p>Ambition is an attempt at self-expression and self-extension. When it is based on the ego’s enlargement, we call it self-aggrandisement When it is based on the soul’s illumination, it ceases to be ambition and becomes a divine Mission.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Character</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Character" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Among the fearless soldiers that fight for your victory in life, character has no equal.</p>
<p>Character is the colossal hope of human improvement within and without.</p>
<p>Character is blazing sunshine in the soul’s abode, the body.</p>
<p>A perfect society is built upon mutual trust. Character is the source of that trust.</p>
<p>Character is just what we inwardly are and outwardly do.</p>
<p>The secret of inner success is constancy to our highest character.</p>
<p>A true aspirant is one who feels more and more cautious of the least ignorance and limitation in himself.</p>
<p>Character gives the key to open the most beautiful doors of life: Peace of Mind and Delight.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the foundation of a moral human life on earth. Self-sacrifice will be the foundation of a supramoral life on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Courage</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Courage" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Courage is the most devoted servant of one’s own faith in oneself and God.</p>
<p>Timidity says, “God is forever unknowable.” Courage says, “God is at present unknown, but only for a while.”</p>
<p>Cowardice is an extra load to carry in the march of your day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Courage is an ever-willing extra porter to carry your wealth, inner and outer, according to your soul’s volition.</p>
<p>Courage is perfection only when it springs from one’s oneness with the vision of God.</p>
<p>There is no other way to please your inner self than to be, yourself, a perfect emblem of courage.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm in its purest expression is courage.</p>
<p>Against one’s inner courage, death itself contends in vain.</p>
<p>Courage is God’s successful inspiration in Man’s body, mind, heart and soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Equanimity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Equanimity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Equanimity is the hyphen between God’s Compassion and man’s surrender.</p>
<p>Equanimity is the all-covering, all-protecting umbrella of true wisdom.</p>
<p>Whatever takes place in the divine Providence is not only for the best, but also inevitable, because there is no alternative.</p>
<p>A realised soul is he who is above likes and dislikes. He lives in the world cheerfully, but he is not of it.</p>
<p>Equanimity can by no means imply an inert acceptance. Far from it, equanimity is the living faith of a seeker in the divine Dispensation.</p>
<p>To be able to endure the buffets of life firmly and calmly is to have the full taste of matchless equanimity.</p>
<p>To take the inevitable, Unmoved, for our Goal is a divine blessing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Purity and power</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Purity and power" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Have purity first; then only will you never be devoid of power.</p>
<p>Look at the miracle of a drop of venom and a drop of purity. The former poisons the blood in your veins. The latter purifies the human soul in your body.</p>
<p>Power is not necessarily purity, but purity is sheer power.</p>
<p>There is no one who can fly as high as a divine dispenser of power. There is no man who can ruin his heart as quickly as a misuser of power.</p>
<p>To have experiences without the strength of purification is like living in the most dangerous part of the forest. This does not mean that experience must always wait for complete purification. What is actually needed is a good understanding and a true relation between growing experience and growing purification.</p>
<p>Knowledge is a secret power. When you have won knowledge, power is bound to follow it.</p>
<p>Purity is the ceaseless shower of God’s omnipotent Grace on aspiring human souls.</p>
<p>Purity is the immediate gift from the universal Treasure-House to God’s hopeful children.</p>
