<p>While I was running about four or five days ago, I passed a man who was giving a parking ticket to a car â€” God knows what he is called. I was very tired, and when he saw me he said, "Young friend, you have run enough. Now take rest."</p>
<p>After writing out the ticket, he himself sat down at the foot of a tree. He was a very old man, a very nice soul. I asked him, "Do you get joy by giving tickets to cars?"</p>
<p>"No, never!" he replied. "But will you give me my bread and butter? Daily I have to give at least ten or twelve tickets in the morning. If I do not, then my boss will fire me. He will not give me my bread and butter."</p>
<p>So we sat down and both rested for about five minutes â€” this is how I run â€” and then we went our own ways.</p>

<p>Yesterday when I was finishing a six-mile run on 150th Street, a young boy came up to me and said, "Nice style, but you need longer strides."</p>
<p>He began demonstrating, saying that after each stride I should pause and press the ground with my toes. "In this way your stride becomes longer."</p>
<p>He was very nice and demonstrated this for two minutes or so. I did not tell him that I know all the different stride techniques.</p>

<p>Around 4:30 in the morning, after running three and a half miles, I passed a very old man who was in his seventies. He was carrying a bag which had some food inside it. This happened between Queens Boulevard and Main Street.</p>
<p>He asked me, "Excuse me, which way is the subway?"</p>
<p>I said, "I'm very sorry. I don't know."</p>
<p>The old man said, "Never mind, you are a nice guy."</p>
<p>After I went on about 200 metres, I remembered: "Oh, he is walking towards the highway. How is he going to get the subway there?"</p>
<p>So I ran back to get him. O God, he was coming back; somebody else had already told him to head towards Queens Boulevard.</p>
<p>But when he saw I came back to help him, he said, "I knew you were a nice guy."</p>

<p>There are bad people, there are good people and there are very good people on earth. I don't care for pizza at all, but some of my disciples enjoy pizza like anything. A few months ago I said, "Let me please my disciples!" So I went to the pizza parlour and asked for eight pieces. The man asked me to take a whole pie. It would be a matter of ten minutes, he said, for him to get it ready.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting in the hot pizza parlour, I went outside to do some jogging. After thirteen minutes I went back inside.</p>
<p>The man didn't have it ready yet. He said, "I didn't trust you. I thought you wouldn't come back." So I waited there, and in five minutes he gave me a pie to take home.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was running while some of the girls were working in the Jharna-Kala Store. Since I know my disciples like baklava, I entered into a store that sold it and asked the man if he could cut twenty pieces in half. He said yes and started cutting. He had cut only two pieces when I told him I would be back. Then I ran a mile and a half.</p>
<p>When I returned, the man was surprised to see me. He said, "I am giving this to you for fifty cents less because I am so surprised to see you." In his case I was late, but he had it ready for me.</p>
<p>He asked me for ten dollars. I said to myself, "Each piece is 40 cents and there were twenty pieces." Fortunately, a lady standing behind me said to the man, "That should be eight dollars." The man said, "Oh, yes, yes. Sorry."</p>
<p>Now we come not to better but to best. Three weeks ago I received an anonymous letter deeply appreciating what I am doing for mankind, along with a bank check for one thousand dollars. It was a check from Citibank, but for some reason it had been mailed from Maine. So there are, indeed, good people on earth. This is how the world exists. Otherwise, the world would collapse.</p>

<p>Sometimes someone is ten or twenty metres ahead of you in a race. If you look at that person, you see that he is running so slowly. You can't believe that you are running slower than him, but you are.</p>
<p>In our last ten-mile race, two older women were running near me. Who will feel sorry for whom? But they finally went ahead of me, even though they seemed to be going so slowly, and I couldn't catch up to them again.</p>

<p>I will never allow the Centre to sponsor a race with the same kind of hilly course that we had in today's ten-mile race. Even my road crew driving alongside me in a car knew what we were going through. Each mile had at least one hill or even more, and there were three hills that were almost insurmountable.</p>
<p>When I saw one particular hill, my reaction was immediately to collapse. Then I saw two of my girl disciples running together in front of me, literally running and jumping up the hill.</p>
<p>I said, "If they can jump like that, why can't I drag my body up the hill?" And I did finally reach the top.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I was running by the Indian grocery near our old gym. An Indian family was standing beside the grocery. As I came by, a young boy of eight or ten began calling his mother, "Mom, look, Sri Chinmoy is running, Sri Chinmoy is running! We haven't seen him for a long time."</p>
<p>He called his mother, but I had disappeared before she could come out of the store.</p>

<p>He said to me, "I can beat you walking." I smiled at him. Then he started walking very fast for forty metres, but I was still a little ahead of him.</p>
<p>Then I told him, "<em>You</em> run. I can beat you walking."</p>
<p>So he started running and I started walking. I stayed behind him deliberately; otherwise, I could have easily defeated him.</p>
