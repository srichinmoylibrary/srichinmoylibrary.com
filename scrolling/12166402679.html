<p>I watch before I pray. I watch if there are undivine thoughts trying to assail my mind. Needless to say, I do not surrender to these undivine thoughts.</p>
<p>I watch before I pray. I watch if there are divine thoughts trying to inspire my heart. Needless to say, I welcome these thoughts with my open mind, open heart and open arms.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch and see if the jealous world is trying to rob me of the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, my conscious awareness prevents the jealous world from robbing me.</p>
<p>I pray, and then I watch. I watch to see if there are sincere seekers who would like to have the peace, light and bliss that I have acquired from my prayer. Needless to say, to them I immediately offer my peace, light and bliss devotedly, soulfully and unreservedly.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to change for the better: to have a better consciousness, better aspiration and a better realisation.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He expects me to become a more soulful instrument of His, Him to serve unconditionally in His own way.</p>
<p>God watches me pray. Through my prayer He wants me to become an unconditional seeker, an unconditional server and an unconditional lover.</p>
<p>Before God created this world, He watched and measured the ascendance of His Silence-Height. Now that God has created the world, He watches and measures the excellence of His Sound-Might.</p>
<p>I pray, I watch, I accept and, finally, I embrace the Feet of my Beloved Supreme with my heart's purity. God meditates, accepts and, finally, embraces my heart with his constant Self-giving Reality and Self-giving Divinity.</p>

<p>My Lord, my simple faith follows You. My Lord, my sincere love follows You. My Lord, my intense devotion follows You. My Lord, my unconditional surrender follows You.</p>
<p>My faith knows what You are. My love knows who You are. My devotion knows all about our closeness. My surrender knows all about our oneness. I know, my Lord, that when I do my best You do the rest for me compassionately, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>Why was I created? I was created to love You. Why was I created? I was created to need You. Why was I created? I was created to manifest You here on earth. Why was I created? I was created to be a perfect instrument of Yours, to please You in Your own way.</p>
<p>I have a secret, a supreme secret. I am at my journey's start, and the goal is still a far cry. Indeed, this is my inner conviction.</p>
<p>My Beloved Lord Supreme also has a secret, and this sweet secret He shares with me. He tells me that I am not at my journey's start but that I am at my journey's close; I am at my destination. But this destination of mine, unlike other destinations, is ever-transcending, ever-illumining and ever-fulfilling. At the destination the journey actually does not come to a close, for each destination is the starting point for a new journey. Therefore, I am always walking, marching and running along Eternity's Road, in the process of a new, illumining and fulfilling journey.</p>

<p>I appreciate, I admire, I adore and I love. I appreciate God the Power. I admire God the Light. I adore God the Delight. I love God the Compassion. Power is great. Light is good. Delight is immortal. Compassion is all-fulfilling. My God-appreciation multiplies my joy. My God-admiration multiplies my strength. My God-adoration multiplies my beauty, inner and outer. My God-love multiplies my satisfaction, within and without.</p>
<p>In the desire-world there was a time when I was a total failure. Nobody gave me a helping hand. I accepted my total failure, which was undoubtedly a blessing in disguise. Then I left the desire-world and entered into the aspiration-world. Here, at times, I am assailed by doubt, fear, teeming anxiety and worry. Yet sometimes I am also encouraged and inspired by the higher worlds of Light and Delight.</p>
<p>The world of desire separated me from the world of satisfaction. The world of aspiration, at the present state of my evolution, does not guarantee me abiding satisfaction. But there will come a time when I shall enter into the realisation-world, and my realisation-world — which will be founded upon my aspiration-world — <em>will</em> grant me everlasting joy and everlasting delight.</p>
<p>In the desire-world, when I failed, nobody blamed me. In the aspiration world, when I was half-successful and half a failure, the world around me did not care for me. But when I succeed in the realisation-world, the entire world will care for me, for the realisation-world is the world of oneness.</p>
<p>The desire-world is the world of division and possession, where each individual tries to lord it over others. In the aspiration-world fear and doubt and other negative ideas assail my human mind, and my aspiration is at times thwarted by undivine, unhealthy, uncomely forces. But the realisation-world, which is the world of inseparable, eternal and all-pervading oneness, can never be assailed by teeming doubts and negative forces. For this is the world of oneness and perfection, and inside perfection what looms large is satisfaction: satisfaction of the universal Soul, which the seeker in me embodies, and satisfaction of the transcendental Reality, which my seeker-life also embodies. It is only in the realisation-world that I can have satisfaction, and this satisfaction of mind I can share with my fellow-seekers, who are sailing in the same boat toward the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Success and progress</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Success and progress" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Confidence in myself I need. Assurance from God I need. Confidence tells me that eventually I can become a perfect instrument of God. Assurance tells me that this goal of mine is within my easy reach.</p>
<p>Confidence means to have the key to God's Kingdom. Assurance means to have the willingness and devotedness to open the door. Once I have opened the door, I see the face of success and feel the heart of progress.</p>
<p>Success is in the desire-world. Progress is in the aspiration-world. We succeed in life. We succeed in fulfilling our ambitions. But in outer success there is no assurance that we will be happy, even if we have great success, greater success and greatest success. Whereas with progress, even when we make just an iota of progress, we become happy, and our happiness is abiding.</p>
<p>Success belongs to our earth-consciousness. Progress belongs to our Heaven-consciousness. Success makes us feel that we have the capacity, that we can do everything. In success we feel that it is we who are the actual doers. Progress makes us feel that we are not the doers. It makes us feel that there is an unseen force deep within us that encourages and inspires our progress, and that inside this progress is our constant happiness. This unseen force is the doer; God is the doer. This is what we learn from our progress.</p>
<p>The seeker marches along the road of success, but that road ultimately fails to show him the destination. Then the seeker walks along the other road, progress. Here at every moment he meets with joy and satisfaction, for at every moment he sees a destination. Needless to say, this destination is only the starting point for a further, more illumining and more fulfilling goal.</p>
<p>Success makes the individual feel that might is right. So in the world of success, the individual human being comes first and God comes next. This is what success tells us. But progress tells us that might is God's Compassion and right is also God's Compassion. Progress also tells us something else most significant: God is first and God is last; in between is the seeker's place.</p>
<p>Man finds his eternal place between God the Leader and God the Follower. God the Leader and God the Follower grant him a place in the inmost recesses of the Universal Heart. In this place, the seeker at every moment sees that God the Leader and God the Follower are taking him to his destination, where he will become one with the transcendental Vision and the universal Reality that he has been longing for throughout Eternity.</p>

<p>Our human life is not a bitter complaint. Our human life is not a serious problem. Our human life is not a heavy burden. Our human life is not a deplorable failure.</p>
<p>Our human life is a God-inspired aspiration-journey. Our human life is a God-intoxicated dedication-road. Our human life is a God-fulfilling manifestation-song. Our human life is a God-satisfying perfection-mission.</p>
<p>Our divine life is not a mental hallucination. Our divine life is not an escape from the hard realities of the world. Our divine life is not the total negation or destruction of our earthly life.</p>
<p>Our divine life is the only true reality. Our divine life sings the song of the Infinite inside the very life-breath of the finite.</p>
<p>Our human life is Time's possibility-seed. Our divine life is Eternity's inevitability-tree.</p>
<p>Our human life is the flowering of our love, devotion and surrender. Our divine life is God's supreme Victory in and through us.</p>

<p>What shall I make of myself today? I shall make of myself a simplicity-life, a sincerity-heart, a humility-mind, a purity-vital and a luminosity-body. Simplicity will reduce my possession-necessity. Sincerity will multiply my God-necessity. Humility will connect me with Heaven's true reality. Purity will expand my heart's length and breadth. And inside my luminosity, my heart's inner cry will constantly see an ever-transcending, ever-illumining and ever-fulfilling dawn.</p>
<p>What shall I make of myself tomorrow? Tomorrow I shall make of myself an unconditional seeker, an unconditional lover and an unconditional server. The seeker in me will always cry. The lover in me will always smile. The server in me will always cry, smile and, at the same time, gain perfect perfection.</p>
<p>It is at God's choice Hour that I can give up my human life, as previously I gave up my animal life. For me the Hour of God has struck. Now is the choice Hour for me to enter into the divine life. But the divine life will not negate my human life; far from it. It will only change, transform and illumine my human life. Inside my human life teeming desires assailed my mind. But now I shall embrace the aspiration life, the life of inner cry. Here I shall cry not for name or fame or earthly possessions, but for the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. My only goal is to sit at His Feet, Him to please in His own way at every moment. Darkness I have, and my darkness I shall place at His Feet. An iota of light I have, and this iota of light I shall place at His Feet. I have an inner cry, an insignificant inner cry, and this inner cry I shall place at His Feet. I have a fleeting soulful smile. This soulful smile, although it is fleeting, I shall place at His Feet. My earth-bound expectation, my Heaven-free satisfaction, both I shall place at His Feet.</p>
<p>The human in me, the divine in me, the animal in me I shall place at the Feet of my Beloved Supreme. He will utilise the divine in me to manifest Himself in His own way. The human in me also He will utilise to manifest Himself here on earth in His own way. The animal in me — which is doubt, jealousy, insecurity, impurity and so forth — He will utilise again in His own way. Everything that I have, everything that I am, my Beloved Supreme will use, Himself to serve in His own way. I shall be only an instrument, an unconditional instrument, of my Beloved Supreme, Him to please in His own way, here on earth and there in Heaven. In the desire-world, in the aspiration-world, in the experience-world, in the realisation-world and, finally, in the oneness-world I shall please Him, my Beloved Supreme, always in His own way, always.</p>
