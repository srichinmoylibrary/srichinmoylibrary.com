<p>When I was in Hawaii, I went to a cafeteria. I took a tray and went on line for some food. I came to the section where they have mashed potatoes. But instead of saying "mashed potatoes," I asked for "potatoes mashed." I thought I was saying it correctly and that the lady behind the counter had not heard me. I was very brave. When she asked me again what I wanted, I repeated it. Then she said, "Are you upside down?"</p>

<p>At one store in Hawaii the lady was so nice. I wanted to buy a Polaroid camera. It cost ten dollars. But the saleslady said, "Don't buy it unless you can get film for it. We are all out of film, but you can look around. If you find the film, then come back and buy the camera."</p>
<p>Ashrita went to four or five stores, but he couldn't get any film. He came back and told me. The lady said, "I told you! What is the use of buying a camera if you can't get film?" If it had been somewhere else, they would have said, "Buy the camera here and then look for film somewhere else."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Father, husband and brother</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Father, husband and brother" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I entered into another store, I saw an elderly lady who was about fifty or fifty-five years old. As soon as I opened the door, she came and stood behind me and started patting my back, saying, "You remind me of my father, husband and brother."</p>
<p>Immediately my heart surrendered to her. I asked her a few questions. She said she was Japanese and that her father, husband and brother had died in the Second World War. Her husband used to work in the post office.</p>
<p>While she was patting me, she said, "You are serene, pure and full of peace, peace, peace, peace." She said "peace" at least four or five times.</p>
<p>I bought from her store a suitcase with wheels on the bottom. It was nine dollars or something like that, and I gave her a twenty dollar bill. She did not ring it up on the cash register. Instead she took the twenty dollar bill from me and put it inside my bag. So I took it out of the bag and gave it to her again and said, "You have made a mistake."</p>
<p>At that time her daughter came over. She was very angry and upset and she rang up the sale on the register. The mother then took the exact amount out of her pocket and put it in the register.</p>
<p>The daughter was puzzled.</p>
<p>The mother said, "He reminds me of my father, husband and brother. Of late I am seeing my dear ones quite often." What could I say? Inwardly I was telling her, "Perhaps your time has come to join them." But if I told her outwardly, her daughter would be mad. Since the lady was so nice, I wandered around and got a few more things. The lady said to me, "Had it been my store, I would not have charged you at all. But I am only an employee here."</p>
<p>Then, when I was leaving the store, she followed me out to the door in such an affectionate way. Tears were visible in her eyes.</p>

<p>In one store I saw a beautiful stuffed animal, but I could not figure out if it was a cow or a dog. It had a bell around the neck. I was going to buy it for Samarpana.</p>
<p>Before I bought it, I said to one of the salesladies, "I like it very much; it is white and very nice. But is it a cow?"</p>
<p>She laughed at me and said, "No, a dog!"</p>
<p>It was very beautiful, and it looked like a cow.</p>

<p>The other day I went shopping and I bought a few things. At one store I asked a saleslady for a shopping bag. She said I had to pay twenty cents extra.</p>
<p>I asked, "Are you Hawaiian or Japanese?"</p>
<p>She said, "I am Japanese, and I am sorry I asked you for twenty cents extra."She gave me the bag and wouldn't take the twenty cents from me. Afterwards, I got a few more things. As I was going out, she followed me and said very fast, "I am sorry."</p>

<p>Three or four days ago I went to Woolworth's to buy a bag. I was standing in line behind a little girl around six or seven years old. She was with her brother, who was about four or five.</p>
<p>The little boy said to his sister, "Jeannie," - or something like that - "if you have ten cents, can you give it to me?"</p>
<p>She said, "No!"</p>
<p>Then the boy said, "Didn't you hear me say 'if,' 'if,' 'if'? I said, 'If you have, if you have!'</p>
<p>Again she said, "No!"</p>
<p>Then he said, "Damn you!"</p>
<p>The girl bought a roll of thick string. It came to $1.36. She only had $1.30. So when she gave $1.30 to the lady at the register, the lady at the register said, "O my God, O my God," looking at the manager. How could she give the girl the string when the actual price was six cents more?</p>
<p>Immediately I took out a dollar and gave it to the little girl, so she was very happy. The lady at the register said to her, "Say 'thank you' to the gentleman." But the girl didn't say anything. Then from the change I gave a dime to the little boy. He grabbed it from me. The woman behind the register, who was about 23 or 25 years old, said to him, "Little one, say 'thank you'." He also wouldn't say it. So the woman said to the little girl, "What kind of parents do you have? I am ashamed of you." Then she said to me, "On their behalf I am thanking you. It's a shame that parents don't teach their children the 'thank you' business!"</p>

<p>We entered into a store to buy some prasad. There were so many posters with pictures of me there. In so many ways X was trying to let the store owner know that I was the one on the poster, but he was in his own world. Just behind him was a poster where I was playing the esraj.</p>

<p>There is a bookstore in Jamaica where I like to buy things. The previous owner was very bad. He used to suspect everyone. Every time I would enter into the store, I had to leave my bag outside. You weren't allowed to bring your bags inside. The owner looked like President Truman. I would always say jokingly to myself, "Truman has incarnated again."</p>
<p>When I went into the store a few days ago, I left my bag outside as I always do. It was raining, but what could I do? Then I went inside. A half hour I spent there. I bought a dictionary for a dollar. Then I saw Shakespeare's Hamlet. I wanted to buy the whole Shakespeare set. The man was so nice. He was looking for the other books, but he could not find them. He said he would have them ready for me the next time-38 volumes.</p>
<p>I said, "Next week I will come."</p>
<p>He said, "You will get the books."</p>
<p>He was looking at me. Then he said, "It seems you are Sri Chinmoy. I can feel the fragrance from your body." He was saying he was so honoured that I had come into his store.</p>
<p>Then I was looking for my bag. It was on the shelf inside. The man had taken it from outside and put it on the shelf. He said, "Why did you leave it outside?"</p>
<p>I said, "The previous owner used to suspect me." I told him how nice he was and how bad the previous owner was.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to see A. off at the airport. She likes to read newspapers and magazines, so while she was standing at the ticket desk, I went to buy her The <em>New York Times,</em> Newsweek and <em>People</em> magazine. There was a teenager working at the counter. I gave her a twenty dollar bill. My purchase came to over four dollars, so she gave me back three five dollar bills and some change. Then she said very haughtily, "I don't have a ten dollar bill!" She said it as if I had asked her to give me a ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>I said, "It doesn't matter, so long as you have given me the proper change." Then I saw two cute writing pads that said "I love New York" with a heart sign. I said to myself, "I really love New York. It has given me shelter. No other place has given me shelter like this."</p>
<p>I went up to the girl with the pads. I was standing in front of her, and she was about to press the register. Suddenly I got the inspiration to buy cookies for A. and Savyasachi. Then she got mad at me. Nobody was behind me. Only one other person was browsing in the store; that's all. I said, "What's the difference if I come back or if another customer comes? Can't you take me as another customer?"</p>
<p>She said to me, "Oh, I didn't think of it."</p>

<p>Last night after the public meditation at PS 86, I gave a flower arrangement to one of the seekers who came up for prasad. A few years ago that particular gentleman was taking a meditation course that Dhrubha was giving. He appreciated Dhrubha's course like anything. Poor Dhrubha, once in a blue moon he gets appreciation! So this man's appreciation was like a full moon.</p>
<p>About four days ago I went to Lucille's Diner with six or seven visiting disciples. When I sat down, this particular man wanted to come over and say hello to me. But Databir stood up and prevented him from approaching me. I looked at the man through the corner of my eye and saw that he was a very nice, very soulful man. So I approached him and said hello to him.</p>
<p>He was so moved. Immediately he showed me his key-chain which had my picture on it. It was one of my smiling pictures. When he spoke to me, he addressed me as "Guru."</p>
<p>I asked him what he does for a living. He is a fire marshal. We exchanged just a few words, and I invited him to come to our Wednesday night meditations if it was at all possible. Afterwards, he talked to Databir for a few minutes, and then he left. I wasn't paying any attention when he left. We were just sitting and eating.</p>
<p>When the time came for me to pay the bill, the waitress informed me that the man had paid it. He had told her that he was very happy that he could take care of it. That is why last night, when he came to our Wednesday night public meditation, I gave him flowers. Now today I heard that after the meeting he said he would like to become a disciple.</p>

<p>The previous day there was another funny incident. There is a donut shop on Jamaica Avenue next to another store that has burned to the ground. It is near the Long Island Railroad station. They have four or five kinds of donuts there. I asked them for ten egg salad sandwiches. The man said to me, "Ten? Ten? How about five?"</p>
<p>While he was making everything, I asked another worker if she could give me a Tab and a donut. This is how I follow my diet! You won't believe it, but I have lost eight and a half pounds since the 15-mile race. This is solid weight loss - not water weight. I ran and took exercise; I worked very hard. When I started, I was 146 1/2 pounds. When I got on the scale, I cried. Then, after running the 15-mile race, I gained two and a half or three pounds, as usual. But now my weight is back down to 138, or even a little less. So it is possible for everyone to lose weight!</p>
<p>Anyway, I finished my food, and what did I see? A black man entered the store. He was wearing an expensive suit and was very well dressed. At that time it was around twelve-thirty or one o'clock. The man ordered something and ate it. He gave a ten dollar bill to the owner, but he did not get as much change as he was expecting. The owner just pointed to the price list.</p>
<p>The customer said, "No, you have to give me more change!"</p>
<p>The owner said, "From six to eleven in the morning there is one price. After eleven, the price changes." The customer said, "I would not have eaten if I had seen that."</p>
<p>The owner said, "You have to pay for what you have eaten."</p>
<p>A real argument started, and I was standing right between them. There was a container of milk on the counter. One of them accidentally struck it, and it spilled all over. Both the black man and I jumped away from the counter.</p>
<p>Then I said, "Please, please, I am ready to give the fifty cents."</p>
<p>The customer was so embarrassed that he said to the owner, "Hell with you!" and walked out.</p>
<p>The owner turned to me and said, "Please tell me who was right?"</p>
<p>I said, "You were right!"</p>
<p>The man grabbed my hand and with his other hand he grabbed two donuts and put them in my other hand.</p>
<p>He said, "You don't have to pay a cent for these."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't want the donuts." So he put them into my bag. This is how I got two donuts free. Of course, if the owner had asked me who was right while the other man was in the store, I would have said to him, "Do I understand your English?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Honeybread</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Honeybread" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today in the bakery I bought a loaf of bread. I don't appreciate bread at all, but some of my disciples like it. The sign said "honeybread," so I asked the girl behind the counter, "Is there honey inside, or is it just a name?"</p>
<p>The girl said, "I don't know." So she went to her boss, an elderly lady.</p>
<p>The boss said, "It has honey inside."</p>
<p>How they put honey inside the bread, God knows!</p>
