<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I admire this wisdom most soulfully. If I am doing something wrong, if all at once I cannot stop, then I will stop little by little. If I tell lies ten times a day, then I shall take an oath that from tomorrow I will tell lies only nine times a day. The day after tomorrow I will lie only seven times, and the following day only six times. Like that gradually, gradually it will become zero. If I increase my lying, I will feel miserable. But if I start decreasing and decreasing my bad habits, then I will feel some satisfaction.</p>
<p>Here also, if every month I have been making a certain number of weapons, then I will gradually make fewer and fewer and fewer. Then in six months or one year or two years, I will completely stop. This is the most effective way to rectify my mistakes. Slowly and steadily I will come to the right path.</p>
<p>Another thing also I can do. If I have done something wrong to you, I shall try to compensate for the damage that I have caused. But compensation in itself is not enough. I must do something on the strength of my sympathy and oneness so that you will not only be happy but actually forgive me. I must do more than just stop doing this thing. I have to do something to rectify it, so I give you as much as I can to make you feel that I have established my oneness with you.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things that America and Japan are doing together, and it gives them such joy. For example, Japan invites American runners to come to its friendship race. The whole world is running-either running towards destruction or running towards perfection. When the Japanese and Americans run together on Friendship Day, it is a great achievement. Both parties have forgotten their rivalry and animosity, and they are running as friends. So let this friendship increase from one day to two days. Gradually let it become 365 days of friendship and then another 365 days. If we have established friendship, how can there be any dispute, any quarrel, any fight, any war?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we can pay not only more attention but all attention to peace, then we can try to avoid it. We can't deny that the danger exists, but we can easily avoid it. If there is a hurdle, we shall try to surmount it or we shall take another direction, which is the direction of peace. The world is now talking about destruction, but we are talking about peace. According to our capacity, God is utilising us to spread peace all over the world. So let each of us spread peace according to our capacity. We know that people are threatening to set fire to our building. But if we keep the building strong, we are well protected. Similarly, while the danger of war threatens us, if we can inundate the world with love and peace, that love will prove stronger than the strongest, and war itself will be destroyed.</p>
<p>God is all Love, and inside Love is infinite Power. So if I can bring forward my love and if you can bring forward your love, then our love-power will definitely silence this destruction-power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! In bygone days hero-warriors used to fight with one another. Civilians and innocent people did not come into the picture. If you wanted to fight, you issued a challenge and fought. But those who didn't believe in fighting, those who wanted to remain peaceful, were not bothered. Now war is like a mad elephant. A mad elephant doesn't know who is an innocent bystander and who is the enemy. It just destroys.</p>
<p>Previously, warfare was like a contest between two boxers. A boxer is not going to come out into the street to hurt people. A wrestler is not going to go out into the street to throw people into the air. A wrestler will fight with other wrestlers. A boxer will fight with other boxers. But now, innocent people who have nothing to do with boxing or wrestling are being destroyed. It is so ridiculous, so painful!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are a man of infinite wisdom and light. At every moment sleeplessly you are trying to offer light to ignorant people. Ignorant people must realise that they need light from people who have light. If I am ignorant, I don't want to remain always ignorant. If somebody in the family knows something, then I have to learn from him. You know something. Now your dear ones, your friends and your countrymen must learn from you. There are many students in a class but only one teacher. One teacher speaks, and hundreds of students learn. Then again, each of these students can go to another place and talk about what he has learned of peace and love. In this way hundreds and thousands can learn. So from one it becomes many. But at one point someone has to start the whole thing. One individual has to offer peace before it will spread to two or three. So people like you must be given the opportunity to spread your light, and this is what you are doing.</p>
<p>I am extremely, extremely happy and fortunate to be here with you, and I am extremely, extremely grateful to you for translating this pamphlet. So you can feel my heart of gratitude.</p>

<p><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> Thank you very much. Can I keep this?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! This is for you. I am offering this with my heart's infinite gratitude. We are two brothers sailing in the same boat.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> You will live longer than I will, but I am so honoured to hear that. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But no matter where you are, your soul will bless us. You may not be in the body, but from Heaven you will bless humanity. You have been blessing humanity for 80 years, and I pray that you will continue to bless humanity for at least 20 more years. In India we talk about people living 100 years. I understand you are 80. So I pray that for at least 20 more years you will be in the physical to bless the world.</p>
<p>Again, it is not age that matters but the inspiration, aspiration and dedication that you are showing. This dynamism of yours will spread all over the world. This is most important. Otherwise, people live to a ripe old age, but they do nothing for mankind. In your case, at every moment you are serving humanity. So every second of yours on earth is so precious. I am a lover of peace and you are also a lover of peace. We are in the same boat, The Japanese are blessed to have you here.</p>
<p>Meeting you has been a very memorable experience for me.</p>

<p><em>(While the song was performed, Sri Chinmoy offered a gift to Mr. Matsumoto and, in return, Mr. Matsumoto presented a plaque to Sri Chinmoy.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> Thank you very much. I am very grateful. Before I left for Shikoku, a friend of mine told me about a man who lives in the heart as I do, and my friend invited me to go to a concert to see this man. While Sri Chinmoy performed on 10 different instruments at Bunka Geijutsu Kaikan Hall, I was deeply moved. It was a most mystical experience for me.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that the lives of the Japanese people are maybe a little too hectic and a little too busy. It is necessary for us to meditate inwardly once in a while to transform ourselves.</p>
<p>I am truly delighted to have Sri Chinmoy here with us as our special guest today. Transcending all nationalities, we are one in heart and soul.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>24.</h2>

<p><em>On December 18, 1985 Sri Chinmoy met with Mr. Toshihiko Seko, Japan's champion marathon runner, and his manager, Mr. Shoichi Kobayashi, in Tokyo. Following are excerpts from their conversation.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to offer my soul's deepest gratitude to our Brother-Father-Mentor-Coach, Nakamura. While he was on earth, he wanted his dearest Seko to offer to the world something unique. I am sure that in the soul's world he has the same vision-that his dearest student-son should offer something most extraordinary to the world at large.</p>
<p>His departure is extremely significant. According to Indian philosophy, water means consciousness: water signifies consciousness infinite. His soul came from Infinity and has again gone back to Infinity. From the infinite Consciousness he appeared on the earth plane to inspire the running world to become more perfect and to do many, many other extraordinary things not only for his beloved Japan but for the whole world.</p>
<p>Here we are remembering and we shall always remember our dearest Nakamura, our Brother-Father-Teacher-Friend, with our heart's boundless gratitude. His wisdom, his compassion, his love and his feeling of oneness for his students, especially Seko, for his dear, intimate ones and for the whole world, will always be treasured by us all. Now we are invoking his soul and praying to bring down his soul's presence to bless us all with his boundless Peace, Light and Delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now that he is in the soul's world, he has much more Power, Love and Light than he had when he was in the physical. So he is able to achieve many more things than he was able to achieve when he was in the body. The body has limited capacities; the soul has unlimited capacities. So his soul's unlimited capacities he is offering to his students. His blessings from Heaven he is sending to his students.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> I would like to thank you for these kind words. As long as the runners follow Mr. Nakamura's spirit and feel that he is protecting them from Above, they will be able to continue with their effort and do very well.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I also feel exactly the same. As long as they offer their love and gratitude to their Sensei-Teacher-Brother-Friend, he will offer them Heavenly blessings. And these Heavenly blessings will become their most astonishing achievements.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Seko: I am sure that Mr. Nakamura, my Sensei&#039;s soul, is blessing us from Heaven. I feel that his blessings are raining down. It is a fact that he is no longer here on earth and now is the time for me to look into the future. I would like to remember and follow what my Sensei has taught me and become an even greater person than he was.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real father gets tremendous joy and satisfaction only when he sees that his son, his student, has surpassed him. If the father goes only to high school and then he sees his son going to college and learning much more than he has learned, he gets tremendous joy. Always the younger generation has to surpass the older generation; that is evolution. Someone achieves something, and his son goes far beyond his achievement. With Mr. Nakamura's blessings, Seko will go beyond him; and with Seko's blessings, the young generation will go beyond him. This is the message of the Beyond. I am very happy to hear this.</p>
<p>Now I would like my students to sing several songs for you.</p>

<p><em>(Singers perform songs by Sri Chinmoy dedicated to Nakamura, including three songs to Nakamura's words.)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (to Seko):</em> How is your married life? You should have brought your wife here. There are so many of our girls here whom she could have met. Does she run?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Yes. She won the corporate relay for the S &amp; B company. I am the so-called coach for the runners because my ankle has been injured.</p>
<p>/Sri Chinmoy: When are you going to run a marathon again?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> I am going to run a race next spring. Next year I will run possibly two marathons.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Will you run in Fukuoka?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> I haven't decided on which marathons, but I will run two.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> Mr. Shintaku of our team won the Fukuoka Marathon on December 1st in 2:09:51.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> See how Mr. Nakamura's soul's blessings are working. <em>Mr. Kobayashi:</em> Mr. Seko and Mr. Shintaku are rivals from the same team.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But didn't something happen during that marathon and you could have done better?</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> Once towards the end of the Fukuoka Marathon I was ready to do a 100-metre dash to pass Ikangaa.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In one marathon you took off your hat.</p>
<p><em>Seko:</em> When I threw off my hat during the Los Angeles Olympic marathon, at that time the temperature had gone down and I felt cooler. That is why I took it off.</p>
