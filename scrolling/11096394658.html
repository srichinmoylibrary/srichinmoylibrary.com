<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I feel that the world needs dynamism. The outer world needs dynamism and the inner world needs peace. As seekers, we have to pray and meditate in order to have peace. Again, if we can be dynamic, then we will be able to accomplish much in our outer life. To be dynamic we need physical fitness at every moment, and running helps us considerably to keep physically fit. Also, running reminds us of our eternal journey in which we walk, march and run along Eternity’s Road to our eternal Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the spiritual purpose of competitive sports?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the spiritual purpose of competitive sports?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our aim is not to become the world’s best athlete. Our aim is to keep the body fit, to develop dynamism and to give the vital innocent joy. Our aim should not be to surpass others, but to constantly surpass our own previous achievements. We cannot properly evaluate our own capacity unless we have some standard of comparison. Therefore, we compete not for the sake of defeating others but in order to bring forward our own capacity. Our best capacity comes forward only when there are other people around us. They inspire us to bring forward our utmost capacity, and we inspire them to bring forward their utmost capacity. This is why we have competitive sports.</p>
<p>Always there should be a goal. Having a goal does not mean that we have to try to defeat the world’s top runners, far from it. In the spiritual life, our goal should be our own progress. Progress itself is the most illumining experience. If we want to make progress, and if somebody else is with us, immediately his mind or our mind may think that we are competing. In the ordinary life we compete with others to gain supremacy. But in the spiritual life, we are not in competition with others. We are only trying to transcend our own capacity.</p>
<p>We can think of ourselves as two halves. One half is our imperfection and the other is our sincere cry for perfection. One side is weakness and the other side is strength. With our inner cry for perfection, let us run towards our destination and reach the illumination-shore. When our being is fully illumined, then dark, ignorant forces are afraid to come near us. Before we reach the destination, they challenge us. But once we reach the illumination-destination, the ignorant forces do not dare enter into us because they feel that they will be totally destroyed. They do not know that they will only be transformed and illumined.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one is a seeker-athlete, then before he enters into physical activity, he should offer a few moments of gratitude to his Inner Pilot for inspiring him to become an athlete. An athlete is he who runs, who values time, who values speed and who believes in a goal that ever moves forward. There are millions and billions of people on earth who are not athletes, whereas he is. If he can offer his gratitude for that, then he increases his receptivity-power. If he increases his receptivity-power, automatically he increases his athletic capacity. Receptivity increases capacity, and the only way one can increase receptivity is to offer a gratitude-heart for what one has already become.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To a great extent, speed in running starts with the mind. You have to develop more imagination. Imagine that you are running fast and appreciate your speed. Then let the thrill and joy that you get from your imagination inundate you. This joy will increase your speed. You can also think of some people who really do run fast and try to identify yourself with them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can prevent training from becoming tedious and boring if we keep in mind that running is nothing short of a newly-blossomed flower which we are placing each day at the Feet of our Beloved Supreme. We have to feel that this newly-blossomed flower is our soul’s daily awakening, a self-giving reality that each day we are offering to our Beloved Supreme. If we can maintain this experience while running, then we will never find our training tedious or boring.</p>
<p>Another way to sustain freshness and enthusiasm in our training is to have a clear, meaningful and fruitful goal. If we keep in mind this meaningful and fruitful goal, then enthusiasm and freshness will automatically dawn. If we value the goal, then the goal itself will give us enthusiasm and freshness. We are not aware of our goal’s conscious eagerness to help us reach it. We think that the goal that is ahead of us is indifferent to us. If we can come to it, well and good; if we cannot come to it, the goal is not going to come to us. We feel that the goal is something stationary. But it is not like that. In the case of a spiritual seeker, the goal is always progressive and this progressive goal is more than eager to help us.</p>
<p>The mother will stand at a particular place and wait for the child to come crawling or running towards her. But the mother is not only passively waiting and observing; she also has tremendous eagerness for the child to reach her. If the mother sees that the child is trying but not succeeding, she will come running towards the child. Similarly, in the inner world, the goal actually comes towards the runner. If we value the goal and feel that the goal is something worthwhile, if we feel that it has boundless things to offer us, then naturally the goal itself will inwardly help us. The goal does not want us always to feel that it is a far cry; it wants us to reach it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your running capacity changes every day because every day you are in a different consciousness. One day you feel light. One day you feel heavy. One day you feel inspiration and another day you feel no inspiration. On a slow day, if you want to maintain the same joy that you have when you are running well, you can play a trick on yourself. Imagine that instead of being forced to run at a slower pace, you decided to run at that pace. If you feel that it is you who commanded your body to go at such a slow pace, then you will not feel miserable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is always a reason, either in the inner world or in the outer world. In the inner world, if something is dislocated — if your consciousness has descended or if some hostile forces have attacked — you get an injury. Sometimes you are totally innocent, but the wrong forces, the malicious forces which are hovering around, can cause injury.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes in the inner world or in the thought-world you have done something wrong, and this can also cause an injury. Thought can be more destructive than a hydrogen bomb. Wrong thoughts, which are so destructive, may come and attack you, especially your physical, which is in ignorance most of the time. The wrong forces find it very easy to attack the plane which is fast asleep, because they will encounter no opposition there.</p>
<p>So, in the inner world either your consciousness has descended because of wrong thoughts, or some hostile force has attacked you, and that is why you get an injury which you cannot see any reason for.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from Above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether.</p>
<p>If you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from Above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If you just casually say, “Oh, how I wish I didn’t have any pain!" that will be useless.</p>
<p>Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago, perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, do not think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are competing only against yourself.</p>
<p>Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor. But in some cases there is no way to cure the pain.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should try to invoke Light in order to cure pain. Pain is, after all, a kind of darkness within us. When the inner Light or the Light from Above starts functioning in the pain itself, then the pain is removed or transformed into joy. Really advanced seekers can actually feel joy in the pain itself. But for that, one has to be very highly advanced. In your case, during your prayer or meditation you should try to bring down Light from Above and feel that the pain is a darkness within you. If you bring down Light, then the pain will either be illumined and transformed or removed from your system.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do pain and suffering aid our spiritual life by purifying it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do pain and suffering aid our spiritual life by purifying it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a general notion that if we go through suffering, tribulations and physical pain, then our system will be purified. This idea is not founded upon reality. There are many people who are suffering because of their past karma or because undivine forces are attacking them, but we cannot say that they are nearing their destination. No! They have to aspire more sincerely in order to reach their destination. We shall not welcome pain; we shall try to conquer pain if it appears. If we can take pain as an experience, then we can try to transform it into joy by our own identification with joy, which we then try to bring into the pain itself.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go through suffering before we can enter into the Kingdom of Delight. Many people have realised God through love. The Father has love for the child and the child has love for the Father. This love takes us to our goal. Our philosophy emphasises the positive way of approaching Truth. We have limited light; now let us increase it. Let us progress from more light to abundant light to infinite Light.</p>
<p>The highest discovery is this: We came from Delight, we are in Delight, we grow in Delight and at the end of our journey's close, we shall retire into Delight.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we go deep within, we see that it is the limited ‘I’, the ego, that suffers. The unlimited T does not suffer. He who wants to bind reality suffers. But he who wants to free and liberate the reality within himself will not suffer.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that what we call suffering is not at all suffering in God’s Eye. It is an experience that He is having in and through us. If we live in God's Consciousness, then no matter what happens in our life, we will feel that it is only an experience that our Beloved Supreme is having in and through us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you run through inner pain?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you run through inner pain?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I cannot place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded.</p>
<p>If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you do not go out to run, then you are just a fool.</p>
<p>If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression.</p>
