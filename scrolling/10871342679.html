<p>I went into a video store and said, "I would like to buy a nice, spiritual Hindi movie."</p>
<p>The shopkeeper said, "For you, it will be free."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't take anything free."</p>
<p>He said, "We sell it for $12. For you, $10."</p>
<p>I said, "Fine."</p>
<p>There was one movie named "Trishul." I said, "I have a student named Trishul, so I will take this one."</p>
<p>The man said, "Oh no, Swamiji. That is not for you!"</p>
<p>See how nice the shopkeeper was. He knew that it was a romantic movie. He was sincere.</p>

<p>I went down to the lobby of our hotel in Quebec City to do some shopping. I bought lots of things, and it came to $115. I asked the lady, "Do you accept American money?"</p>
<p>She said, "Oh, sure."</p>
<p>I asked her to convert the total cost from Canadian dollars into American dollars.</p>
<p>She said, "It is $165."</p>
<p>I said, "How can it be?"</p>
<p>She said, "This is what the register says."</p>
<p>I was laughing, and she was getting mad at me. She asked me to wait for her supervisor.</p>
<p>I said, "I am ready to wait for your supervisor."</p>
<p>When he came, the supervisor apologised to me. He said, "She has just joined us. She doesn't know the difference between Canadian and American money."</p>
<p>Then, when the supervisor converted the cost, it became $85.</p>

<p>I went to a restaurant in Hawaii that lets you take whatever you want for a fixed price of $4.75. They had twenty items to choose from.</p>
<p>When I got to the cash register, the lady placed her hand on my shoulder and asked, "Are you going to pile your plate still higher?"</p>
<p>The plate was so small! Out of twenty items, I won't take a little of each? Saraswati was behind me, but she didn't have the heart to insult the lady.</p>

<p>Then he told me that I have a very big heart.</p>
<p>I bought $70 or $80 worth of books, and he had to tell me that only if I paid for my book would he be able to buy two more of my books!</p>

<p>He asked me, "Why are you giving me this?"</p>
<p>I said, "You gave me advice for so long."</p>
<p>Then Savyasachi told him, "It is an Indian custom. The first customer gives money to the shopkeeper."</p>
<p>Afterwards, I told Savyasachi that it is just the opposite: It is the shopkeeper who gives a good price to the first customer of the day for good luck. In India you can go into a store at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and they still say you are the first customer.</p>

<p>About a month ago I was in a store on 148th Street. The Spanish-speaking owner of the shop was trying to sell me a clock, but the clock was not working. He was telling me, "It will work at home."</p>
<p>I said, "Here it does not work, but it will work at home?"</p>
<p>He said, "Here I have not tried to fix it. But you have many people who can fix it for you. Then it will work."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I won't buy it if it is not working."</p>
<p>He said, "Then don't come into my shop anymore!"</p>
<p>I said, "Fine, I will not come into your shop."</p>
<p>Four or five days ago I happened to pass him on the street. He invited me to come into his shop, but I said no.</p>

<p>It was raining heavily and I entered a little Chinese store where they sell all kinds of things. The owners were an old man and woman from Shanghai, who spoke broken English.</p>
<p>I was browsing and buying presents for some people. Then I stood on line to pay. Ahead of me were a few people.</p>
<p>A tall, young black man was standing by the register; his charge came to around $17. He handed the lady a bill and said very abruptly, "Keep the change." Then he quickly left the store.</p>
<p>The lady looked at the bill and saw that it was only a ten-dollar bill, not a twenty-dollar bill, so she came from behind the counter and ran after him, shouting and screaming in Chinese. Her husband also ran after him. But the man had his car right outside, and he just jumped in and drove away.</p>
<p>Everybody felt very sad. When I came up to the cash register, my charge came to $93. I wanted to give the old woman $7 extra to make up for what the black man had done, but she did not want to take it.</p>
<p>I said, "But you are not charging me tax."</p>
<p>She said, "Oh no, I can't." I insisted and finally she took it. Then she pushed a little toy car across the counter and said, "This is for your children"So I was nice to her, and she was nice to me.</p>

<p>They didn't know English and I didn't know Japanese, but they were saying so many things to me!</p>
