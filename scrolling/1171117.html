<h2>On Mother Goddess Mahalakshmi</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have worshipped the Mother Goddess Mahalakshmi, who is an aspect of the Transcendental Mother Absolute. Mother Lakshmi is the Mother of beauty, harmony, plenitude, prosperity and infinitude. She is the Mother of Compassion infinite. She is the only Mother who can and will be patiently, compassionately and eternally ready to walk — if necessity demands, even crawl — with the slower than the slowest child to reach the destination.</p>
<p>Mahalakshmi is the Mother of affection, Mother of fondness, plus Mother of, to a great extent, indulgence. At every moment from the earth-consciousness She expects only one thing: harmony, harmony, harmony. Disharmony tortures Her creation-heart. Therefore, She always expects harmony in Her human children. Her Lotus-Consciousness-Heart Universal is for all, specially for those who are weak, slow, unfortunate and deplorable in various aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>Some of the Cosmic Goddesses are worshipped only by the brave. They also have Compassion, but their standard is very lofty. They expect or demand a certain amount of self-discipline. And according to the evolution, according to the progress of each individual seeker, they demand self-giving, more self-giving and most self-giving. But Mother Lakshmi is for all. Her message is: “I am ready; I shall always remain ready. No harm if you are weak, no harm if you are slow. You are My child. You can claim Me and do claim Me as your own, very own. My sweet, sweeter, sweetest children, come to Me with what you have and come to Me with what you do not have. I shall give you My Heart’s bounty. You just come to Me with your purity, with your impurity, with your strength, with your weakness, with your willingness. And if you fail to bring Me your willingness, just come, come to Me, even with your unwillingness. I shall transform your unwillingness into willingness, your weakness into strength, your impurity into purity. Your insufficiency in your heart, in your mind, in your vital and in your body will be replaced by My Heart of Plenitude and My Transcendental Vision and My Universal Reality of Infinitude.</p>

SCA 646-655. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Honolulu, Hawaii on 19 and 23 December 1990.</p>
<h2>Question: How can America awaken?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The simplicity-mind of a child, the sincerity-heart of a child, the purity-life of a child — only these three things can awaken America.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately it does. But if a sincere seeker, on the strength of his sleepless love of God, can establish a free access to the constant newness, freshness and fulness of God’s infinite Light and Delight, then the weaknesses and limitations of age can be surmounted, and the seeker will get the message-light to go beyond age.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible for mountain climbers to conquer altitude sickness spiritually?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible for mountain climbers to conquer altitude sickness spiritually?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely, if the mountain climber is a spiritual person, he can conquer altitude sickness spiritually. How? As I always say, imagination is a world of its own. You can imagine that different altitudes are like succeeding steps of a ladder. When you step on the first step of a ladder, definitely you get joy. Then when you step on the second step, you get more joy. Try to carry the joy from each step upward to the forthcoming steps. Real joy is free of all sickness. So if you can climb up with the heart’s abundant joy, the altitude problem cannot be serious. Naturally, the discoveries of medical science you will carry with you. But you will also carry spiritual light in your heart.</p>
<p>Each time the altitude changes, with a new delight you can enter into that altitude. This is how a spiritual person can conquer altitude sickness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can Americans help the Russians most?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can Americans help the Russians most?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An American can do quite a few things to help a Russian. To start with, either consciously or unconsciously, an American will not belittle the Russian, he will not ignore the Russian, he will not suspect the Russian and he will develop conscious trust in the Russian. He will take the Russian as a true member of America’s universal oneness-family. If an American can do all this, then definitely he is helping the Russian most, both in the Russian’s inner life and in his outer life. While helping the Russian in his inner life and outer life, the American will also be amply rewarded, not only by the soul of Russia, but also by the soul of America. The soul of Russia will reward him with gratitude, and the soul of America will reward him with pride, divine pride.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is cleverness bad for spirituality?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is cleverness bad for spirituality?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know first of all what we mean by cleverness. Cleverness can be something very undivine, a cunning or roguish quality. Again, cleverness from a different angle can be wisdom. In ordinary human life, we may use cleverness either to deceive someone or in some way to be a winner, while a third party will be the loser. But if you look at it from a very high point of view, cleverness is wisdom. This wisdom is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. It is a higher weapon to conquer misunderstanding and many, many wrong forces. If you use your wisdom, then you see the good qualities of two parties — your own good qualities, let us say, and also the good qualities of the person with whom you are dealing. So by using wisdom, you save yourself and also the people who are concerned. In this way there can be harmony and peace.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, wisdom is always necessary. This wisdom you can say is cleverness from a higher spiritual point of view. It is not the cleverness that will deceive someone or the cleverness that will make you the winner and someone else the loser — no, no, no. This is the wisdom that will bring to the fore not only your own good qualities, but also the good qualities of others. Wisdom-light is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life so that you can avoid misunderstandings and unhappiness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we hurt your third eye?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we hurt your third eye?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The third eye, which is the vision-eye, is like the soul. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says the soul does not take birth, it does not die, weapons cannot pierce it, fire cannot burn it, wind cannot dry it, water cannot drench it and so on. That description can easily be applied to the third eye. But in my case, my third eye <em>can</em> be hurt in a different way — through sadness. If I see that my disciples are not doing the right thing, if I see that they are doing everything wrong, it hurts me badly. It hurts my central being. Definitely it hurts my third eye and also my Lord Beloved Supreme. So from a different point of view, my third eye can be hurt, but it is not as if somebody comes with a knife and strikes my third eye. No, it will not be hurt in that way. But by being identified with the wrong actions of my disciples and of humanity, definitely my third eye is being hurt every day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God’s supreme Secret is: “Do not give up!” He says to His children, “I have not given up on you. So, My children, you also should not give up.” Every day in secrecy supreme God is telling human beings, “Your life is still unfinished. Since I have not given up on you, you also should not give up.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely a soulful smile is part of meditation. If it is a genuinely soulful smile, it comes from the depth of our meditation. Otherwise, somebody can play a trick on us, pretending that they are offering us a soulful smile. If the soulful smile is genuine, and if you can smile a few times soulfully at your fellow travellers on life’s road, then definitely it is part of your meditation.</p>

 <p>
SCA 656-658. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in San Francisco on 15 March 1991.</p>
<h2>Question: Now that I have become your disciple, should I continue with some of my outer activities, such as flying and tennis?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are enjoying flying, then you should do it. When we are up in the sky, at that time we think, “How beautiful the ground is.” While we are on the ground, we think, “How beautiful the sky looks.” This is the human mind. When we are up, at that time we like the world that is below. When we are below, we like the world that is above. If you can feel both are beautiful, that is the best. While you are on the ground, do your duty as soulfully as possible. While you are in the air, do your duty there with equal devotion. Try not to make any comparison between the two.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, you have to try to be the best person, the best seeker. Whether you are in the air or on the ground, you are praying to the same God. The same God is in the plane and on the tennis court. At this moment you are in one room, at the next moment in another room. Do not make any comparison that this room is far better than the other room or that flying is more enjoyable than playing tennis. No, if you want to be a good tennis player, as you are, then pay attention to tennis, and while you are flying, pay attention to flying. At that time do not think of tennis strokes. If you think of topspin you will spin!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes I have my most powerful meditations when I am teaching meditation classes. I am wondering, do you intervene there?

I am wondering, do you intervene there? Are you always present in the classes?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have countless inner beings. My physical mind may not know that you are holding a class, but my inner beings do help people to serve the Supreme in me. In this case, it is not necessary for my outer mind to know what you are doing. But if something very serious is going to take place, something most important, then one of my inner beings will inform me immediately. Again, if you give these classes soulfully and devotedly, then you will get extra blessings. But if you give them mechanically, then my inner beings only observe. Something is better than nothing. You could have stayed at home and watched television instead of giving the class.</p>
<p>Again, you may not be in your highest consciousness, but you are inspiring someone else to be in their highest. In this way, you can also get the blessingful gratitude of my inner beings, by being the instrument to raise somebody else’s consciousness. If you were not there to offer the class, then perhaps those people would not have come to meditate. They would have spent their time in a restaurant or somewhere else. So my inner beings are always observing, guiding and helping all my disciples.</p>
<p>It is not only my disciples who are being helped. There are many, many people who are not my disciples and perhaps will never become disciples, but just because they are praying and meditating and doing the right thing for the same God, our Supreme, my inner beings help them considerably. Countless times my inner beings have helped people who are not my disciples and will never become my disciples but who are doing something good for mankind. But if you are my disciple, then I will take more responsibility, infinitely more responsibility for you, and you will also have more feeling of responsibility towards me. So we depend on each other. I depend on you to serve and manifest God, and you depend on me for your highest realisation. Like this, we shall grow together.</p>
<p>Again, there are many, many others whom I help every hour of every day. Outwardly they will not know, and outwardly I will not know, but inwardly I <em>do</em> know. Through my inner beings, in a fleeting second I know how many are getting help from me. Some are not going to be my disciples, but they are still God’s children. They are my brothers; they are my sisters. As long as they are praying to God to become better citizens of the world, it is more than enough for me. In a big family or a big club, you do not know everyone by name. If you are studying at a university, there are thousands of students. You do not know them by name, but if they do anything significant, immediately you claim that they belong to the same university as you do. This is our oneness. So here also, if somebody is really trying to do something for God, then my blessings, my gratitude are there for that person. They do not have to be my disciples.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the correct spiritual response to homeless people when they ask for money?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the correct spiritual response to homeless people when they ask for money?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just look at the person, and your heart will tell you what to do. Sometimes they pretend to be beggars so that you will give them money, and then immediately they go to a bar. God will bless you for your stupidity if you give them money. But if the person is really hungry and if you are in a position to help, then naturally you will help that person so he can go to a restaurant and eat.</p>
<p>Some people are not actually poor, but they have formed the habit of begging or borrowing. Your heart will immediately tell you if the person is sincere. Then you can do the needful. But if you help someone to go and drink, you are only adding ignorance to his life. If you give a subway token because someone wants to go to a church to pray and meditate, then you are doing the right thing with your money-power. But if you give your money-power to someone who is leading an undivine life, then your lack of wisdom is responsible for adding to his stupidity. Unconsciously if we touch fire, we will still burn our finger. Even if it is an innocent, little child, his innocence will not save him. The very nature of fire is to burn his finger. So we have to be wise. As we will not touch fire, in exactly the same way, we have to use our wisdom when we deal with human beings.</p>
