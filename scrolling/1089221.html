<h2>Childhood tale</h2>

<p>I didn't come of a poor family; I came of a rich family, but we gave all our material wealth to the ashram. My eldest brother went first to the ashram and then the younger ones went. My uncle was against it, but my brother said that all would stay. He said, "If they leave the ashram, then I will also leave. Right now they are young. It is my duty to do the right thing for them." Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, has taken our property. But in those days we had two or three large gardens and several houses. My father was the inspector of a large railway junction then.</p>
<p>When I was a child in Pondicherry, I had a dog named Bhaga. It means "tiger." We wanted our dog to be in the city with our relatives. Finally, we took him in a boat and he stayed with my maternal uncle.</p>
<p>Bhaga was very devoted. Several miles he used to cover to deliver a message. He went three and a half miles to my aunt's place and gave her a message. Then, from my aunt's place he was so eager to come back. Twice he did that.</p>
<p>Bhaga was big, spirited and very powerful. If you dropped something, if you made any sound, then you were finished; he used to bark for five minutes. When we were studying for our examinations, we never studied silently. To convince the physical mind that we were studying, we used to recite aloud. At that time, when anything went wrong, the dog used to bark. That was Bhaga.</p>
<p>I had a white hare. I had also many, many birds. I had a kite and others. Then we had a few monkeys. One monkey was named Madhu. I was very fond of monkeys. There was a chain hanging down from a pole and at the top was a small round house where they lived. The monkeys' lives were spent climbing up and down the chain and screaming. Then from their own bodies they removed bugs. Every second they used to discover some thing on their skin. We could not see anything, but a monkey sees everything on its own body.</p>
<p>The monkeys used to bite. When a monkey starts running toward you, you have to lie down and stop breathing. If you act as if you are dead, then it will never, never bite. So many times I did that when I was about six years old. Little children of one or two years and elderly people they never bite, but young boys and girls they bite. A few times I was caught. I have at least ten or twelve marks. I used to go near a monkey with such fondness and joy, but then I forgot that the chain was so long. Sometimes, before I brought food for the monkey, it used to bite me. We had a servant who was fourteen or fifteen years old. There was not a single day when he was not bitten by one particular monkey.</p>
<p>When monkeys are tame, they show affection. My mother was not bitten even once. They felt kindness in my mother. My sister once or twice was bitten. The monkey-bite hurts a lot. It bleeds immediately and profusely. How many times my right or left thigh or my elbow was bitten! Their teeth are very small but they grind. My brother Mantu never gave them any bananas or anything else to eat. He didn't like monkeys, he didn't like dogs, he didn't like cats. He was against every kind of animal. Monkeys do something that is really worth seeing. They climb up a tree and from the very topmost branch they jump into a pond. Then they swim across.</p>
<p>I have disciples whose children were once upon a time their pets. In a previous incarnation somebody had a pet dog, and now the pet dog has become a member of the family. Suppose you had a dog; now that dog has become your brother. In your family it has taken its first human incarnation, Like that, we also had maidservants who wanted to come into our family. They pleased us so much and their wish was to come into our family. Just open your third eye and see whether I am telling you the truth!</p>

 <p>
JH 2-15. During an informal gathering on December 1977, Sri Chinmoy invited his disciples to ask him "mundane questions, funny questions or illumining questions." The disciples meditated for a minute, and then began asking him questions. These are the questions and his answers.</p>
<h2>Question: Is there spiritual significance to body-building?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Body-building is like house-building. If the house is strong, then you can live inside the house for a long time. Of course, quite unexpectedly if a cyclone or an earthquake takes place, then the house will be demolished. But otherwise, if the house is very strong, then it lasts for a long time. Similarly, if the physical is strong, then it is easier for the soul to manifest its divinity. Of course, the soul's influence operating in and through the body has to be felt. So body-building I do appreciate and admire. It is a real necessity for the seeker to keep a very strong and powerful body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Was the Vishma of the Mahabharata a bad person for fighting against Sri Krishna?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Was the Vishma of the Mahabharata a bad person for fighting against Sri Krishna?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Vishma of the Mahabharata was the greatest hero in those days, plus the grandsire of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. To please his father he remained unmarried. To please his stepmother he did not accept the throne. So in every case he was extremely great. Also, he was extremely close to Lord Krishna. Only four or five human beings knew extremely well in the inner world who Krishna was, and Vishma was one of those. Inwardly, he worshipped Krishna most powerfully.</p>
<p>Vishma felt miserable that the Pandavas suffered so much in spite of the fact that Krishna was on their side. He taught the Pandavas secretly how they could kill him. Now look at this! If you fight against someone, will you tell that person how to kill you? This was Vishma. His heart was all the time with the Pandavas, but he was morality-bound to the Kauravas. In India they say that if you take salt from someone, then you have to be grateful to that person and take his side. The Kauravas assisted him in his own life; they met with his expenses and did many things for him. That is why he took their side, but his heart was all the time for the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Here the philosophy is complicated. Real spirituality will be always for God, for the Supreme. No matter how much you have got from this world, no matter how much help you have received from an individual or from a group of people, when the Hour strikes, you have always to take God's side. It was God who all the time was helping you in and through these individuals at a particular stage in your life. If God changes His Will and wants you to serve Him in a different way, then you have to do it. So Vishma should have taken the Pandavas side when he saw that Krishna was on their side.</p>
<p>Vishma was so great; he kept all his promises. He even told his so-called enemies how to kill him. But at the last moment he did not take God's side. That was his only short-coming. Otherwise, his compassion, his love for truth, his promise-keeping will always remain unparalleled in the history of the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In their next incarnation I hope that the seven hundred or eight hundred divine or undivine soldiers that I have will practise spirituality. I will not take incarnation, but they will have a soul's connection with me. Their connection with me will be infinitely stronger because of my God-realisation. A soul's connection with Vishma or any other human being will not be as strong, because that person has not realised God. Vishma knew who Krishna was. In your highest consciousness you people also are aware of who I am. But that does not mean that you have realised me. You know that I am a spiritual Master of great height and all that, but to know me and to realise me are totally different things.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Who made me a space cadet? Did God make me a space cadet or did I make myself a space cadet?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Who made me a space cadet? Did God make me a space cadet or did I make myself a space cadet?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am diving deep within to answer this question. God made you thirty-three per cent a space cadet. Then you liked it so much that you took advantage of what God had given you and you added sixty-six per cent. And I liked it so much that I added the extra one per cent.</p>
<p>So God started the game, you continued the game and I completed it. Thirty-three per cent of the credit goes to God, sixty-six per cent goes to your own noble self and one per cent goes to me. So in this way you are a perfect space cadet - a divinely perfect, supremely perfect, one hundred per cent space cadet.</p>
<p>Yesterday you proved it. You got into the car without your books. So, does my mind work, or does only my soul work? When you were inside the car your Master said, "She has come without her books." So the first thing I asked you when you got inside the car was, "Where are your books?" Then you ran. If we had left, the custodian would have gone home and God alone knows where the books might have gone.</p>
<p>To be a space cadet is the greatest honour. Many times I have taught the space cadets various things. When you eat, do you take the dishes out of your house? Do you walk in the street with only one shoe on? Do you forget your name? No, you don't forget your name. There was a time when I did those things, so still I can defeat you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Paper means knowledge. It represents the wisdom of the human brain. The discoveries of human beings are written down on paper. If we kick or touch our discoveries with our feet, then we are not honouring our achievements and discoveries. If we look down on our own achievements and if we don't value our own discoveries, then how are we going to value anything? There is something higher and deeper inside the paper, and that is the supreme discovery of our human brain. This discovery is nothing other than light. Therefore, we should not touch paper with the feet. It is a crime.</p>
<p>There is a special deity who embodies knowledge and wisdom. Her name is Saraswati. She represents wisdom or knowledge in boundless measure and according to our receptivity we receive from her. But we need a vehicle to contain what we receive, and the vehicle is a book. So books contain the inspiration from the goddess Saraswati. Whenever we see a thing, we have to go to its source. The source of the book is the living goddess Saraswati. How can we touch the goddess in that piece of paper with our feet? How can we kick her? Impossible! So we should not touch paper with our feet because inside it is the living presence of the cosmic goddess.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes the boys fool around in physical ways like in wrestling. Is that okay to do at certain times or is it not good to do at all?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes the boys fool around in physical ways like in wrestling. Is that okay to do at certain times or is it not good to do at all?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (jokingly):</em> Boys should be boys; girls should be girls. Boys should show their muscle-power and vital power, and girls should show their gossip-capacity .... I didn't say that.</p>
<p>A little bit is good. But there is a great difference between exuberance and violence. Again, sometimes innocent exuberance can lead to destructive violence. Many times it starts in a joking manner. Then somebody's ego is hurt and it becomes a serious fight. It starts with innocence, but that innocence does not remain. If you can maintain the innocent fun throughout, then it is very good. Then all the undivine vital qualities go out of the body.</p>
<p>No one is better than Ashrita in this respect. Ashrita is the best. When Ashrita divine goes into our kitchen and sees Casey, if he tears off Casey's T-shirt, then what are you going to do? Someone will give Casey the money to buy another shirt, so there is no harm. But in the name of exercise, to test his strength, if he presses Casey's thumb and breaks it, that is very bad. The shirt can easily be replaced but if the thumb is damaged, then how can you replace it?</p>
<p>So fun I appreciate, but it has to remain altogether innocent and harmless. If it becomes violent and ends in physical injuries, then it has to be totally stopped. Showing off vital capacities or exuberant capacities is necessary; otherwise, you will have a life of gloom, frustration and depression that is infinitely, infinitely worse than the outer vital excitement.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Good boy, always think of the ideal. The ideal means the height; the ideal means the source. Always think of me as your highest height and your source in any field. Suppose you need inspiration in writing poems. Immediately think of my poetry-capacity; think of the thousands of poems I have written. If you need inspiration in painting, then think of my art-capacity. Here your ideal is the poet in me or the artist in me. If you need the inspiration to realise God, then think of the seeker in me. In any field where you need inspiration, immediately see me as the highest height to which you are aspiring. If you think of the highest height, then automatically you get inspiration.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Oh, there is a yawning gulf between the highest height and my present state." But my theory is always to think of the highest and the largest. You may see yourself as only a tiny drop, but if you think of the ocean, then immediately you will see that the ocean can never be separated from the tiny drop. The highest height can never be separated from the lowest, because there is no break between the lowest and the highest. If you think of yourself as the foot of the tree and me as the height, then easily you can see that we are one. If something goes wrong with the foot, the foundation, then the tree breaks and its height goes away. So if you think of yourself and of me in this way, then you will know that if something goes wrong with you, then my height also goes.</p>
<p>From inspiration you get aspiration; from aspiration you get realisation. When I am looking at you, immediately think of me as realisation. Realisation means a flood of light. Right now just a little light you have, but you want to go to the infinite effulgence of light.</p>
<p>If you see the ultimate, then immediately you get a kind of inner joy and inner thrill, and this will inspire you. But if you think of yourself as starting to run a marathon race, with the goal far beyond, then you are lost. With your aspiration you are just starting, and you have to go one mile, two miles, three miles, four miles; O God! If you think this way, then you are finished; you will never reach your realisation-goal. No, you have to think of your first goal as one mile, your second goal as two miles, your third goal as three miles and so on. When you start the marathon, take the first mile as your goal, and at that time think that I am also there. Or if even that seems too far away, then feel that I am at the start with you. In this way you will be able to complete the distance between your aspiration and your realisation. Again, you may say, "If Guru is here at the start with me, then what is the use of going there? If I get him here at the start, then I don't have to see him at the finish." That is not good, either. The best thing is to feel my inspiration and aspiration inside you. But don't forget that I am there in the goal, with the goal and as the goal for you.</p>
<p>So always when you want to do something or become something, think of the highest height. Think of me or meditate on me; or if you can't think and you can't meditate, then just imagine. For thinking you have to use the mind, but if you want to grow into something, then you have to use the aspiring heart. Thinking is a very difficult subject. It may take such a long time to think of someone as a good person. You are trying desperately to think of some good qualities in Nathan, but it is taking such a long time for you. He has caused the fire in your store, so it is very difficult for you to think of his good qualities. But easily you can imagine, "Oh, Nathan is such a good boy." Imagination far surpasses thinking-power. So if you can imagine what your goal is, then you get immediate inspiration. Use your imagination-power and then you will see that your inspiration-power and aspiration-power have become very powerful and strong.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Are you sure that the baby was getting that kind of high experience — that the world is full of sorrow? Maybe he had just been scolded by his mother for misbehaving or something?</p>
<p><em>My feeling was that this was an expression of not understanding the world.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I don't think the baby's soul was so developed that it was identifying with the world-soul. Only I think it was your own feeling projected, for what you described is not coming to me inwardly. It was your own aspiration and your own state of consciousness that you thought of; it was not coming from the baby at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You wanted to help the suffering of the world. You saw that the baby was helpless, so the baby became a symbol of helplessness. This is a very high experience, but I don't think the baby was experiencing it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you meditate you become very, very still. Even if you are standing up, your physical doesn&#039;t move at all. You can become like a statue if you want. How can you do that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you meditate you become very, very still. Even if you are standing up, your physical doesn&#039;t move at all. You can become like a statue if you want. How can you do that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The rest of the time I shout and bark and become restlessness-prince, but at that time you want to know how I become poise incarnate. The physical has to be a perfect instrument for manifesting the inner wealth that comes from beyond the physical. Take the eyes, for example. When I offer light, I offer it through my physical eyes. When I am doing something very high and sublime, it is the stillness of the physical that can hold the sublimity, profundity, equanimity, divinity or supreme reality that I am bringing down. What I am bringing down is being expressed in the physical. It is not stiffness; it is poise. My inner poise in my physical is like a solid, adamantine wall; it is the inner poise that keeps the physical extremely solid and hard. At that time my physical has become a perfect channel to manifest the inner tranquillity on earth. Anything that we have has to be manifested through the physical for the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Although the physical is standing still, it is running the fastest. My body, my physical, has become one with my inner self. Outwardly you can see the stillness, but inside the stillness itself is my inner vision, my inner range. To your physical eyes it will appear like stillness, but if you had realised God, then you would see that the stillness is not a static stillness at all. The physical perception is stillness, but the inner perception sees that along with the stillness is the fastest movement of my inner being, which is covering the length and breadth of the world with its inner range and inner vision.</p>
<p>So if you use the physical eye, then it is stillness; and if you use the inner eye, then you see that the inner being is moving faster than the fastest. If you can use both the inner eye and the outer eye, then you will see that my being is at once still and dynamic. It is dynamic and static at the same time. The static aspect you see and the dynamic aspect you do not see with your physical eyes; but they are absolutely interdependent.</p>
<p><em>I saw it as dynamic, Guru, but I don't think anybody else in the world could do what you do.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are in the highest height and we descend. In Sri Ramakrishna's case, his disciples used to offer him something to smoke so that he could come down and become part and parcel of the physical consciousness, the earth-consciousness. In my case, I do something else to come down to the level of my children. I have gone up and, when I descend, the foot represents solid earth, the material, earthly world. From my highest if I want to become one with the earth-consciousness, then the foot is the solid foundation.</p>
<p>Again, the feet of the Master represent boundless compassion. This compassion you can pull, as though you were a magnet. I have given permission to very few disciples — I can count them on my fingertips — to touch my feet with their hands or head. The strongest magnetic pull of my feet takes away the problems of this incarnation, even of the past incarnations. When I want to bless someone by bringing down compassion, I can use my hands or my eyes. But the feet always keep infinite compassion for this world — for the disciples and for the seekers. Again, why do I not do it for everybody? Because everybody does not deserve it: everybody does not want it. They say, "Oh, we need compassion," but they are afraid that compassion is nothing but transformation. They say, "We want transformation," but as soon as they see the enormity of the result, they are frightened to death. We say that we want to be as bright as the sun, but when we see the effulgence of the sun, we are frightened to death. We ask God to make us as powerful and strong as an elephant. Then, when we see an elephant, we are frightened to death. We ask God to make us as strong as a lion, but when we stand in front of a roaring lion, we are frightened to death. Here also the seekers want something, but when they face the reality they are frightened to death by the reality. That is why I don't allow more people to touch my feet. My feet embody boundless, immediate compassion. This reality they don't want; it frightens them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The smoke from the fire got into everything in my store and it made everything smell. My question is, did it also get into the soul of the store?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The smoke from the fire got into everything in my store and it made everything smell. My question is, did it also get into the soul of the store?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The earthly smell cannot permeate the soul. The soul cannot be touched or attacked by the smell unless it wants to be. If the soul wants to see how bad the smell is by becoming part and parcel of the smell, then the soul can do so. It is like having a garbage can. If you have a garbage can, what do you do? You dispose of the garbage because you don't want to keep the foul smell inside. But again, if you want to be inside the garbage can, who prevents you? Nobody! The soul also tries to get rid of this smell as soon as possible. If you keep the garbage for a long time and either unconsciously or deliberately enjoy the smell, then naturally you will have something of the smell inside you. It depends on how long you keep it.</p>
<p>In the case of the soul, if the smell remains for a few days, it is nothing. The soul has the capacity to remain undisturbed and unperturbed. But if you do not clean the place for months, then the soul's compassion will take the smell not as a smell, not as an abstract thing, but as a being. The soul takes it as a solid, concrete being that is helpless. Then the soul shows its compassion and tries to identify itself with the smell. At that time the soul will embody the smell and it will take some time before the hour comes when you can get rid of it. But here I clearly see that the soul will not be affected, because it will be a matter of only a few days before the smell is gone.</p>
<p>If a soul is very undeveloped or unripe, or very restless, we say that the soul is destructive. How can a soul be destructive? It can be destructive by becoming one with its stupid mentor, the unaspiring vital, and by mixing with the vital. Then we say that the soul is destructive. The soul itself is not destructive, but it is mixing with the vital to such an extent that it has been eclipsed by the vital. Sometimes the soul mixes with the vital in the hope that it will be able to change the vital in its destructive aspect; it is using its will-power to try to transform the vital power. It enters from the subtle vital into the gross vital with the hope that very soon it will create aspiration in the destructive vital. So the soul, out of infinite compassion, becomes one with the destructive vital in order to transform it. But if the soul is not strong, then it can be temporarily eclipsed by the destructive vital. At that time we say that it is a destructive soul. First you try from a distance to transform the darkness, using a flashlight. But if you see that it is not working, then you go there with your soul's light, with your aspiration and your dedication, and you try to transform it.</p>
