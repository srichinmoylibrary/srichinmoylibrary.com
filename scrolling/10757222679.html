<p><em>(At Cambridge. The Principle had sent for Aurobindo. Aurobindo was very bashful; it was not in his nature to come to the fore.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Good morning, Sir.</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL: Ah, at last you have come. Better late than never. I have sent for you three times.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Sorry, Sir, please excuse me. I was a bit busy then.</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL: My dear boy, nothing wrong with you, I suppose? Now, I come to the point: your essay on Milton. I have never seen such a wonderful piece by an undergrad since I came over here. You have headed the list</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(Bashfully smiling)</em> Thank you, Sir, it is so kind of you. If there was any inspiration, it must have been from the great subject of the essay himself.</p>

<p><em>(Indian Majlis. Aurobindo and a dozen Indian students.)</em></p>
<p>AUROBINDO: The British must no longer lord it over India. Come, let us mobilise ourselves to uproot their rule from the soil of our Motherland.</p>
<p>1ST MEMBER: I have crossed seven seas and thirteen rivers just to appear in the I.C.S. If I listen to you I shall soon run into difficulties with the authorities, and, worse still, my life may be ruined.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I, too, shall sit for the I.C.S. But I shan't serve the British Government.</p>
<p>2ND MEMBER: To be sure, the freedom of India can never be won by us, for we are unimaginably weak. And if it is not true, show us the way.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: At the very outset we must make the people of India feel the unavoidable necessity of being a free country.</p>
<p>3RD MEMBER: You mean revolution? Be sure, I affiliate myself with no such thing! You may call me a poltroon, if you like. I am not at all prepared to risk my precious life. <em>(Places his hands on his chest.)</em></p>
<p>4TH MEMBER: I am absolutely at one with you. Who does not know the supreme truth that Non-violence is the greatest of all virtues? Circumstances will lead our dear Mother India to freedom if so is the Will of God. We are not to sacrifice our valuable lives, and again we are not to commit the ghastly sin of putting an end to English lives.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: <em>(After heaving a sigh)</em> Mine is a road absolutely different from yours. God guides my life to another goal.</p>
<p>5TH MEMBER: Where do you get so much inspiration from?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I do not really know. Just last night I had a terrible dream. I saw a demon drinking the blood from the very breast of an old woman. We all went in hot haste to her rescue. To our joy we saved her life. But some of us were removed to the other world by that demon. I was just pondering who that woman was. Soon I heard a voice, so vivid, so pathetic! "I am your Bharatmata." And there ends my dream. From to-day the sole aim of my life is to make India as free as a bird in the sky.</p>
<p>6TH MEMBER: There is a secret society here at Cambridge named "Lotus and Dagger." Would you like to be a member of it?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Certainly, most gladly. With all my heart I shall serve the society.</p>
<p>6TH MEMBER: Then one day I'll take you there.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Thanks in advance, dear friend. Let that day come soon!</p>

<p><em>(Aurobindo is asleep. It is far into the night. It is the eve of his departure. Enter Bharatmata. Hair dishevelled, face overwhelmed with sorrow, old sari with many holes.)</em></p>
<p>BHARATMATA: My son, I am come at last. India demands your express arrival. For you will awake the slumbering nation. Darkness has begun to thicken in front of me. It will serve no use to lengthen my story by fruitless emotional gestures. Make me free, make me free, my son.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Mother, I offer my heart and soul to abide by your high command. No more shall you utter the wail of misery. I shall turn the wind of/Swadesh/ into a gigantic tornado.</p>
<p>BHARATMATA: I am so happy, I am so happy, my son, for your face shows a thunder-willed determination.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the presiding deity of Britain)</em></p>
<p>DEITY: My son, I have brought you up for the last fourteen years with kindly love and affection. Have I no claim?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Certainly, you do have. But our India must have freedom to save all humanity from peril. In the years to come, India and Britain will cherish a unique amity. No futile wrangling — the flood of peace shall inundate both countries.</p>
<p>DEITY: My sole request to you is that you will not do away with my language and literature. Nothing more, nothing less I ask of you.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: To you I am immensely indebted. My pen shall ever serve your language and thus I shall as well serve you.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the World-Mother on tip-toe. She looks intently into his face.)</em></p>
<p>MOTHER: Do you recognise me?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: I have seen you time and again in the world of dream. But shall we ever meet in the physical world?</p>
<p>MOTHER: Why not, why not? At the divine hour I shall go and stand beside you in India. Down to earth we shall carry our highest Truth. You and I shall be the harbingers of a new humanity. I know, but you do not yet know that you are the new Sri Krishna of India. You are my Lord.</p>

<p><em>(Khulna. A religious mendicant sings while passing by the residence of Dr. K.D. Ghosh.)</em></p>
<p>MENDICANT:</p>

<p>Mother, Mother, Mother Kali!<br /> Knowledge of earth is strange to me.<br /> I know not how to sing of Thee.<br /> My feeble mind is a fruitless tree.<br /> Thine Eyes are fire, Thy Heart is love.<br /> My bosom pines to be thy dove.</p>

<p>K.D.: Ah, what moving and melting music! Mother Kali to my rescue! Who else can cool my racking pain? Worried thoughts about my son Auro are eating into my heart.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a messenger with a telegram)</em></p>
<p>MESSENGER: Sir, a wire for you.</p>
<p>K.D.: At last! Maybe it's from Auro. <em>(On opening the message he falls to the ground. His soul turns the keen vibration of its pain to an inner music. )</em></p>

<p>My Auro! Auro! all world-pain in flood<br /> Within my finite breast.<br /> My pride, my country's pride, O earth's hope-noon,<br /> The all-transforming Crest!</p>
<p>Alas! to feed my longings high, no more<br /> Shall I see my Auro, my son.<br /> The sombre night envelops my mortal sheath<br /> To-day my heart is undone.</p>
<p>Now cruel fate has torn my vision's Rose.<br /> Auro, I shut my eyes<br /> To see your golden face, to be with you<br /> In the blue-white climbing skies. [fn:3]</p>

<p><em>(K.D. Ghosh had almost intuitive high hopes that his Auro was to brighten the face of the mother country. The ship which was to carry Auro sank on the way. But Auro boarded a second ship. On the assumption that his son must have perished with the lost ship his father died of a broken heart.)</em></p>

<p>I set in front Fire, the messenger, and speak to the carrier of the offerings; may he bring to their session here the gods.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Auro and his maternal uncle Jogendra)</em></p>
<p>JOGENDRA: Father, look, here is Auro.</p>
<p><em>(The Rishi springs to his feet and hugs Auro warmly to his breast before the grandson can bend his head down. The Rishi knew well that his Auro was no ordinary human being but Sri Krishna in human form. A deep silence seems to vibrate with their hearts' exchanges.)</em></p>
<p>THE RISHI: Jogen, call Swarna quick. Where is she? Swarna, Swarna! <em>(Half-choked in joy he calls out to his daughter on the top of his voice.)</em> Auro, my child, do you find your country, your Motherland, familiar?</p>
<p>AURO: Dadu, I'm afraid I can recall nothing that I had seen and heard before I left India. Things now appear to be refreshing, inspiring, enlightening. As I stepped on India's soil, at Apollo Bunder, Bombay, I felt drowned as if in a sea of peace.</p>
<p>THE RISHI: Oh, it's significant, deeply significant. It is a signal. Mother India wants you to be her own, for her work, for her soul's work. It was her soul's embrace to her chosen child.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Swarnalata with two of her women friends)</em></p>
<p>SWARNA: <em>(After scanning Auro's face for a few seconds)</em> No, Father, not at all. This youth doesn't take after my child Auro. In England I left him quite young on earth. How could he grow such a big moustache! My son can never grow so big. No, you can never by my son. He had more grace in his face. Impossible, impossible. Father, I'm not such a fool as you take me to be. Oh, now, now!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Swarnalata in utter delusion)</em></p>
<p><em>(A chorus of laughter by Jogendra and the two women. Silent, amazed, Auro looks on.)</em></p>
<p>THE RISHI: Auro, your mother is off her head and so am I. Like father like daughter.</p>
<p>AURO: If my mother is queer in her brain then I, too ... There's no other possibility.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Swarnalata)</em></p>
<p>SWARNA: I remember well that my Auro had a cut on one of his fingers. Let me see if you have the mark.</p>
<p>AURO: <em>(Shooting a glance half-afraid at his mother's face and showing his finger)</em> Here it is, mother, here's the mark.</p>
<p>SWARNA: My Auro, my Auro! You are my son Auro. Father, he is my son Auro. Truly, he is the Krishna of my dream. <em>(Overwhelmed with joy she places her right palm on her son's devoted head.)</em> Now I am more than right that you are my son Auro.</p>
<p>AURO: Dadu, goodness gracious! At last my mother has to say, - Eureka, Eureka! -</p>

<p>KESHTA: Babu, Babu.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: to-morrow a very, very great man comes from Bengal. So your cooking must be especially fine.</p>
<p>KESHTA: Easily done, Sir. But one thing. Spices and ghee have run short.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: <em>(Handing the servant a five-rupee note)</em> Buy spices and ghee from the market, and don't forget to get potatoes, cauliflowers and green mangoes.</p>

<p>AUROBlNDD: <em>(Pointing to a wall-map of India)</em> Look at that map. Learn to find in it the portrait of Bharatmata. The cities, mountains, rivers and forests are the materials which go to make up Her body. The people inhabiting the country are the cells which go to make up Her living tissues. Our literature is Her memory and speech. The spirit of Her culture is Her soul. The happiness and freedom of Her children is Her salvation. Behold Bharat as a living Mother, meditate upon Her and worship Her in the nine-fold way of <em>bhakti</em>.</p>
<p>MUNSHI: Sir, how can I meditate upon the Mother?</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Just go through the works of Swami Vivekananda, and you will be able to meditate upon the Mother.</p>

<p>AUROBINDO: No, no. These are special dishes for you.</p>
<p>DINENDRA: Good Heavens! special dishes, indeed! <em>(Looks daggers at Keshta.)</em> Keshta, how incorrigible you are! You have spoiled everything. Your very sight is repugnant to me. Barmecide covers were better far than your concoction. What a burning sensation from mouth to gullet!</p>

<p>CHARU: Chief, to our great good luck we have you with us to-day. This time I have something to confide to you. I have read your <em>Bhavani Mandir</em>. It has moved me to my depths. I have decided to give myself to the service of your great Ideal.</p>
<p>AURO: Very glad, godspeed.</p>
<p>SUBODH: We intend to open a National College in Bengal with you as the Head.</p>
<p>AURO: Believe me, I must go to Bengal if you sincerely want me there.</p>
<p>SUBODH: We hesitate to offer you a remuneration far beneath your notice. Still, poor Bengal would have a princely youth like you for the post.</p>

<p><em>(A trip to Kashmir. The Maharaja of Baroda and Aurobindo on Shankaracharya Hill.)</em></p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Arvind Babu, now we are on the top of the hill. We have ascended a thousand feet above the level of the valley of Kashmir. As we climbed higher and higher I felt as if a screen were slowly lifting up and revealing the splendid beauty of Kashmir. It seems you, too, are thrilled all over by the scenery of this place.</p>
<p>AURO: My feeling is at once overwhelming and inexpressible.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: What is it? I must hear it from you, I must <em>(He comes closer to Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>AURO: I made no effort, yet I have had an experience of something so vivid, so astonishing.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Do confide it to me, my young friend!</p>
<p>AURO: It is the vacant Infinite! It cannot be described in words. I am sure this experience will leave an abiding impression upon my mind.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: How wonderful you are! You have spiritual experiences while I merely enjoy the beauty of the scenery. By the bye, do you know the funny story about the Hill?</p>
<p>AURO: No. I would like to hear it from you.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: The story is that during his itinerant life the great Vedantin, Shankaracharya, with some of his disciples paid a visit to Kashmir. For some time they made their stay on this hill, and it was at his instance that this temple of Shiva was first set up. Hence this hill has been known as Shankaracharya Hill.</p>
<p>AURO: Now what about the funny portion?</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Ah, have patience, I am coming to the point. I have told you that Shankara came over here with his disciples. Soon they ran short of provisions. But from the neighbouring villages nobody turned up to offer hospitality to them. It was after some days that a few pundits came to meet them. The disciples of Shankara flew into a rage. They said to the pundits: "Are you not ashamed of your indifference? Are you so ignorant of the Shastric injunctions on hospitality to guests? Did you care to know that we have been without food for some days?" The pundits did not hesitate to defend themselves and asked: "How on earth could you expect us to know this?" Then they turned to Shankara and said that if he had any spiritual power he could have easily fed his disciples. Thereupon Shankara said: "I don't believe in Shakti. The world is an Illusion." The pundits cried out: "No, never, the world is real. It is Reality itself. The world is neither illusion nor hallucination."</p>
<p>AURO: The pundits are right, absolutely right.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: Ah, but let me complete the story. I have come to the end. The miracle begins. One of the pundits invoked a Goddess by chanting some mantras and placed his right palm on the ground. Lo, jets of water began springing up from below the very spot. Poor Shankara had to admit the existence of Shakti.</p>
<p>AURO: I fully believe in the power of such mantras.</p>
<p>MAHARAJA: So do I.</p>

<p><em>(Calcutta. Grey Street House. Mrinalini Devi reads out o letter which she has just received from Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>"Dearest Mrinalini,</p>
<p>... You have, perhaps, by now discovered that the one with whose fate yours is linked is a very strange kind of person. Mine is not the mental outlook, the aim of life and the domain of action which the generality of people in this country have at present. It is quite different in all respects, it is uncommon. Perhaps, you know by what name the generality of people call extraordinary ideas, uncommon actions, unusually high aspirations. They label all these things as madness, but if the mad man succeeds in the field of action then instead of calling him a lunatic they call him a great man, a man of genius."</p>
<p>MRINALINI: <em>(Saying to herself)</em> I fully agree with you, my Lord. I am sure your efforts will be crowned with success.</p>
<p><em>(She continues reading.)</em></p>
<p>"... it is my firm faith that whatever virtue, talent, higher education and knowledge and wealth which God has given me belongs to Him."</p>
<p>MRINALINI: O Merciful God, Thy Grace knows no bounds. I bow to Thee with all my heart and soul for giving me a husband who has no equal on earth.</p>
<p><em>(She continues reading.)</em></p>
<p>"... I know I have the strength to uplift this fallen race; it is not physical strength, I am not going to fight with the sword or with the gun, but with the power of knowledge. The power of the warrior is not the only kind of force, there is also the power of the Brahman which is founded on knowledge. This is not a new feeling within me, it is not of a recent origin, I was born with it, it is in my marrow, God sent me to the earth to accomplish this great mission."</p>
<p><em>(She is thrilled with joy and jumps up.</em></p>
<p>MRINALINI: I know, I know, you are not an ordinary human being. You are a Godlike man. Your great mission must succeed.</p>
<p><em>(She goes on.)</em></p>
<p>"... You should always offer to Him this prayer: - May I not come in the way of my husband's life and his ideals and his path to God-realisation; may I become his helper and his instrument. - Will you do it?"</p>
<p>MRINALINI: My Lord, I fail to believe my eyes. How could you imagine that I might come in the way of your life and your ideals and your path to God-realisation? I have no existence without you. I am entirely yours, within and without.</p>
