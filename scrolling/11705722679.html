  <h2 id="page-title">Dr. Davis: This is very interesting. The path to spirituality is a very complex one.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dr. Davis: This is very interesting. The path to spirituality is a very complex one." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The path to spirituality is not complex. Only there are different roads. If you want to go to Rome from some place in Europe, you can go by car, you can go by boat, you can go by airplane. If you go by plane, it is faster than the fastest. But if you take a boat, God knows how many days it will take. And if you are stupid enough to just start walking, then the road will never end!</p>
<p>In the spiritual life there are two main roads to take us to our destination. One road is longer than the longest; it is zig-zag and serpentine. That is the road of the mind. The other road is the road of the heart. This road is shorter than the shortest. You can say it is a sunlit road.</p>
<p>If you choose the mind-road, you will be constantly haunted by self-doubt: "Am I doing the right thing?" Or you will bring into your system the doubts of others. You will ask yourself, "What are they thinking? Are they saying that I am on the right course?" But if you follow the heart, it is not like that at all. Here there is a magnetic pull between God and you. He is your dearest Father and you are His dearest child, so both of you are using your own special magnets to pull one another closer."</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> So I am on the right track! It is good that I came to see you. I needed this confirmation. It is truly amazing. It is incredible. I started meditating on the heart because I feel that to protect myself, I must keep my heart pure. I like to radiate peace, love and joy, and I like my face to give off a smile and brilliance. In order for my face to show that, I must feel it inside. I am trying to keep my heart as an open vessel. There's a trait of youthfulness in me. I try to feel youthful, alive and energetic inside, and I hope it radiates.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day if you think of yourself as a child of four or five years old, then a childlike simplicity, sincerity and purity will abound in your life.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> That is how I think of myself. What you are saying to me is very timely.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your childlike qualities will always inspire others. The very presence of a child gives inspiration. When a child comes into a room, he brings spontaneous joy. And his joy is contagious; it enters into the elderly people who may be quarrelling and fighting there.</p>
<p>Each child is a new dream of God, bringing love, sheer love. When God's Dream enters into these elderly people who are quarrelling and fighting, they have to be silent. When a child is running here and there, he does not look at my face or your face to see how beautiful you are or how ugly I am. He just runs and shares his spontaneous joy with everybody. Your very presence radiates that kind of love. You do not have to look at somebody; you just have to be there and the love spreads.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are free this Wednesday evening, we will have a special meditation at P.S. 86. About 400 people come to meditate with me. Collectively we try to raise the consciousness of mankind on the strength of our silent meditation.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> I will try very, very hard to come on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you would like to meditate for three or four minutes personally with me on the stage, I would like to offer you my special way of meditation.</p>
<p>It is better not to eat for two hours before the meditation. You can drink a cup of tea or liquid substance, but if you take solid food, the heaviness you feel will create lethargy. We have to be dynamic when we meditate. Peace is nothing but inner dynamism. When we are at peace, twenty things we can accomplish in one second in the inner world. If we are not at peace, we are not able to accomplish even one thing in twenty hours.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Clothing has tremendous significance. When a policeman wears his uniform, the consciousness of the uniform enters into him and he is able to do his job more effectively. If somebody wears a military uniform, then he gets a military spirit. When a basketball champion wears his uniform, immediately the basketball consciousness enters into him. Otherwise, he may be thinking of his family, his wife, this and that. But as soon as he puts on his uniform, he thinks of how to score and other things. When these girls put on saris, immediately they feel serenity. They feel that something within them is inspiring them to lead a spiritual life, a life of peace. If they wear Western garments, they may not be inspired in this way. So no matter what we are doing, if we have a uniform it will help us get into the consciousness of that thing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Dr. Davis: It appears to me that when you start on the spiritual path, that is when the evil things come at you at a more intense pace.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Dr. Davis: It appears to me that when you start on the spiritual path, that is when the evil things come at you at a more intense pace." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we enter into the spiritual life, sometimes it happens that the hostile forces attack us more vehemently. We enter into the spiritual life to become one with God's Will. Then the forces attack us and say, "We will not allow you." God tells us, "You now want to become consciously one with Me. Then prove that you need My Love only." So we pray and meditate and God inundates us with His Compassion and His Grace to fight against these hostile forces.</p>
<p>The last time when you told us that you could not come to the meeting that we had scheduled, I had such a feeling for your soul. I saw in the inner world that your soul wanted to come. I said, "How is it that the mind is not listening to the heart and soul?"</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> You reached out at the time when I really needed to come. But it was like an avalanche of crises that I had to deal with. So today when my assistant came in and said, "Sri Chinmoy is inviting you, but I know you cannot go," I said, "No, I will be there." When he mentioned your name, I said that I would cancel everything.</p>
<p>When I started practising meditation, I used to go to religious book stores and pick up the books you had written. I knew your name when I was in Georgia and Minnesota. Without knowing you, I was reading your books. When I learnt that you live in New York, I was just amazed. I said, "Sri Chinmoy is in Jamaica, New York! I do not believe this!" I was thinking one would have to go to the Himalayas to see you.</p>
<p>This meeting tonight is spiritual food for me. Whenever we begin trying to do something with the spirit, we let the mind take over and we say, "Am I doing the right thing? Should I give up and go on?" A meeting like this says, "You are doing the right thing." Now I have confirmation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each thing has a spiritual significance. Incense gives us purity, and the flame of the candle represents our intense inner cry. Like the flame of the candle, our aspiration or inner cry is going up high, higher, highest. Our inner flame is going up to reach the all-illumining inner sun and then it is entering into the sun and becoming one with it. So definitely you should use a candle when you meditate. When you look at the flame, feel that it is burning in the heart, not in the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Use any colour that you like. Again, in each soul one particular colour is predominant. In your case, sky blue will give you much more joy than another colour. My favourite colour is also blue. The significance of that colour is Infinity. Blue represents the most beautiful, spiritual vastness. Although your main colour is blue, you can wear any colour. Similarly, you can select any flower to place on your shrine. You may like a rose whereas I may prefer a lotus.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My most favourite flower is the lotus.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> I chose the lotus as a symbol of my life because I want to stay grounded in water with the fluid motion around me. It goes deep. I tell people that I chose it as a symbol of my life because I want to be grounded in my family and God.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Water means consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Davis:</em> When I meditate in the morning, I go to the water.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy [offering some books]:</em> For me there is only one religion: love of God. You can be Christian, I can be Hindu, but our love of God is the only religion.</p>

SCA 135-147. On 24 April 1993, Sri Chinmoy met with Russell Wilson, who was then Staff Director of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. This informal conversation took place at Annam Brahma Restaurant in Queens, New York.</p>
<h2>Russell Wilson: I want to tell you that I felt that I had to see you. I read one of your books and some of your poems. I found them to be very inspiring. I felt that I needed to see you so I could learn from you.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very grateful to you for your kind letter. I understand that you have been practising meditation for a few years. I am very proud of you — of your mind's sincerity, clarity and luminosity and your heart's genuine love of God. Yours is a life of purity and self-giving oneness with the world of aspiration. For the few minutes that I was meditating with you here, I saw that you were very receptive. You have received what the divine within me wanted to offer you. For that I am very happy, very proud of you and very grateful to you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Russell Wilson: I am honoured, Sir. I can feel you so strongly that it is hard to talk. But it is a very pleasant and beautiful feeling. I am seeking inner peace, and I felt a very strong connection with you. If you would be accepting of me, I would like to learn from you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Russell Wilson: I am honoured, Sir. I can feel you so strongly that it is hard to talk. But it is a very pleasant and beautiful feeling. I am seeking inner peace, and I felt a very strong connection with you. If you would be accepting of me, I would like to learn from you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything is mutual. We cannot clap with one hand; we need two hands. Here also we are seeing the mutual acceptance of our two hearts. This acceptance can be made permanently illumining and fulfilling if you can remain beyond the domain of the earthbound mind. The heart establishes its oneness on the strength of its inner purity, beauty and divinity. But because the human mind has not yet been illumined by the light from Above or within, it tends to doubt the purity, beauty and divinity that we see and feel within our heart. Everything that is divine within us our own mind doubts.</p>
<p>Suppose one day early in the morning you have a very deep, sublime meditation. Immediately your mind may start to doubt it. "How could I have such a good meditation? It cannot be true. Yesterday I was in the vortex of politics, facing so many serious problems. So how is it possible today for me to be swimming in the sea of peace?" But the heart will say, "No! No matter how involved I am in the problems of the outer world, inside me there is something eternal and immortal, which remains unaffected." The heart always brings us the encouraging, inspiring and illumining message of the Beyond. The heart always reminds us of what we truly are in the inner world, whereas the human mind is all the time judging and criticising its own very limited capacity.</p>
<p>My request to you is that when you pray and meditate, keep the door to your mind completely shut and try to bring to the fore the light that you have inside your heart. Your heart-room is always filled with abundant light, so you should try to remain there as much as possible. Then, when God's Hour strikes, you will bring the light from your heart-room into your mind-room, which still needs illumination. The electrician has brought light into your heart-room. He has put wires there and connected them. Now the same electrician will go into the other room, your mind-room, and also bring light there. In this case, the electrician is your own soul. Once your mind-room is also lit, at that time your heart and your mind can work together.</p>
<p>While you are engaged in your multifarious daily activities, you have to use the mind. But while using the mind, please try to see how much sincerity is there, how much simplicity is there, how much purity is there. Each time you feel in your mind the presence of these and other divine qualities, your mind becomes more illumined. Eventually you will be able to bring the divinity of your heart into your mind, so that your mind will also be divinely illumined.</p>
<p>When you are not engaged in your daily activities, when you are praying and meditating, please try all the time to remain in your heart-room. The more you can remain in your heart-room, the more you will increase your inner beauty, your inner purity and your inner divinity. It is only by giving all importance to your heart in your spiritual life that you can be inwardly happy. If right now you cannot give one hundred per cent importance to your heart, then try to give it at least eighty or ninety per cent importance. Then, when the time comes, you will take the inner wealth that you have in your heart-room and place it inside your own mind-room.</p>
<p>If you take the inner wealth that you have inside your heart and bring it into your mind, your heart will not suffer. Far from it! In the outer life if you take something from one room and bring it to another room, then that thing is gone from its original place. But the wealth that you have inside the heart is boundless. The joy, the peace, the light, the love, the devotion to God and all the other divine qualities that you have inside your heart are limitless. If you take your heart's love and bring it into your mind, that love will only increase inside your heart. At every moment your heart-vessel is being replenished. The more the heart gives, the more the heart's receptivity increases, and the more of God's Divinity it is able to receive and hold.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do not feel that you have to go to the heart. Only feel that you <em>are</em> the heart. We use the term `heart-garden'. Inside our heart-garden are all our divine qualities. They are like beautiful and fragrant flowers. First, repeat to yourself, "I am inside my heart-garden." Try to see and feel all the beautiful flowers there. Then say, "I <em>am</em> my heart-garden. All the divine flowers inside my heart-garden are part and parcel of my own self." Up until now you have established your oneness with the reality that you see in your outer life. But now you want to establish your oneness with the dearest and purest existence of yours, which is your inner life, the life of your heart.</p>
<p>When you are meditating, if you happen to look at your shoulder or your knee, please say to yourself, "This is my heart." If you have a good thought during your meditation, then immediately inside that good thought try to feel the existence of your heart. But if you have a wrong thought, an uninspiring thought, immediately discard it. Have nothing to do with that kind of thought.</p>
<p><em>[There is a long, silent pause as Sri Chinmoy meditates.]</em></p>
<p>You have a very beautiful heart. I am not flattering you. Your heart's inner cry is very genuine. The more you can cry for God and shed streaming tears for God, the more your outer life will be able to shine and smile. Your outer existence has to be founded upon your inner existence — not the other way around. The inner existence is like the seed. The seed is inside you, inside the very depths of your heart-garden. So let us see how the seed germinates into a plant and then into a huge tree with most beautiful flowers and most delicious fruits.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> See her compassion! Some of us are physically sick, but many of us are mentally sick. When we do not love God, we are mentally sick. When we cannot love God, when we cannot do the right thing and do not want to become the right kind of person, then definitely our inner health is not very good.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As soon as U Thant saw me, he saw something in me and I saw something in him. His very first utterance to me was: "People have been telling me such nice things about you, and I see that it is absolutely true." Then we developed a genuine friendship. He was a Buddhist and I come from a Hindu family, but once we sincerely accept the spiritual life we go beyond the domain of religion. Religion is like a house. I live in my house and you live in your house. But we study together in the same school, and that school is our love of God. So he had transcended his religion and I had transcended my religion; our only religion was our love of God. He was my dear friend, an excellent friend. You also know of my love and admiration for my brother, Congressman Gary Ackerman.</p>
<p><em>Russell Wilson:</em> He feels the same way.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For years and years I have been basking in the sunshine of his affection. He is such a good friend, such a brother. Each time I think of Gary Ackerman's name, boundless love and boundless gratitude immediately fill my heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything depends on God's Hour. When the Hour strikes, we see the reality, we feel the reality and we become the reality. This song I composed many years ago in honour of Gary Ackerman. These students of mine will now sing it. They have come from all over the world to observe the anniversary of my arrival in America 29 years ago. They are from Great Britain, France, Austria, Japan and other places.</p>
