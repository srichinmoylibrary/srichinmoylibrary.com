<p>The experiences that he got from the teaching world, personal and otherwise, are at once shocking and illumining. <em>“Academic chairs are many, but wise and noble teachers are few,”</em> he said. Because poor Einstein was a stranger to formality, he lost his teaching post at a boarding school in 1902. It seems that the parents of the rich children there found it too difficult to put up with his wisdom-flooded informality. But again, there were highly advanced souls who found nothing wrong in his informal approach to the unfoldment of hidden realities. On the contrary, in Princeton and other places people later appreciated and admired his independent approach.</p>

<p>Joy is of paramount importance: joy within, joy without, joy in all spheres of life. How does one derive joy? One derives joy from a supreme art which a teacher possesses. When this supreme art the teacher offers to an individual, that particular individual becomes the possessor of joy. This offering is made through an awakening — the awakening in the student of a self-expressing creativity. Momentous is the prophetic utterance of the emperor-scientist: <em>“It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.”</em></p>

<p>Where is happiness? In the unmarried life? Most bachelors and spinsters are of the opinion that married people are happy. Again, married couples will be the first to declare that happiness can be found anywhere else, but not inside them. They feel that it is not even meant for them.</p>
<p>Love is not bad. It is divine. It can lift humanity high, higher, highest. But when it is misused, it is bound to descend along with those who are around it.</p>
<p>Whom do you love, how do you love and why do you love? If you can answer these questions properly and utilise the answers in your everyday life, then there can be no descent; there is only constant ascent. Otherwise, who can deny the undeniable gravitation-reality, especially in the consciousness-world, which is the soul-breath of God’s creation?</p>
<p>Once Einstein received a letter which was full of misconceptions about physics. The writer understood that because of gravity a person is sometimes upright, sometimes upside down and sometimes at right angles to the earth. He asked Einstein if it was while they were standing on their heads that people fell in love and did other foolhardy things. Einstein did not reply, but he wrote on the letter: <em>“Falling in love is not at all the most stupid thing that people do — but gravitation cannot be held responsible for it.”</em></p>

<p>There is no such thing as human authority. Human authority is nothing short of the bankruptcy of conscience and the nourishment of ignorance-hunger. In the truth-world there is only oneness, which is another name for all-illumining, all-guiding and all-fulfilling satisfaction.</p>
<p>Human authority and God’s irresistible laughter are inseparable. Einstein once wrote that over the entrance to the Marx-Lenin Institute in Moscow these words should be inscribed: <em>“In the realm of truth there is no human authority. Whoever attempts to play the autocrat incurs the laughter of the Gods.”</em></p>

<p>The wonder of wonders is his theory of relativity. This discovery opened up for humanity an all-illumining and all-fulfilling vision. It is such a serious, supremely important and supremely earth-fulfilling discovery. Yet at one point Einstein himself takes it in an amusing and light vein: <em>“When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems to him a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for only a minute — and it’s longer than an hour. That’s relativity.”</em></p>

<p>When one becomes great, one’s nationalism grows into internationalism and every nation claims one as its own, very own. But alas, when one brings discredit to one’s nation, that nation, even though it is one’s motherland or fatherland, does not hesitate to disown its son or daughter.</p>
<p>Einstein said, <em>“If my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.”</em></p>

<p>Einstein the immortal soul found it difficult to appreciate earthly pomp. A man of silence, he treasured the silence-life infinitely more than the sound-life which humanity had thrust upon him. When someone asked him who would be attending a university fund-raising banquet being held in honour of his seventy-fourth birthday, he remarked, <em>“One hundred distinguished guests, and I expect they will include the Ambassador from Mars.”</em></p>

<p>To our joy, Einstein’s humour does not stop with human beings. It includes poor God, too. Once, when Einstein had gone to visit a friend in the hospital, a large crowd gathered outside the hospital room just to see the scientist. A rabbi in the crowd was brave enough to approach Einstein personally, but Einstein didn’t mind. He said, <em>“You have rights. After all, you work for a very important boss.”</em></p>

<p>Who can stand on the same footing as Einstein in devouring his adversaries’ venomous criticism and offering in return a beaming smile that appreciated their insults? Once, when an organisation was formed in Berlin for the sole purpose of denouncing Einstein and his theories, Einstein himself came to its meeting and sat in the front row — even applauding several speakers who spoke against him.</p>

<p>The scientist Einstein enjoyed the humourist Einstein far beyond our imagination. At times, even before he offered his humour-world to others, he enjoyed it so much himself that it totally engulfed him. Naturally this produced boundless satisfaction and delight in his listeners.</p>
<p>The French writer Romain Rolland, who became very good friends with Einstein, told the world something highly significant about his friend. Extreme seriousness and extreme amusement were mutually happy and perfectly safe in the mind-home and heart-home of the scientist: <em>“He is very much alive and fond of laughter. He cannot help giving an amusing twist to the most serious thoughts. ”</em></p>

<p>Who can describe Einstein the humourist better than he himself? Unparalleled he remains in his own humour-life. The scientist-humourist once wrote the following letter to his eight-year-old niece, who was sad about not being able to see him when he was in town:</p>
<p><em>“I hear from Elsa that you are dissatisfied because you did not see your Uncle Einstein. Let me therefore tell you what I look like: pale face, long hair, and a tiny beginning of a paunch. In addition, an awkward gait, and a cigar in the mouth — if he happens to have a cigar — and a pen in his pocket or his hand. But crooked legs and warts he does not have, and so he is quite handsome — also no hair on his hands such as is often found on ugly men. So it is indeed a pity that you did not see me.</em></p>
<p><em>With warm greetings from Your Uncle Einstein.”</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part VIII: War and peace</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part VIII: War and peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>Einstein was a man of peace. Peace is the divine fulfilment of the enlightened sound-life. In this prophetic utterance, Einstein assuages humanity’s pangs, ameliorates humanity’s frustrations and awakens in humanity a new hope-dawn and fulfilment-noon: <em>“Mankind is now approaching an era in which peace treaties will not only be recorded on paper but will also become inscribed in the hearts of men.”</em></p>
<p>On another occasion, Einstein’s prophetic utterance was almost diametrically opposite. It, too, was founded upon his own experiences while journeying along earth-roads to Heaven-goals. The frustrated, bewildered, heartbroken scientist offers us this deplorable devastating yet undeniable statement: <em>“As long as there will be man, there will be wars.”</em></p>
<p>This world is not wanting in critics. Some critics or wiseacres and fools accused Einstein of bringing about the destructive release of atomic energy. But he vehemently denied it. <em>“I do not consider myself the father of the release of atomic energy. My part in it was quite indirect. I did not, in fact, foresee that it would be released in my time. I believed only that it was theoretically possible.”</em> The seer-scientist told the world, moreover, that the mere discovery of a nuclear world could not cause destruction. <em>“The discovery of nuclear chain reaction need not bring about the destruction of mankind any more than did the discovery of matches… To have security against atomic bombs… we have to prevent war.”</em></p>
<p>He never foresaw that his great discovery would be misused to such an extent that the world would suffer an unforgettable loss. If there is a choice between the tyranny of world government and the most powerful destruction-bomb, Einstein revealed, <em>“I fear the bomb more.”</em></p>
<p>The giver of wisdom and the lover of humanity in Einstein went far beyond human thoughts and ideas. <em>“The first atomic bomb destroyed more than the city of Hiroshima. It also exploded our inherited, outdated political ideas,”</em> he said.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IX: America and Israel</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IX: America and Israel" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>The body-consciousness of Einstein cried for liberty; his vital-consciousness, for tolerance; and his mind-consciousness, for equality. He realised that these divine qualities were not to be found in his birthplace, Germany, but in America. Therefore, he adopted American citizenship.</p>
<p>Brave he was to the core. From his brave utterances on America and Germany, our world of conflicting ideas and confusing thoughts can learn much: <em>“As long as I have any choice in the matter, I shall live only in a country where civil liberty, tolerance and equality of all citizens before the law prevail. Civil liberty implies freedom to express one’s political convictions, in speech and in writing; tolerance implies respect for the convictions of others, whatever they may be. These conditions do not exist in Germany at the present time. Men, among them leading artists, who have made a particularly great contribution to the cause of international understanding, are being persecuted there.”</em></p>
<p>Freedom he wanted; freedom he received in ample measure from America. While he enjoyed freedom in America, America’s admiration surcharged his. He was admired not only by those who understood or tried to understand him as a man of science, but also by those who were totally ignorant of science. He was admired, adored and loved because of his heart’s cosmopolitan outlook and his life’s universality-treasure.</p>
<p>Einstein made America supremely happy and America made him eternally happy. Here we see a mutual happiness. His vision turned into fulfilling reality, he felt, because of his stay in America. The American consciousness pleased him to such an extent that he cheerfully and dauntlessly voiced forth: <em>“I work here under the best imaginable working conditions, and I have never been so happy. I would rather live here than anywhere else in the world.”</em></p>
<p>The scientist-sage was very moved by America’s forward-looking attitude. America, because of its divinely childlike consciousness, always wants to become more powerful, more soulful, more self-giving and more fulfilling. It wants to grow and make progress, to proceed onward and dive deeply inward. Here movement means progress and progress means satisfaction. As Einstein so aptly expressed it, <em>“The American lives even more for his goals, for the future, than the European. Life for him is always becoming, never being.”</em></p>
<p>As a man of high aspirations himself, Einstein greatly appreciated President Wilson’s high ideas, higher ideals and highest goals. Einstein, nobility incarnate, said something most illumining about Wilson. He said that it is not the success but the attempt itself that deserves appreciation. <em>“That Wilson failed to carry out his ideas is beside the point. The enthusiasm with which his preachment was hailed demonstrated that the American public has an international mind.”</em></p>
<p>America’s pre-eminence was clearly recognised by Einstein. With true vision he saw how America stands in the vanguard of human success and progress. Him to quote: <em>“This country has through hard but peaceful labour achieved the position of undisputed pre-eminence among the nations of the world. Today it stands forth as the citadel of the ancient, high ideals of a political democracy.”</em></p>
<p>Einstein was extremely grateful to America. Only the possessor of a great soul can have a gratitude-heart and a gratitude-life: gratitude within and gratitude without. The gratitude-heart and gratitude-life of Einstein declared: <em>“My birthday affords me the welcome opportunity to express my feelings of deep gratitude for the ideal working and living conditions which have been placed at my disposal in the United States.”</em></p>
<p>The outer politics as such was not Einstein’s forte. His politics did not involve the supremacy of one party over another, but rather the oneness-manifestation of humanity’s oneness-heart.</p>
<p>Nothing outer could elevate his inner heights. Nothing outer could add to his inner glories. Therefore, it was so easy for him to decline even the supreme distinction of becoming the second President of Israel. When he was offered the post, he said, <em>“I am deeply moved by the offer from our state of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters; hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official functions. For these reasons alone I should be unsuited to fulfil the duties of that high office, even if advancing age was not making increasing inroads on my strength.”</em></p>
<p>His love for Israel can better be felt than described. His oneness-love for Israel did not allow him to lord it over Israel. His love was founded upon inner satisfaction and oneness-fulfilment. Indeed, the last speech he wrote before his death, although it was never delivered, was in support of Israel:</p>
<p><em>“I speak to you tonight as an American citizen and also as a Jew and as a human being who has always striven to consider matters objectively. What I am trying to do is simply to serve truth and justice with my modest strength.</em></p>
<p><em>You may think that the conflict between Israel and Egypt is a small and unimportant problem. We have more important concerns you might say. That is not the case. When it comes to truth and justice there is no difference between small and great problems. Whosoever fails to take small matters seriously in a spirit of truth, cannot be trusted in greater affairs....”</em></p>

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>His conviction was that nationalism is not the answer, but internationalism. Said Einstein: <em>“Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.”</em></p>
<p>Internationalism only can and will save the world. Some think it is from nationalism that one should eventually enter into internationalism. They feel that first one has to know what one is in one’s little self, and then only one will be able to know what one is in one’s larger self. But the scientist felt that we should think only of our higher self, our better self, our more illumining and more fulfilling self, for there alone lies our abiding satisfaction. Think not of what you are, but of what you eventually can become: this is his philosophy. Him to quote: <em>“I believe it is of utmost importance that everybody who is aware that necessity — not to speak of idealistic considerations — demands in the present condition of the world a greater unity of material and spiritual co-operation, should resolve never more to ask, ‘What can be done for my country?’ but much rather, ‘What must my country do to make it possible for the greater entity to exist?’”</em></p>
<p>Einstein firmly believed that it was essential to achieve oneness: <em>“I hold it to be of extreme consequence that wherever the possibility arises, men of different languages, of different political and cultural ideas, should get in touch with one another across their frontiers — not with the feeling that something might be squeezed out of the other for their and their country’s benefit, but with a spirit of good will to bridge the gap between the spiritual groups in comparatively independent spheres. Only thus can we hope to accomplish such a political unity [...] as will give us assurance of being able to survive economically and safeguard our spiritual existence. Only then will life be worth living.”</em></p>
<p>The scientist-prophet, humanity-lover and truth-server illumines the members of his world-family with his lovingly complete wisdom-authority. In an open letter to Sigmund Freud, Einstein said, <em>“The quest of international security involves the unconditional surrender by every nation, in a certain measure, of its liberty of action, its sovereignty, that is to say, and it is clear beyond all doubt that no other road can lead to such security.”</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The League of Nations</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The League of Nations" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The scientist in Einstein was so great that he far transcended his nationality. Therefore, it was so easy for the League of Nations to invite him to become a member of its Committee on Intellectual Co-operation even while his nation was begging for membership in the League. The illumining thoughts that he offered regarding this great incident awaken the sleeping life and illumine the suspecting mind of humanity.</p>
<p>The Committee sought to re-establish contacts disrupted by war, to report to the League on measures to be taken to facilitate intellectual exchanges, particularly scientific ones, among nations. Einstein agreed with this lofty goal. <em>“I consider it my duty to accept your invitation. In my opinion, no one, in times such as these, should refuse to participate in any effort made to bring about international co-operation,”</em> he said.</p>
<p>Later he wrote: <em>“These more enlightened men can make an important contribution to the great task of reviving international societies by keeping in close touch with like-minded men and women the world over, as well as by steadfastly championing the cause of internationalism in their own spheres of influence. Real success will require time, but eventually it will undoubtedly come... I am extremely hopeful for the progress of a general international organisation.”</em></p>
<p>When he expressed something, he expressed it unreservedly. When he rejected something, he rejected it vehemently. Sincerity always reigned supreme in his life. If he saw something good, illumining and fulfilling, then he immediately offered his heart and soul to manifest that particular thing. But if he saw something that failed to live up to its promise, then his indifference was also striking. When resigning from the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation of the League some months after its first meeting in August of 1922, Einstein said: <em>“I have become convinced that the League possesses neither the strength nor the good will necessary to accomplish its task. As a convinced pacifist it does not seem well to me to have any relation whatever with the League.”</em></p>
<p>Later he emphasised: <em>“I withdrew because the League of Nations, as it functions at present, not only does not embody the ideal of an international organisation but actually discredits such an ideal.... I did so, however, with great reluctance, because the hope has not yet quite died in me that, within the shell of the League of Nations as it exists today, a better institution may develop in time.”</em></p>
<p>Then again, when Einstein saw that his conviction had not been well-founded, that he had missed the point, he was more than willing to correct himself and try to manifest the abiding truth in the League of Nations. When asked to return to the Committee as a sign of rapprochement after his protest-resignation, Einstein accepted the invitation: <em>“I myself have slowly come to feel that I was influenced more by a passing mood of disillusionment than by clear thinking. True, so far the League has often failed; but, at a time as saddening as this, it must still be regarded as that institution which offers the best promise of effective action to those who honestly work for international reconciliation.”</em></p>
