<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> May I pray and meditate with you for a few minutes?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is wonderful; it is exactly what I would like.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A tiny drop of a musician has come to the ocean of the music-world. Please feel that the drop is most eagerly waiting to enter and merge into the ocean itself. You are the Himalayan musician and the supreme lover of music. I have read so much about you. I have heard so much about you. More than that, since I am a seeker I can also feel your heart. In the Almighty we are all one; we are sailing in the same boat. That is why I can easily identify myself with your heart and soul. You are not someone unknown to me; you are more than known.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How should I address you?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: In any way you wish. You are the master-musician; I am the beginner.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am so moved.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the capacity of two seekers we are serving the Supreme; we are sailing in the same boat. I must not dare to say a word to you about music, which is the universal language. Now we are praying and meditating. It is through our prayer and meditation that we please our Beloved Supreme. You are the ocean of music, and inside your music-world the world of aspiration and dedication is constantly growing. <em>(Sri Chinmoy and Leonard Bernstein meditate together.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy's comment: He was so deeply moved; he could not speak for a couple of minutes. Afterwards he grabbed my hands.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I have not done that in so long. I was taught transcendental meditation about four years ago. I did it as strictly as I could for seven weeks. But I could not continue it, so I lost it. Every once in a while I would come back to it. My mantra was always with me. But I have not done it for a very long time, and you brought that back.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">We are one</h2><span property="dc:title" content="We are one" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are one. We are sailing in the same boat. Our Beloved Father Supreme is manifesting Himself in and through us. You have offered to the world at large something unique, and the outer world knows who you are because of the magnificence of your unique contribution. The inner world, which is your heart's cry and your implicit faith in your Beloved Supreme, offers you constant oneness with the will of the Supreme. For that the outer world does not yet know you. But the golden day will dawn when the Supreme Message which you embody in the inner world will come to the fore. At that time the world will see you as the supreme seeker who is also the supreme composer and conductor. God the Lover aspect, which you embody in boundless measure, has yet to come to the fore. In your writings and in your compositions the world gets an iota of what you truly are inwardly. But I know how much the message of the inner world, which you embody, will come to the fore. Along with your music, it will inundate the world of aspiration and dedication.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I don't know how many years more I have to do that. That worries me, because I do have a lot to do. You are right. I have only begun, but I am sixty years old.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the Heart of our Beloved Supreme, sixty years is nothing. It is a fleeting second. Again, in a fleeting second you can inundate your entire being with infinite peace, light and bliss. The promise that your soul has made to the Supreme you are bound to fulfil. Your soul will not be satisfied unless and until you have offered to the world at large everything that you are supposed to offer and everything that you are.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is what I try to do. But there is so little time. Maybe I love people too much. I have so many friends and people I love.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are loving them because you see in them the living embodiment of your Beloved Supreme. Sri Ramakrishna was a great spiritual Master. His dearest disciple, Swami Vivekananda, once asked his Master, "Why do you always think of me? Why do you speak to me so much and why do you always show me so much affection?" Sri Ramakrishna replied, "I see God Himself in you. If I see an ordinary, unaspiring person, then I will not look at him." In the same way, you have so many friends, admirers and adorers. But you do not see them as ordinary human beings who are full of ignorance. You see them as God's representatives, as God's own creation. When you look at them and talk to them, you see in them the living Presence of your Beloved Supreme. So what you have been doing is most important. The Supreme has chosen you to be His supreme instrument in the music-world and in the spiritual world.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How do you know that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A God-seeker knows everything; a God-lover knows everything.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> There are many wonderful musicians in the world who are much greater than I.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all! That is again your humility speaking. The Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has given you some capacity. On the strength of my oneness with my Inner Pilot, I know who you are. To be very frank with you, you do not know who you are. I know more than you do, infinitely more than you do, about you in the inner world. About your outer life, you know. But you do not know your real inner self.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I feel it, though.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A roaring lion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A roaring lion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inside you is a roaring lion, but that roaring lion is encaged. It is roaring there, but it is unable to come out. As soon as it comes out, then only will it be able to roar properly and manifest what it has within.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Why is it encaged?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why is it encaged? I have to be very frank with you. If you could devote a little more time to the inner world...</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I thought you would say that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am so happy you said that. I spend so much time with the outer world.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have the key, but right now you are not using the key. The door is right in front of you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> There are so many aspects of the outer world that are spiritual, that are golden. My children are part of the outer world. I spend a great deal of time with my children, for example.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Keats said, "Beauty is truth and truth, beauty." He also said, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." In your writings I see that beauty and truth are inseparable. That is what you are manifesting all the time. In your case, I see that it is all beauty and truth, and they are interlinked. It is like Walt Whitman's theory in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. There is no difference between body and soul. You have realised the inseparable oneness between spirit and matter, between the Creator and the creation.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Now you see, that takes a great deal of time.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But you have done it. Only you have done it in the inner world; in the outer world it takes time. In the inner world you know that you are the supreme musician.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is so hard to accept. I cannot take that responsibility.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is good.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it would not offend me at all. If that is your nature, then why should it offend me?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You do not smoke, I am sure.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my oneness with you, how am I going to say that it is something wrong if it pleases you?</p>

<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course! How many are there? How many students did you bring?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to forgive me, I think there are seventeen or eighteen. One of my students has come from France. He is the conductor. He is the greatest admirer of yours. His name is Olivier Greif. I have given him the name Haridas.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> He is the boy I know from Tanglewood. He studied with me last time. He is young.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is a young man, a very young conductor. And he has been shining in France of late. So this is the song. First they will sing the melody which I have composed, and then they will sing in rounds.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> An arrangement?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please feel my most sincere gratitude. It is most kind of you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How can you think that? It has to be the other way. You are the boundless energy and stillness all at the same time. How can you say that? I am the drop.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you are the ocean and I am the drop. Would it be possible for my students to have one or two pictures with you?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Or is it forbidden by the secretary? They say that you do not want any photographers to come and take pictures.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, of course you can! Am I allowed to drink alcohol? Am I?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can do anything you like.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I did not expect that.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My oneness with you will never permit me to interfere with you in this way.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But maybe it will be a bad influence on your students.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That may be, but nothing will bother me.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am ashamed when I have to have a drink. I love your face.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I love your soul and I love your entire existence on earth and in Heaven. You love my face. I love your soul, heart, mind, vital and body. I love your oneness with Mother-Earth and your oneness with Father-Heaven.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> The flowers you brought me must be put in water. They are so beautiful. How I wish my wife were here! She would have been so moved. She died a few months ago. She was the most beautiful woman in the world, unique.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How old was she?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Forty-one. But she looked much younger and she was much younger inside. She was really a creature of God. I have this. I want to give it to you. It is an scarf I bought in India. I like it very much. I want you to have it. It is blue. <em>(First Sri Chinmoy tied the scarf around his neck in what he later described as a "funny, crazy way." Leonard Bernstein did not say anything, but untied and rearranged the scarf, and then embraced Sri Chinmoy.)</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Blue is spirituality. This colour blue represents spirituality and Infinity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please be seated. This is the place where we meditated together.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Yes, this is our place. This is where we sat. I don't believe this series of presents! He gave me the flowers and I thought, "This is too much!" The flowers are just too beautiful; they smell so beautiful. Then came that poem, the song which you are going to sing. And now what, my Lord! <em>(Sri Chinmoy presents Leonard Bernstein with a plague containing the words and music to his "Leonard Bernstein" song, and Leonard Bernstein starts humming the song.)</em> I can't wait to hear it! What's all this? Incredible! I don't know what to say. I won't say anything.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In oneness there is nothing to be said. Oneness we only feel and manifest. Nothing fulfils us but to feel and become and remain always one.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Who are you all?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These are my students.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You do various things? You're not all connected with the UN?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of them work at the United Nations.</p>
<p><em>(Choir sings "Leonard Bernstein " song.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> What music I hear! Beautiful! When did you learn that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just last night.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> When?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Last night.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Last night? Oh, come on!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The whole night.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> We studied all last night and finished at six this morning.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How incredible! You all look so fresh. You all went to your jobs this morning perfectly healthy and breathing and not falling asleep? What power, my God, what power this man gives you! That is incredible. Did anybody have a tape machine going?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you do not mind, they will be more than willing to sing it once again. We do not want to intrude on your valuable time.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Can you stand there and then sing it again?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can, easily.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, it is just incredible! He said there was going to be some kind of 'round'. I didn't know what a 'round' exactly was; I was waiting for the tune in a round. I waited. I had no idea!</p>

<p><em>Peter (Leonard Bernstein's assistant):</em> Can you wait a second?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am waiting, infinitely patient. <em>(Taking Haridas' hand)</em> Olivier, c'est incroyable, ce que tu as fait! <em>(They continue speaking in French.)</em></p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> Mr. Bernstein just said that Guru writes divine counterpoint.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> He has no idea he is writing counterpoint. <em>(To Sri Chinmoy)</em> If I say 'counterpoint' to you, you will ask what that is. <em>(To the group)</em> But he has written a counterpoint like Bach. Every phrase goes with every other phrase, so that no matter what you do, you can't miss. That doesn't mean he <em>(indicating Haridas)</em> has not worked very hard to make the right things go with the right things. I am so impressed, I can't say! My ego is not impressed at all, but my musical spirit is very, very deeply impressed.</p>
<p>It is incredible the way you sing. And not one embarrassed face! That is what I was looking for. Usually when people come to sing for me, they blush, they look embarrassed, they kick their shins, they worry if they sing a wrong note. But you are all just so incredibly relaxed and full of breath! You are very lucky people; you know that, of course. I am very lucky now, too.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am also lucky to have them.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Of course, how many more of them are there?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have about seven hundred students.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Seven hundred! He works only in astronomical numbers! How many paintings? It was one hundred thousand last year.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> One hundred and thirty thousand.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You mean he has painted thirty thousand pictures since that celebration of one hundred thousand! I wish I could have attended that night, but I couldn't. Our meeting had to be put off until today. What a perfect day it is today! It's the first day of spring. It has been so many years since the first day of spring has looked like the first day of spring. I can't remember how long — at least ten years since we have had a perfect March 21. And it was Bach's birthday last night and it's my mother's birthday tomorrow. So Bach and you and my mother and all these beautiful kids, and spring: God, that's too much!</p>
<p>Where are you going to sit? Sit down on the floor somewhere. Please rest yourselves for a minute. I cannot bear you all standing so. That's better. While we are waiting for Peter to set up, let's be silent together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This what we do at the United Nations.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I am very happy to have this.

Wouldn't you like some drinks? How about some ginger ale? How about some soft drinks? All right, all soft drinks!</p>
<p><em>(The Singers perform the song once more.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> This should be the greatest ego trip anybody had. But it is not the way I feel at all. I am not even that impressed by the lyrics, but I am so impressed by you all. You have turned my heart over! You all read music? You are incredible! You sound like an absolutely A-1 professional choir. I don't know if this is the result of meditating or the result of practice. I guess it is a combination of both. Incredible! I don't know how you do it. I am baffled. Very good!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (while leaving):</em> We wish to invite you to the United Nations to our Meditation Group. Whenever you are free, I will be so deeply honoured if you could come to our Meditation Group.</p>

<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> In July I am in Tanglewood. I am teaching and conducting the Boston Symphony and I am teaching students.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Will the first week of August be possible?</p>

<p><em>On 28 March 1979, just seven days after their first meeting, a messenger arrived with a personal gift to Sri Chinmoy from Leonard Bernstein. The gift was an original manuscript of a song about Sri Chinmoy which the Maestro had composed in his own hand. It was inscribed:</em></p>
<p><em>"Profound thanks to Sri Chinmoy and his forty angel-voices (Olivier, Archangel) from Leonard Bernstein, 28 March 1979." It is a musical piece for sitar, flute, tabla, bass and drone and is based on the Indian raga "Bahar" which honours the coming of spring. The words to the song are:</em></p>

<p>"Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy,<br /> Free in joy!<br /> Thank you, thank you, Sri Chinmoy-<br /> You brought Leonard Bernstein joy."</p>

<p><em>On 11 September 1986 Sri Chinmoy once more visited Leonard Bernstein at the Dakota Building, where the Maestro lived in Manhattan. First they met privately in Mr. Bernstein's study and then came into the living room to hear a performance by the Sri Chinmoy choir. Following are excerpts from the meeting.</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Aren't you ladies beautiful! Why don't the men have robes, too? They have to have ties and look like bank clerks, and the women look so ravishing in saris. Six years ago there were 40 of you, and now you are just a select few. <em>(Jokingly)</em> Did the others defect, or is it just that you are the choice ones?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are the choicest. We have not fired anybody.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> So nobody defected; nobody went over to the other side. Well, Master, where do you want me?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please sit here.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Then I cannot see the conductor. Oh good, now this is fine. I have to feel your biceps now, Sri Chinmoy! You do one-arm weightlifting. I have received a whole book on your weightlifting.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> He has lifted 300 pounds with one arm.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> 300 pounds! Through meditation and the love of God, of course!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Love of God and prayer.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Well, this is extraordinary! You have been rehearsing all night?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> This time we had a few days.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh good! The last time I remember you stayed up all night.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> It is amazing that you remember that.</p>

<p><em>Leonard Bernstein (looking at the song pamphlet):</em> Are you going to sing all these songs?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. It will not take much time.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> No, I am not worried about the time. I am just worried about the endless energy. I don't know why. I smoke, drink and do everything bad. Am I allowed to have a drink?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein (to the Singers):</em> You have been waiting so patiently. I didn't know you were here. Nobody told me you were coming. Where did you wait — outside in the street?</p>
<p><em>DISCIPLES:</em> In the park.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> That is incredible. Okay, let's go! Shoot!</p>
<p><em>(Singers perform "The Leonard Bernstein Cantata," a 25 minute arrangement by Haridas Greif of Sri Chinmoy's original song which was performed for Leonard Bernstein at their first meeting.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Unbelievable! How did you remember all that? I hope that this time it was recorded. The last time — do you remember — you finished and someone said, "Gee, it's a pity we didn't record that!"</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> It is recorded. We have made a tape. <em>(He gives Mr. Bernstein the tape. Then Sri Chinmoy presents Mr. Bernstein with a plaque.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Goodness, O my God! I haven't got any more wall space to hang these. And who is that young fellow <em>(pointing to his own picture in the plaque)?</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The eternal child!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I hope so. If that ever goes away, then I will give up. I'll have to find a place for this. I am so grateful. I can't get over it. You talk about perfection. You cannot learn a song like that in a couple of days. Is it like weightlifting? Through meditation you can do everything — even remember 30 minutes of variations and notes!</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> Let's hope it did not seem that long.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I have been rehearsing all day with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. They have the notes in front of them. When I tell them that something has to be this way, they see what it is and they write it in. But they have the notes. You have nothing in front of you except your spirits and your brains. I don't know, I have never seen such a phenomenon of memory. How does it work? Somebody explain it to me.</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> I think you have the answer near you <em>(pointing to Sri Chinmoy)</em>.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein (to Sri Chinmoy):</em> You!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I teach the life of prayer and meditation. When we pray and meditate, there is no such thing as impossibility. Just three days ago I told them, "You will not be allowed to read the music." So in three days they memorised everything.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But there is something else in what you just said, which is a certain divine authority.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the strength of my oneness with them, I know they have the capacity. It is my oneness-authority. I will not ask someone in the street to do this. But these people pray with me and meditate with me; they are part and parcel of my aspiration-life. It is all a sweet little family. As the head of the family, I tell them that this is what will give me joy, and out of love they do it. They belong to me and I belong to them.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> The relationship is so deep and strong.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have the same goal: perfection in life, perfection in action; perfection is satisfaction. Perfection and satisfaction cannot be separated. If there is perfection, then there is satisfaction. This is what your life is. These are the words.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> This is what I try for. <em>(Looking at the music score)</em> I need glasses to see this. I love the fast tempo. Last time you did it much slower. It is a great idea and it has such energy.</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> It is your energy that is portrayed.</p>
<p><em>(Singers perform the songs that Sri Chinmoy has written to Leonard Bernstein's words.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How did you remember all that? It gets more and more imponderable. I do not understand it. I do, but I just cannot believe it. There are only two words I cannot bear anymore: one is 'Leonard' and the other one is 'Bernstein.' I would love to lose that identity completely!</p>
