<p><em>Earth is never quite prepared for a true God-realised soul. As children will chase after a meteor that falls from the sky, all the divine and undivine forces of this world seem drawn to him. Thus, on both the inner plane and the outer plane, a Master's biography is a unique and wondrous thing.</em></p>
<p><em>In this unusual book, the great spiritual teacher Sri Chinmoy describes some of the ordinary and not-so-ordinary experiences he has had while travelling in different places. They form part of the memorabilia that a Master from another reality has collected during his stay on earth — like the pebbles and shells a child might pick up on a visit to the seashore. In the case of a God-realised soul, however, such treasures belong to all humanity, and the reader is invited to marvel, laugh and commiserate with him as he recalls these stories from his human past. It is a rare opportunity, divinely illumining and supremely fulfilling.</em></p>

<p>As I was coming out of the plane at the Eugene, Oregon airport, there was an old man with a cane right in front of me. With his right hand he was holding the rail, and he was dragging his legs. I was behind him doing the same because of all my back pain and leg pain. He turned around, mad, and said, "What are you doing?" He thought I was mocking him. He said he was 76 years old. I said that I was not mocking him, only I had leg pain. He believed me.</p>
<p>When I got to the motel, I went to the gift shop to buy some candy. The saleslady started to talk to me. She was saying, "How are you? Did you have a nice day?" and other things. Salespeople like to talk to everyone, so I didn't think she was talking to me because she knew who I was. I only smiled at her.</p>
<p>When I gave her a dollar for the candy, she gave me back a quarter. Then she said that she had gone to one of my meditations once, and had seen me meditating in my dhoti. Now I was in western clothes. So she said, "You know how to fool everyone."</p>

<p>When I arrived at the airport in New York from Puerto Rico, I was carrying two small bags, one on each shoulder. L. and R. were watching me from the other side of the glass partition. I saw them, but they could not come inside.</p>
<p>One of the porters recognised me, saying, "Sri Chinmoy, you are such a great man! You have to carry two bags?" He wanted to carry my bags for me, but they were such tiny bags! He was not a runner, I am sure, since he was quite fat, so I don't think he knew me from our races. I was looking at my shirt to see if 'Sri Chinmoy' was mentioned anywhere, but it wasn't. How did he recognise me? God alone knows!</p>

<p>This morning I had to telephone someone. I could not dial directly from here, so I had to take help from the telephone operator. She was an elderly lady who was very, very kind to me. When I gave her the number, she said to me, "Thank you."</p>
<p>So I said to her, "Thank you."</p>
<p>Then she said to me very affectionately, in a motherly way, "When someone says 'Thank you', you are not supposed to say 'Thank you'! You are supposed to say, 'You're welcome'!"</p>
<p>I thanked her for telling me that, and then she started laughing and laughing.</p>

I told a policeman and he laughed, but he made the boys come back. I said that I needed only one fellow. Afterwards I found out that when you give the porters money, it goes to the police.</p>

<p>On this trip the Italians were so bad to me! It started at the airport, where all my luggage was missing. Even when I was in a taxi on the way to see the Pope, the taxi driver took me out of my way. The Vatican was in sight, but the driver, thinking I wouldn't recognise it, went somewhere else. The ride never ended!</p>
<p>In Italy the churches are very beautiful. But when you go to a church, five or six photographers will take your picture and then try to sell you the photographs.</p>

<p>Once I went to Bermuda for three days alone. The hotel I stayed in was near the water. It was very beautiful. But it rained heavily the whole time I was there. I could not even go out. It rained cats and dogs. Only once I went across the street to a Chinese restaurant. My only consolation was that I wrote two hundred poems while I was there. But I was not able to go out walking or running at all!</p>

<p>I have many good things to say about France, but each time I go there, I have to lose something — or perhaps I should say they have to steal something! Once they stole my harmonium and another time they took my tape recorder. I had left a tape recorder right on the dresser in my room. As soon as we reached the airport, only fifteen minutes later, I called the hotel and said that one of my students was coming back for the tape recorder. The manager said he would send someone up to see if it was there. After a few minutes he said that there was nothing on the dresser in my room — as if my mind would go blank in fifteen minutes!</p>

<p>In India, the hotel people show you a room and say that all the rooms are the same. So you pay for a room, leave your bags in the car and go out for two or three hours. When you come back, O God, the room they take you to is unbelievable. Compared to the room they showed you, it is the difference between Heaven and hell. It is on the same floor as the other room, but there is such a difference!</p>

<p>At the Calcutta airport, quite unexpectedly Mother Teresa and I met face to face. For me to recognise her was a very easy task. But she didn't give any sign of recognising me. For a fleeting second she looked at me and I looked at her. We were only three metres from each other. She was travelling with only three attendants, and they were all wearing saris. Usually I have quite a few attendants around me, although this time I had nobody.</p>
<p>Then again at the Delhi airport we passed by each other. But it happened so quickly that I barely noticed her. Then I saw three or four people come up to her for her autograph.</p>

<p>Indian taxi drivers are notorious for deceiving people. On this trip deception started at the Bombay airport. From the airport to the hotel is a very short distance. The taxi ride normally costs only seven rupees, but the driver asked for two hundred rupees. I started arguing with him in Hindi. Perhaps I made some grammatical mistakes, but he understood me perfectly. From two hundred he finally came down to sixty. So I gave him sixty rupees. What could I do? The following morning, when I went from the hotel to the airport, another driver charged me the correct amount — seven rupees. So you can see what a rogue the first driver was!</p>

<p>The following day, while I was waiting to board the plane to Madras, I was writing poems. After some time I put my notebook on the seat next to me and began meditating. Suddenly I noticed that my notebook had disappeared. I started asking myself, "Where did it go?"</p>
<p>I looked for the notebook in my blue bag, but it was not there. Then I started looking around me. There were about seventy or eighty people waiting to get on the plane, and it was almost boarding time. Then I saw that somebody was holding the notebook. He was not reading the poems; he was only appreciating the beautiful parrot that was on the cover.</p>
<p>I said to him, "Excuse me, this is my book."</p>
<p>He said, "Your book? I found it on a seat. Nobody was sitting there, so I took it because I liked the bird."</p>
<p>Fortunately I got my notebook back at the last minute. Otherwise, ninety-nine poems would have been lost.</p>
