<p>As a national figure Tagore was among the very few true Reformers of India; as an international one he was a genuine messenger of beauty, love and peace.</p>
<p>From his life-long activities we observe that reforms must begin or come from within, and not from without.</p>

<p>Tagore's name received unimaginable fame through the length and breadth of the world, while his heart received tremendous blows one after another. How difficult it was for him to put his sufferings aside! His wife expired when she was on the right side of forty, and some of his children died quite young. Moreover, death snatched away some of his devoted young admirers who, he had thought, would add much to the glory of Bengal. Curiously enough, all these bereavements occurred in the course of three successive years. So Tagore once remarked that to live a long life is not at all a blessing.</p>
<p>A memorable event: we all know that Tagore breathed his last on August 7, 1941. In that very year, on May 6, 1941, his 80th birthday had been celebrated all over the world. On this occasion Mahatma Gandhi's greeting ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Four-score is not enough. May you finish five! Love."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore's immediate reply was: "Thank you for your message, but four-score is impertinence. Five-score would be intolerable."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Religion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Religion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>No religion is absolutely perfect. Yet not only do we fight for religion, but also are we often willing to sacrifice our lives for it. And what we hopelessly fail to do is to live it. A true religion is that which has no caste, no creed, no colour. It is but an all-uniting and all-pervading embrace.</p>
<p>"Religion," Tagore says, "is not a fractional thing that can be doled out in fixed weekly or daily measures as one among various subjects in the school syllabus. It is the truth of our complete being, the consciousness of our personal relationship with the infinite; it is the true centre of gravity of our life." — Personality</p>
<p>Let me cite one of his acute observations on religion from the <em>Modern Review,</em> December 1917. He writes: "If religion, instead of being the manifestation of a spiritual ideal, gives prominence to scriptures and external rites, then does it disturb the peace more than anything else."</p>
<p>We may perhaps say that Tagore's religion is the religion of humanity which comprises all that is superb in all the religions.</p>

<p>Russia was immensely impressed by the unique personality of Tagore. And the poet also appreciated considerably her great stress on education. In one of his letters he writes: "I wish to let you know how I have been impressed by the amazing intensity of your energy in spreading education among the masses. I appreciated it all the more keenly because I belong to the country where millions of my fellow countrymen are denied the light that education can bring them. You have recognised the truth that in extirpating all social evils one has to go to the root, which can only be through education."</p>

<p>"Shantiniketan is India." This high tribute was paid to Tagore not by an insignificant human being, but by the father of the Nation, Gandhi-ji. And our Prime Minister went the length of saying that "he who has not visited Shantiniketan has not seen India."</p>
<p>Although many have worked and many will continue to work for Shantiniketan, we can safely say that Shantiniketan is a one-man University. Viswabharati is surely an invitation to the remotest corner of the world. It is a cheerful sacrifice to attain to the all-fulfilling truth of mankind. Now let us quote Tagore: "It has been my steadfast endeavour, that the boys of my Shantiniketan school should acquire a true vision of the history of humanity as a whole, broad and untainted with our race-hatred."</p>

<p>Similarly, Tagore is I; his creative genius has the power to be we. The well-known scientist Meghnad Saha fervently hoped that Tagore, like Goethe, would turn to science. "May we not hope that, like his illustrious predecessor Goethe, he [Tagore] will turn for a while to modern science, and give expression in his inimitable poetry to the Hope behind the invading despair and the Harmony behind the modern Babel of jarring voices. — (From <em>The Golden Book of Tagore</em>)</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Song</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Song" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Rabindranath was the world-song sung by the Singer in him. A golden chain of beauty and love did come into existence from this world-song to bind the two extremities of the globe, the East and the West.</p>
<p>But Rabindranath once said that, when he was capable of singing, his own compositions were very few, but when he became a prolific composer of songs his voice failed him.</p>
<p>And here is a prophetic utterance of Tagore about his own songs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With the march of time everything changes. But I can definitely say that my songs will have a considerably greater stability. Especially the Bengalis will have no other alternative but to sing my songs in the hours of their sorrow, grief, joy and delight. They needs must sing these songs epoch after epoch.</p>
<p>— Translated from <em>Alapchari Rabindranath</em> by Rani Chandra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tagore burst into fame with more than two thousand songs. In the West Schubert comes second with six hundred or so.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot help reproducing here a few momentous words from Tagore's <em>Fruit Gathering.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To the birds you gave songs, the birds gave you songs in return. You gave me only voice, yet asked for more, and I sing."</p>

<p>It happened that several times Tagore, leaving his home, resorted to solitude to produce unique poems. Curiously enough, his desire was not fulfilled in the least. He had to return home. And his realisation was that to write something unique it is the state of the mind that counts the most and not the place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To Sorrow I bade good-morrow, And thought to leave her far away behind; But cheerly, cheerly, She loves me dearly: She is so constant to me, and so kind."</p>
<p>— Keats <em>Endymion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorrow helps us immensely. It is apt to humble our pride. It chastens us. It opens our hearts to magnanimity and sympathy. To check our innumerable errors and make us watch ourselves and put us on the road to perfection, sorrow must necessarily exist in the world.</p>
<p>How beautiful and penetrating are the following lines of Tagore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>"The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will hang upon thy breast.</p>
<p>"Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace. " <em> — Gitanjali</em></p>

<p>Nolini Kanta Gupta, whose contribution to Bengali literature, according to Tagore, is unique, observes about Socrates and Tagore thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Socrates is said to have brought down philosophy from heaven to live among men upon earth. A similar exploit may be ascribed to Tagore. The Spirit, the bare transcendental Reality contemplated by the orthodox Vedantins, has been brought nearer to our planet, close to human consciousness, in Tagore's vision, being clothed in earth and flesh and blood, made vivid with the colours and contours of the physical existence. The Spirit, yes by all means, but not necessarily asceticism and monasticism. So Tagore boldly declared in those famous lines of his: 'Mine is not the deliverance achieved through mere renunciation. Mine, rather, the freedom that tastes itself in a thousand associations.'"</p>

According to him, we can never cut asunder all the ties of the world. We can, however, exceed them. And that is possible only if we sincerely admit their reality and pass through them.</p>
