  <h2 id="page-title">Oneness-reality and perfection-divinity</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Oneness-reality and perfection-divinity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Oneness-reality and perfection-divinity are two paths to the Supreme. A seeker can accept either the way of oneness-reality or the way of perfection-divinity, or he can try both; for they both lead to the selfsame Goal.</p>
<p>When the seeker wants to walk along the road of oneness-reality, he starts with simplicity. He tries to simplify his life. Then there comes a time when he feels that his simplicity is not enough. For in spite of his simplicity, he may make mistakes. Again, although he commits Himalayan blunders, he will still make progress. But if he is not sincere, then he will not be able to make any progress. Therefore, he has to become sincere. With his sincerity he makes considerable progress and gets joy from both the inner world and the outer world.</p>
<p>Then there comes a time when the seeker sees and feels that even his sincerity is not enough. In spite of his sincerity, he can still make mistakes, and he may not have the necessary determination to rectify his mistakes. So in addition to his sincerity, what he needs is determination. With his determination he will always try to stop doing the wrong thing, start doing the right thing and continue doing the right thing. Simplicity is not enough. Sincerity is not enough. What the seeker needs at this stage of his evolving consciousness is determination. Determination is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The seeker makes satisfactory progress with his determination. But there comes a time when he sees that his determination is mainly in the vital plane. It is principally in the domain of the dynamic vital, if not the aggressive vital. Sometimes with his determination he builds something; then in no time he breaks it. So the seeker feels that determination is not enough. Inside his determination something else has to loom large, and that thing is purity. If he has purity, then his heart will be able to receive the message from Above. He will be able to act like a divine child. A child is a flower that is blossoming petal by petal in the heart of his parents. A childlike purity always obeys the inner voice and, if one obeys the inner voice, then one can never commit mistakes. So determination is not enough. Purity is of paramount importance for the seeker to make considerable progress. If his heart is pure, if his very existence is pure, then he is able to make most satisfactory progress.</p>
<p>But, at times, purity is not used properly, divinely and supremely. At times, a pure person may be afraid of the world. He sees the animal creation all around, so he is frightened to death. He feels that these human animals will devour him; therefore, a pure person at times wants to enter into the Himalayan caves. He does not want to remain in society, for he fears that the society-tiger will devour him. Again, a pure person, unless and until he is perfect, may cherish a sense of superiority. He may look down upon those who are impure, and he may not want to be in the company of impure people. He may want to shun society as such in order to maintain his own purity. So purity is not enough. He needs something more than purity. He needs oneness.</p>
<p>Oneness can be limited or complete. If oneness is limited, then satisfaction is also limited. If oneness is partial, then naturally satisfaction will be partial. Oneness can be conditional or unconditional. The seeker can establish his oneness with the Lord Supreme on the strength of their mutual give and take. He will give his aspiration cry, the inner mounting flame, and in return he will expect something infinitely more meaningful, fruitful and valuable from Above—that is, God’s infinite Bounty, infinite Light and infinite Delight. When the seeker has his conditional oneness, he cannot be truly happy. He can be truly happy only when he establishes his complete and unconditional oneness. Only when he establishes his oneness with the Inner Pilot soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally does he become truly happy. And happiness is satisfaction. The road of unconditional oneness eventually leads the seeker to the world of Delight, boundless Delight, where the seeker-lover becomes inseparably one with the Beloved, the Source.</p>
<p>The other road that the seeker may follow is the road of perfection-divinity. When the seeker wants to walk along the road of perfection-divinity, he starts with imagination. He imagines God’s Reality. He imagines God with attributes and without attributes, God with form and God without form. But sometimes he may fall prey to false mental fascination. He may be assailed at times by doubts and think that he is building castles in the air. Therefore, he feels that his imagination is not enough. What he needs is inspiration. With his inspiration he will dive deep within. He will fly above. He will march and run forward. He is inspired to do something, to become something. Inspiration has very limited capacity. In order to do something or become something divinely and supremely, inspiration is not enough. One must needs have aspiration. When the seeker aspires, he feels that he has to climb up or reach a certain destination. He sees that now he is at the starting point, whereas the goal is somewhere else. He feels that there is a yawning gulf between his present existence-reality and the ultimate Goal which he is aiming at. So he climbs up the aspiration-tree, which is tall, taller, tallest. When he aspires sincerely, soulfully and unconditionally, he reaches a lofty height.</p>
<p>But his aspiration is not enough. He knows that he has to go through aspiration, but aspiration is not enough. He feels that he must have realisation. He feels that realisation will be able to solve all his problems, because wherever realisation is, the Ultimate Truth is also there. Once he realises the Ultimate Truth, there will be no starting point and no final Goal. It will all be one. Realisation and the Ultimate Truth cannot be separated from each other or from the one who has realised the Truth. The realisation and the seeker who has realised are inseparably one. Therefore, the seeker longs for realisation. Only realisation, his self-discovery, will be able to solve his life’s problems that have caused so much suffering for him from time immemorial.</p>
<p>At last the seeker realises God. He is happy. His progress has been unimaginable. But there comes a time when he feels the insufficiency of his own realisation. As an individual, he is one with God. But when he looks around, he sees that there are millions and billions of his fellow beings — brothers and sisters of his — who are not yet realised. He sees clearly that he is eating most delicious food while these others are starving. In the inner world, they are poverty-stricken. His heart of oneness-realisation feels miserable. So he wants to go one step farther. He wants to reveal to the hungry humanity the Truth, the Light and the Delight that he embodies. This is not a desire to display his achievements but a supreme necessity, an inner urge. His Inner Pilot compels him to bring forward what he has within in order to show the world that, like him, each individual is entitled to realise the Highest. He does not want to eat the realisation-fruit alone. This realisation-fruit has to be eaten by all those who sincerely long for it. So realisation is not enough. Revelation is also a supreme necessity.</p>
<p>The God-realised soul reveals what he has so that others can get inspiration, aspiration and realisation. He reveals without what he has within. He feels that his divinity can be revealed on any plane — on a higher plane, on a lower plane, anywhere. But unless it has its proper roots, it cannot last for long; it cannot be the achievement of Mother Earth for Eternity. Therefore, his revelation is not enough. He needs manifestation. Once something is manifested here on earth, it becomes the permanent possession of Mother Earth. Once divinity, reality or any divine qualities are properly manifested, then they are permanent. They become part and parcel of Mother Earth. They become the possession of humanity’s aspiration. So the God-realised seeker tries to manifest. And when he manifests, he feels his complete oneness with the Absolute Pilot and becomes the perfect instrument of Divinity’s Perfection. Being a perfect instrument of his Beloved Supreme, the seeker tries to manifest the divinity with which he has been entrusted.</p>
<p>Here the oneness-reality becomes one with the perfection-divinity. When one becomes perfect, one automatically becomes one with the supreme Reality, the Source. When one has established one’s inseparable, unconditional oneness with the Source, then one is bound to become perfect. These are the two roads, the road of oneness and the road of perfection. Eventually they join and, at that time, the seeker reaches the highest Height and the deepest Depth, and becomes the perfect instrument of the Supreme Pilot here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>

<p>No more the desire-life, no more. The lure of yesterday’s desire-life has sunk into meaningless insignificance today. Aspiration, the real reality of the seeker in me, begins to triumph today. Aspiration, my heart’s inner cry, is hastening the arrival of my Beloved Supreme. From now on, I shall always remain devoted to my life within. From now on, my body shall sing and sing, my vital shall smile and smile, my mind shall fly and fly, my heart shall dive and dive, my soul shall spread and spread. No difficulty, no sorrow, no worry, no anxiety will be able to assail me. I shall not fall. I shall not stumble. Onward I shall march. Mine will be the life of the eternal journey, the journey that has neither beginning nor end. This is the ever-transcending journey, the journey that beckons humanity’s cry and Divinity’s Smile</p>
<p>The teeming troubles and tribulations of the past are no more. I am in front of an unhorizoned reality. Now, at every moment, unceasing opportunities are looming large. I shall avail myself of all these opportunities. From now on, my life of surrender to God’s Will will be my infallible guide. My life of devotion to my Beloved Supreme will be the supreme feast to satisfy my hunger of millennia.</p>
<p>My selfless love of God shall transform the dwarf-seeker in me into a spiritual giant. I shall become a devoted, faithful, soulful, unreserved and unconditional instrument of my Beloved Supreme. To manifest Him in His own Way my soul-bird flew down into the earth-arena. Now I have become one with my soul’s promise. My soul’s promise and my life of love, devotion and surrender will fulfil our Beloved Supreme throughout the length and breadth of the world. </p>

<p>Smile, my friends, my soulful friends, smile. Let us smile. True, this world of ours is full of suffering and excruciating pangs, but that is no reason why we should not smile. We must smile in order to unburden the world’s suffering-burden. We must smile in order to diminish its untold pangs.</p>
<p>Love, my friends, my soulful friends, love. Let us love. True, this world of ours is full of hatred and disbelief, but that is no reason why we should not love and why we should not believe. We must love and believe in order to empty the hatred-sea. We must love and believe in order to break asunder the cliffs and peaks of disbelief-mountain.</p>
<p>Claim, my friends, my soulful friends, claim. Let us claim. True, this world of ours has deceived us and betrayed us. Nevertheless, we must claim the world, for it is our bounden duty to change the face of the world. Unless and until we claim the world, we can never transform this world; therefore, we must claim this world as our own, very own, with a view to transforming it.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not forget to smile at our Beloved Supreme, to love our Beloved Supreme and to claim our Beloved Supreme, for He is our Eternity’s own, and we are His Eternity’s own.</p>
<p>We shall smile at our Beloved Supreme precisely because He is divinely great. We shall love our Beloved Supreme precisely because He is supremely good. We shall claim our Beloved Supreme precisely because we are His Eternity’s chosen instruments. Him to please in His own Way, Him to fulfil in His own Way—it is for this we all saw the light of day. He is our Source. In Him we see, in Him we feel, in Him we fulfil our journey’s course.</p>
<p>Smile, love and claim. This world of ours is undoubtedly a projection of our Beloved Supreme, although it is far from perfection. But there will come a time when we shall be able to radically transform the face of this world and turn it into Perfection-Reality.</p>
<p>Let us smile at God, love Him and claim Him, for He is all-where only for us, unconditionally for us.</p>

<p>I use my aspiration for success in the outer world and for progress in the inner world. When I succeed, the outer world smiles at me, appreciates me, adores me and extols me to the skies. When I progress soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally, my Beloved Supreme smiles at me, blesses me and embraces me.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is my self-giving.</p>
<p>What is self-giving? Self-giving is a supreme art. From this art I come to realise that I have to fathom my unknown realities and I have to know my higher self which abides deep in the inmost recesses of my heart. I have to become consciously and inseparably one with my higher self, which is in perfect tune with my Beloved Supreme constantly, and I have to manifest my yet-unmanifested realities.</p>
<p>My aspiration embodies concentration, meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>Concentration is my speed. With this speed I run fast, faster and fastest towards my Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Meditation is my depth, my silence-depth. With this silence-depth I invoke my sweet Lord Supreme and place Him deep inside my gratitude-heart.</p>
<p>Contemplation is my ecstasy. With this ecstasy I sing my oneness-song with my Eternity’s Father Supreme. With my contemplation-ecstasy I dance my satisfaction-dance with my Lord, who is my Eternity’s Friend and Companion. With my Lord the Father I sing. With my Lord the Friend I dance. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Spirituality</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Spirituality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Spirituality is man’s conscious longing for God. Spirituality tells us that God, who is unknowable today, will tomorrow become knowable and, the day after, will become totally known.</p>
<p>We must need God for God’s sake. God can fulfil us in our own way, but it is we who will not be truly fulfilled when God satisfies us in our own way. Our crying heart, our aspiring heart, our illumining heart, will never be satisfied unless and until it pleases God in God’s own Way; therefore, our God-realisation is for God’s sake. Man’s perfection lies in God-satisfaction.</p>
<p>A beginningless beginning tells us that spirituality is an aspiration-plant. This plant grows and grows; eternally it grows. An endless end tells us that spirituality is a surrender-tree. This tree bears divine fruits, and these fruits come to us on the strength of our constant, conscious and surrendered oneness with our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>True spirituality is our conscious acceptance of life, not the annulment, not the negation, not the annihilation of life. We must needs accept life and radically change the face of life into the very Image of our Beloved Supreme. Spirituality says to the heart, “O heart, why do you remain insecure? Do you not feel that inside you the Almighty, the Lord Supreme, abides? You must not feel insecure, for it is you who can proclaim to the world at large that inside you is the living Presence of the Beloved Supreme. Of all the parts of the being, you have been chosen to be the first and foremost instrument to guide the mind, the vital and the body to the soul. The soul eventually will bring them to me.”</p>
<p>Spirituality tells the mind to remain silent. It says to the mind, “O mind, do not think any more. Your thinking power is nothing short of confusion. You confuse the other members of your family — body, vital and heart — and, at the same time, you are yourself confused when you indulge in the thought-world.”</p>
<p>Spirituality says to the vital, “O vital, do not crave. Do not crave for name and fame. Do not crave for anything, for even if you possess the things that you crave, these possessions will not satisfy you. Even inside these possessions there will be a cry for more possessions. You will always act like a beggar if you crave for anything. No matter what you get, you will remain dissatisfied and unfulfilled. So do not walk along that path. Your craving must come to an end. Do not crave anything.”</p>
<p>Finally, spirituality says to the body, “O body, how long will you sleep? Do you not know that you have been sleeping from time immemorial? It is because of your ignorance-sleep that the rest of the members of your family are not able to reach the Golden Shore, the Destined Goal. O body, sleep not! The Goal is only for those who are awakened. Awake, arise! The rest of the members of your family will run faster than the fastest the moment you become active and dynamic and cast aside the shackles of ignorance-sleep.”</p>
<p>Spirituality tells the seeker not to live in the hoary past, not to live in the remote future, but to live in the immediacy of today, in the Eternal Now. This Eternal Now embodies man the aspiring seed and God the all-nourishing Fruit.</p>

<p>I need more. I need more peace. I need more joy. Peace I need in my mind. Joy I need in my heart.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more soulfulness. I need more selflessness. Soulfulness I need in my vital. Selflessness I need in my body.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more determination. I need more perfection. Determination I need in my aspiration. Perfection I need in my dedication.</p>
<p>I need more. I need more compassion. I need more co-operation. Compassion I need from my Beloved Supreme in my very existence-reality. Co-operation I need from humanity in all that I do, all that I say and all that I grow into.</p>
<p>When I have more peace in my mind, more joy in my heart, more soulfulness in my vital, more selflessness in my body, more determination in my aspiration, more perfection in my dedication, more compassion from God and more co-operation from humanity, at that time I shall become a most perfect instrument of God in the inner world and a most perfect representative of mankind in the outer world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Choice</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Choice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is our choice? Our inner and spiritual choice is Infinity’s perfection-poise. And what is Infinity’s perfection-poise? Infinity’s perfection-poise is our Immortality’s oneness-voice.</p>
<p>We choose God, not because He is great. We choose God because He is all Love. We choose man, not because he is always trying. We choose man because he is always crying. He is crying to unlearn all that he has learnt from his human, physical, earth-bound mind. We choose man because he is crying to assimilate what his aspiring and Heaven-free heart has taught him since it accepted the spiritual life, the life of inner discipline, the life of God-fulfilment on earth.</p>
<p>We choose Heaven, not because Heaven is all bliss. We choose Heaven because Heaven inspires us, encourages us and, finally, illumines us. We choose earth, not because earth is the battlefield of life where we can prove to be dauntless and adamantine soldiers. We choose earth because here on earth we can succeed and proceed, proceed and succeed. We can make constant progress, inner and outer, which is of paramount importance. It is here on earth that we can hear the message of liberation. Unless and until we are liberated from the meshes of ignorance, our conscious, complete and inseparable oneness with our Beloved Supreme will always remain a far cry. We choose earth because here on earth we can illumine the animal in us, transcend the human in us and fulfil the divine in us.</p>
<p>We choose ourselves not because we feel in the inmost recesses of our hearts that we have the capacity to lord it over the world, to conquer the length and breadth of the world, to become another Julius Caesar or Napoleon. We choose ourselves because we feel in the very depths of our hearts that our Lord Supreme has chosen us to manifest Himself in and through us. He has accepted us as His choice instruments to please Him and fulfil Him in His own Way. Him to please and Him to fulfil in His own Way is the only way to please the real in us and the Real in our Beloved Supreme. The real in us is our heart’s constantly ascending aspiration-cry. The Real in our Beloved Supreme is His constant descent with His all-compassionate Vision to illumine and perfect us so that we can become His perfect instruments.</p>
<p>The Lord Supreme manifested Himself in and through Sri Krishna, the Buddha and the Christ in a most significant way. It is His inner Promise to all the sincere seekers, here and elsewhere, to fulfil Himself in and through them in a most significant way. Sri Krishna’s choice was a sea of harmony. The Buddha’s choice was a sky of illumination. The Christ’s choice was a flood of compassion. And our choice is a heart of poise that can easily brave all the buffets of life. Poise within, poise without: this is our choice. </p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I pray</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="I pray" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I pray. I pray because I am hungry. I have an inner hunger for my Lord’s Compassion-Flood and Satisfaction-Sea.</p>
<p>My prayer is a two-way conversation between my heart’s soulful cry and my Lord’s blessingful Smile.</p>
<p>My prayer is at once my assurance and my confidence. I assure my body, my vital and my mind that they are of the Supreme and for the Supreme. I offer confidence to those who are sailing in the same boat and heading towards the selfsame Destined Goal as me, and yet are wanting in confidence.</p>
<p>Each day I renew my prayer. That means that each day I intensify and strengthen my commitment to my Beloved Supreme. It is my commitment, my sole commitment, to please Him in His own Way constantly, unreservedly and unconditionally.</p>
<p>I pray to my Lord Supreme that I will be conscious that His Existence is constantly with me. I pray to my Lord Supreme that I will be constantly, consciously with Him. I feel that when He is with me, I am partially perfect, but when I am with Him, I am totally perfect.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, out of His infinite Bounty, has already chosen me to be his devoted and surrendered instrument. Now it is I who have to choose Him as my Eternity’s only Pilot Supreme. It is I who have to make the supreme decision of choosing Him all the time on the strength of my inner cry. When I choose God unconditionally and when I remain with God constantly, at that time I am completely perfect.</p>
<p>My life is a combination of unanswered prayers and unoffered prayers. When my prayers are not fulfilled, I am not sad. At that time sorrow does not torture me, for I know that my unanswered prayers are blessings in disguise. It is my unoffered prayers that pain me constantly. My unoffered prayers take me far, farther, farthest from God’s Justice-Light and Compassion-Height, while my unanswered prayers are always helping me far beyond my imagination. The divine seeker and the divine lover in me teach my unconscious body, my uncontrolled vital and my unillumined mind that my unanswered prayers are blessings in disguise, for my Beloved Supreme knows what is best for me always.</p>
<p>My prayers are my Lord’s Compassion-cultivation and my own satisfaction-harvest. I pray, I pray. </p>

<p>We pray and we meditate.</p>
<p>We pray for our protection. We meditate on God’s Perfection.</p>
<p>We pray to become divinely great and supremely good. We meditate to realise who we eternally are.</p>
<p>We pray so that we can see the beauty and the divinity of the higher worlds. We meditate so that we can receive invitations from the inner worlds.</p>
<p>When we pray, our Father-Friend lovingly feeds us. When we meditate, we soulfully feed our Father-Friend.</p>
<p>When we pray, our pure hunger itself is our striking success. When we meditate, our sure satisfaction itself is our illumining progress.</p>
<p>Our soulful prayer makes us our Lord’s choice instruments. Our fruitful meditation makes us our Lord’s Vision-Voice.</p>
<p>Our heart’s prayer-cry serves the divine in us. Our life’s meditation-smile awakens and enlightens the human in us. </p>

<p>The desiring man tells me that human life is full of difficulties. The aspiring man tells me that human life is full of opportunities. The self-giving man tells me that human life is God’s constant Vision-Manifestation.</p>
<p>Each difficulty discourages and delays our success-life. Each opportunity encourages and expedites our progress-life. Each Vision-Manifestation of God helps us march faster towards our Destined Goal.</p>
<p>Life is love, love is oneness, oneness is perfection and perfection is satisfaction.</p>
<p>Human life fails; divine life succeeds.</p>
<p>Human love binds; divine love liberates.</p>
<p>Human oneness is a rope of sand; divine oneness is at once birthless and deathless.</p>
<p>Human perfection disappears in the twinkling of an eye; divine perfection constantly transcends its own heights.</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is the fulfilment of our desire-life; divine satisfaction is the fulfilment of ourselves in and through the fulfilment of our Beloved Supreme. Human satisfaction says, “My will must cover the length and breadth of the world.” Divine satisfaction says, “Let Thy Will be done.”</p>
<p>Human satisfaction is necessary as long as we care for the animal in us, the hungry wolf in us. Divine satisfaction is necessary only when we care for God for God’s sake.</p>
<p>We start our journey with the desire-life. The desire-life helps to free us from the world of sloth, inertia and ignorance. Then we come to the aspiration-life. The aspiration-life helps us to reach higher goals, higher ideals and higher realisations. The self-giving life constantly makes us feel that we are of the One and for the One. Him to please in His own Way is our sole choice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Liberation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Liberation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Liberation is the freedom from limitation and suffocation. Liberation is the transcendence of the body-consciousness. The body consciousness is the “I-ness” song, the song that says: “I have and I am.” Liberation is the embodiment of Eternity’s poise and Immortality’s voice. Eternity is God’s Silence-Vision. Immortality is God’s Sound-Manifestation. Poise is the God-Beauty in man. Voice is the man-duty for God</p>
<p>A liberated man is he who has smashed the shackles of birth and death. Birth is a painful cry. Death is a fruitless sigh. A liberated man is he who does not suffer from self-created ignorance. Ignorance is the unreal in us. The unreal is the source of all our teeming maladies. But our own birthless and deathless aspiration-ascent is the panacea for all these maladies.</p>
<p>Aspiration is Heaven-power. Heaven-power continuously sings and dances with enlightenment. Desire is earth-strength. Earth-strength is afraid of enlightenment. Enlightenment is not a boon. It is not even a gift. Enlightenment is a supremely fulfilling unfoldment from deep within.</p>
<p>Illumination, liberation and realisation. These three are inseparable friends. These are the rungs in our aspiration-ladder which reaches the highest Absolute. Illumination conquers darkness. Liberation conquers ignorance. Realisation transforms both darkness and ignorance so that we can become a perfect instrument which is used by the Absolute Supreme in His own Way.</p>

<p>Concentration is an art. Meditation is an art. Concentration is a challenging art. Meditation is an illumining art. Concentration reveals power. Meditation reveals peace. Concentration helps us expedite our spiritual journey. Meditation helps us reach our Ultimate Goal.</p>
<p>When we concentrate, we concentrate on the finite in the Infinite. We concentrate on a drop in the vast ocean. When we meditate, we meditate on the Infinite inside the finite. We meditate on the blue-vast sea inside the tiny drop. We concentrate to silence the world of outer noise. We meditate to hear the world of inner voice.</p>
<p>When we concentrate, we feel that the world around us offers us tremendous obstacles. Therefore, we are apt to reject the outer world. When we meditate, we accept everything. The world around us and the world within us both remain at our disposal. Only we transform all that has to be transformed in the outer world and in the inner world. It is in the process of transformation that we derive satisfaction.</p>
<p>Concentration carries the message of conquest. Right after conquest we get happiness. Meditation gives us happiness amidst the battles of life. It gives us happiness both in success and in failure, in victory and in defeat. The message of meditation carries us far beyond the domain of success and failure, victory and defeat. Meditation makes us feel that success is an experience and that failure is also an experience. These experiences ultimately lead us to the selfsame goal: satisfaction in our oneness-life with our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Concentration reminds us of God the Omnipotent. Meditation reminds us of God the Omnipresent. When we concentrate, Infinity in its power aspect appears before us. When we meditate, Eternity in its tranquillity aspect appears before us.</p>
<p>God created the world with His Meditation and in His Meditation. But in the process of involution, evolution, inner revolution and outer resolution, He uses concentration. God the Creator awakens us, inspires us and aspires in and through us with His Meditation-Light. God the Creation is around us and for us with His Concentration-Power.</p>
<p>Concentration tells us, “Run, run fast, faster, fastest in order to reach the Goal.” Meditation tells us, “The Goal is not in front of you. It is not remote from you. The Goal is within you. Dive deep within. To your wide surprise, you will not only see the Goal within you, but you will see yourself as the Ultimate Goal. You the seeker, you the aspiration and you the realisation are one and identical.”</p>
<p>We concentrate, we meditate.</p>
