<p>Today, for the first time, I allowed Kami to bite me. On other days, I move away when he wants to bite, but this time I said, “Bite me!”</p>
<p>Three times he playfully bit me so gently that it was nothing. Now he has started biting me regularly. He is not afraid!</p>

<p>When I was upstairs today, I heard a peculiar noise. Then I went down to the porch, and I was still hearing the noise. I said, “What is that?” It was really puzzling me.</p>
<p>Today I was hearing that same noise again, so I went down to the bird room to see if the noise was coming from there. When I entered into the bird room, I saw that one of the birds was saying, “Ahh! Ahh!” It was whining!</p>
<p>The bird is not actually suffering. It just whines.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Jealousy-world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Jealousy-world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If Sona sees Kanu with me, he becomes very jealous. He acts as if he were saying, “What right do you have to he with Kanu?”</p>
<p>Even if another person is holding Sona when I am holding Kanu, Sona barks and harks. Then, when he comes to me, he is satisfied.</p>
<p>But, generally speaking, when we got Kanu, Sona accepted his little brother right away. He has sincere affection for Kanu.</p>
<p>When human beings become jealous of someone, they do not maintain their real affection for that person. But dogs are not like that. My two dogs follow each other and play together. Even if Kanu bites Sona, Sona will only threaten him and growl. But he never bites Kanu.</p>

<p>Kanu used to cry at every second, either when he was downstairs or when he was upstairs with me in my bed. And sometimes he would fall off my bed and cry.</p>
<p>Cheese, medicine, food, water — no matter what I tried to give Kanu, always he gave me a hard time.</p>
<p>One of our disciple boys loves the two dogs so much. Kanu started crying this morning, and then that particular disciple also started crying.</p>

<p>As usual, Sona barked when the boys took prasad this morning. Then Sona went over to Kanu’s bed and lay down in it. Kanu was standing there. In silence, he was telling Sona to get out, but Sona did not listen to him.</p>
<p>I also was begging Sona to get out, but Sona would not go. I said to Kanu, “What can I do? I am begging him. Do I have to go and grab him?”</p>
<p>Kanu was waiting for Sona to go, but he would not. go. So, after some time, Kanu went to Sona’s bed.</p>

<p>For the last few days, I have been practising my cello in front of the middle door. I sit there because of these two great, divine dogs!</p>
<p>As soon as I come down from upstairs, they open their eyes and start crying. But if I sit in front of the middle door, they do not see me. So they do not cry.</p>
<p>It is all right with them if they hear the cello. As long as they do not see me, they do not cry.</p>

<p>Quite often when I sleep, Kanu has to sleep between my two knees. I could squash him, but he is not afraid.</p>
<p>Today, when I went upstairs, the first thing Kanu did was to lie down with his head on my feet. Then, after two or three minutes, he got permission to change position. So he lay down right on my head!</p>

<p>When I play the cello, one bird starts calling and calling, “Help! Help!” Even from upstairs, I can hear it.</p>
<p>Then the other bird starts screaming, “Carreras! Carreras!” I bought that bird in Venezuela. Carreras happened to be the leader of one political party.</p>

<p>He takes such a long time to eat one piece! I enjoy watching Sona’s performance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Kanu’s prayers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Kanu’s prayers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sometimes animals pray — just like human beings. At around six o’clock this morning, I was resting on my bed with my eyes open when my little dog, Kanu, jumped onto the bed and came right up to my face at eye level. Then he began breathing in and out practically with the same rhythm as I had in my breathing.</p>
<p>I did not know if my breath would ruin his breath, or if his breath would ruin mine, but I did not have the heart to move him away. I said, “This much love I have for my dog!”</p>
<p>When Kanu was breathing in and out with me, how devotedly and soulfully he was praying! He was not praying for anything in particular; he was not asking for a human incarnation like that famous cat in Brooklyn did once. Only he was looking at me with such a devoted feeling.</p>
<p>There are so many times during the day when I will grab him and try to get him to look at me, but he will not look. When he does not want to pray or meditate, no matter how hard I heg him, he will not do it. But this morning, he just started praying spontaneously.</p>

<p>So many times, Kanu will jump onto my chair when I am resting and come right up to my chest. Once, when I was talking a short rest on my bed in the afternoon, he jumped onto my chest. There was so much room on the bed, but he had to jump on my chest! That is Kanu’s favourite place.</p>
