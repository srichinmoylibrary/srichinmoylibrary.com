<p>God originated Himself from His own Silence.</p>
<p>God was One, but He wanted to become many. Why? He wanted to divinely enjoy Himself, to enjoy His Game, to enjoy the Truth in finite forms. He felt that if He remained all alone, there would be no joy, no <em>Lila</em>. If we want to play any game, we won’t enjoy ourselves alone: we need more players. If we want to play football or soccer, we need players to play on each side. Otherwise there cannot be any game. For His Game, God needed cosmic players. So He created Himself in millions of forms and shapes.</p>
<p>God is the tree and we are the leaves of the tree, God is the ocean and we are tiny drops of water. He is vast, but we have our constant oneness with God, just as the leaves can claim the tree as their very own and the drops can claim the ocean as their very own.</p>
<p>You can look at a leaf or any one of the branches and you can say. “This is the tree.” Or you can look at one of my fingers and immediately you can say, “This is your body,” because the finger cannot be separated from the body. Similarly, when you look at me you can say, “You are God,” because the one God is all-pervading. When you look at God in any of His many forms, it is the same God.</p>
<p>The purpose, the sole purpose of God’s creation is the fulfilment of His Vision and the fulfilment of His Reality. God has envisioned the Truth and the Reality, but He also wants to manifest it. Unless manifestation takes place, God feels that He will not be complete.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Why does God exist?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Why does God exist?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Why does God exist? Why do we exist? We exist and God exists on earth and everywhere for only one thing: Joy-to create Joy and to receive Joy. We sometimes use a deeper word, Delight, but right now let us use the term Joy. God is the Eternal Player. God creates something and, while He is creating, He gets Joy. When His creation is finished He also gets a kind of Joy. And then when He looks at His creation and sees the Joy that He has offered, He tries to receive this same Joy from the creation. He tries to get more Joy.</p>
<p>If a child is playing with a tennis ball, he will get joy first when he holds the ball, then when he throws the ball, next when the ball strikes against the wall and makes a sound and then when the ball bounces back to him. Similarly, when God creates something He offers His Joy outside Himself, beyond Himself. That which He spreads, He gets back, just as when a fisherman throws his net, it spreads out and he can draw it back toward himself again. So God exists because of His spontaneous inner Joy which he offers and which comes back to Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The source of life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The source of life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>People often wonder how God creates life from nothing. However, the word ‘nothing’ is incorrect here. God does make life out of something and that something is His Light, His Consciousness-Light. The Source of life is Consciousness-Light. Stone life, plant life, animal life, human life, divine life, universal life: everything comes from God’s Consciousness-Light. We all have consciousness, but unfortunately, ordinary unaspiring people are not aware of this. But the deeper we go and the more we become aware of the real consciousness within us, the clearer it becomes to us what life is and where its Source lies.</p>
<p>God creates life through His Will, through His Willpower. The moment God exercises His Willpower, His Vision is fulfilled. His adamantine Willpower can immediately perform any task.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God’s Dream and God’s Reality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God’s Dream and God’s Reality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God’s Dream-Boat is man: man the aspiration, man the experience, man the realisation, man the oneness, total oneness with God the Omniscient and Omnipotent, God the all-loving Father.</p>
<p>Man’s Life-Boat is God. Man’s life is God; man’s very existence is God. Man realises God, man embodies God and man finally will manifest God here on earth.</p>
<p>God’s Dream is man. His Dream is His Reality within and without and this Reality is also man. God fulfils Himself in man, with man, through man and for man. Unfortunately, the ordinary human beings are not aware of the truth that they have infinitely more divine and fruitful qualities than they can imagine. That is to say, they have infinitely more latent truth within than they are now capable of manifesting in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean when we say that man is a Dream of God? First, we have to know that God’s Dream is not like a human dream. There is a great difference between human dreams and God’s divine Dream. Earth’s dream is mental fantasy; God’s Dream divine is the precursor of Reality. Each second God’s Dreams are immediately being transformed into Reality. Human dreams are only pensive thoughts and ideas which we sometimes try to become. Very often when we dream, we feel miserable because our sweet dreams are never fulfilled. Sometimes we become victims of hostile forces which make us dream about all kinds of horrible incidents taking place in our life. Again, sometimes we create our own fantasies during the day and they come out at night in the form of a dream.</p>
<p>In God’s case He does not have these kinds of dreams. His Dream is more like a lid on a box. If you just lift the lid, there is the world, there is the Goal. So in God’s Drama, today’s Dream is tomorrow’s Reality. When you become one with God, you see that everything in God’s Dream already embodies the Reality itself. That is to say, when the Divine dreams in the seeker, then Reality is going to be manifested immediately in his life.</p>

<p>In our invocation to the Supreme there is a line that says, “Thou art one Truth, one Life, one Face.” “Thou art one Truth.” Truth is fulfilment. Only in Truth is there fulfilment; there cannot be fulfilment without Truth.</p>
<p>Then “one Life.” You think of Life as your life now, but you had Life before you were born and this Life will continue after your body’s death. Here on earth your life and death are just stages in your larger Life. So this is what we mean by “one Life.”</p>
<p>Last comes “one Face.” Face is manifestation. The Supreme manifests Himself in many ways and He reveals His Face through His many manifestations. There are two ways to see the Face of God. One way reveals His luminous features, His eyes, ears and nose. The other way reveals His luminous Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The finite and the infinite</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The finite and the infinite" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God is at once finite and infinite.</p>
<p>He is space. He is measured. He can be measured. He must needs be measured.</p>
<p>He is beyond space. He is measureless. He is boundless. He is infinite.</p>
<p>God is infinite Consciousness, infinite Bliss, yet he can also assume a finite form. He is infinite, He is finite; and at the same time He transcends both the infinite and the finite. He is life, He is death; yet again He is beyond both life and death. When I say ‘Supreme’, I am referring to the infinite, the Eternal and the immortal. But when I see Him, I see Him face to face the same way I see you. But in fact God is boundless and in the field of manifestation He takes all forms, from that of a tiny insect to that of a large elephant. Many people cannot agree with the idea that God can be finite. But let us think of one of God’s divine qualities called Omnipresence. According to our human feeling, when we think of Omnipresence we immediately think of vastness. True, He is as vast as the world, but because He is in everything, God can also be finite. Again, God is omnipotent. Where is His Omnipotence if He cannot become a small child, a tiny insect or an atom? At our sweet will we can do practically nothing. But just because God is omnipotent, He can do anything He wants to do at His sweet Will: He can be vast, He can be infinitesimal.</p>
<p>As human beings we are evolving towards our transcendental Perfection. We are aspiring towards the infinite. Right now, we feel that this is God’s creation, but that God has His own separate existence. But this feeling is wrong. Just as the soul is inside our body, God is inside His creation. Otherwise the creation cannot exist. When the soul leaves the body, we will die. Similarly, if God left the creation, the creation would also come to an end. God the infinite has entered into us, into these finite bodies, which last for fifty, sixty or seventy years. The Infinite gets the greatest joy only by making itself finite as well. We have to know, we have to feel and we have to realise this for ourselves; only then will we see God in His creation. Otherwise, we will think that God is in Heaven and, although we are His creation, we have no connection with Him.</p>
<p>Finite and Infinite, according to our outer understanding, are opposites of each other. But in God’s Eye they are one; one complements the other. The finite and the infinite always want to go together. The finite wants to reach the Absolute, the Highest, which is the Infinite. The Infinite wants to manifest itself in and through the finite. Then the game is complete. Otherwise, it will only be a one-sided game. There will be no true joy, no achievement, no fulfilment. In and through the finite, the Infinite is singing its song of unity. In and through the Infinite, the finite is singing its song of multiplicity.</p>
<p>God is everything, but each person has to feel for himself what God is for him. He can be infinite Light, infinite Consciousness, infinite Power, infinite Joy, infinite Bliss, infinite Compassion, infinite Energy. He can be personal, with form; again, he can be impersonal, without form, just as water has form when it is ice but no form when it is in the liquid state. At times we get joy when we see God with form; at times we get joy when we see God without form. We can see Him in His impersonal aspect as a vast expanse of Light. In his personal aspect He can appear as a luminous human being with two hands, two eyes and everything else that we have. He will be the most illumined Being here on earth and there in Heaven. When he appears as a personal Being, we can have all kinds of intimate talks with Him face to face.</p>

<p>The Supreme’s form is not always the same. He can change His form at any time He wants. Even spiritual Masters will not see the Supreme in the same way; for each Master, He may appear differently. If one starts his journey by thinking of God as a personal God with form, then he will realise Him as a personal God. If he starts his Yoga thinking of God as impersonal, then he will realise the impersonal aspect of God. It depends on how the seeker wants to approach God while he is in the process of aspiring. If someone starts practising Yoga while thinking of God’s infinite Consciousness, then he will realise God as infinite Consciousness. A spiritual Master may first realise one aspect of God, but when he has his full realisation he sees God in all His aspects.</p>
<p>No matter how God appears to us, we will feel ecstasy, divine ecstasy. Ecstasy is delight. When we are in our ordinary consciousness, we are disturbed by the many ugly, undivine things in the world. But when we see God, at that time everything appears beautiful to us. All is good and nothing appears ugly.</p>
<p>In our Indian scriptures we say, <em>Tat twam asi</em>, “That Thou art.” This is the realisation of the Vedic seers of the hoary past. But the most important thing is to feel that God is Something or Somebody who has not only the capacity but also the eagerness to fulfil us. So let us not try to define God. We can say only that God wants to fulfil us. Now we are trying to fulfil ourselves with desires, but we ourselves are not fulfilled even if our desires are fulfilled. Real fulfilment comes only when we are swimming in the sea of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The form and the formless</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The form and the formless" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When God created Himself, He created Himself in two aspects: the Infinite and the finite. When you think of the finite, you think of form, and when you think of the Infinite, you feel that there is no form. However, inside the finite is the message of the Infinite; in the finite is first the revelation and then the manifestation of the Infinite. The finite is necessary because it is through the finite that the Infinite plays its role in the cosmic rhythm here on earth. At the same time, the Infinite is necessary because it is in the Infinite that the finite has its eternal shelter. There it finds protection and perfection.</p>
<p>The Formless is necessary to realise the Highest, the Ultimate, the Infinite; and the form is necessary to reveal and manifest the Highest and the inmost in an intimate way. That which is infinite in consciousness can be seen only in the formless form. Again, it can house itself in form. That is why the heart can hold Infinity inside it. When you enter into the subtle physical, it is all formless when you enter into the physical, it is all form.</p>
<p>If you meditate in order to achieve some thing in a most tangible and intimate way, it is helpful to approach the Supreme in the form of the Mother, the Mother Divine. But if you want to experience something in abstract form, in the form of energy or ether, then you will approach an endless, formless form.</p>

<p>I see God as a luminous Being, the most luminous Being, who has infinite Love, Concern and Compassion for mankind. My disciples approach the Supreme as a personal God, as a human being. Although the Supreme has both personal and impersonal aspects, if you approach Him as a personal Being, especially in the beginning, your journey will be safer because the personal way is easier. If you want to see God’s impersonal aspect, you may become confused or afraid of the vastness. A human being may be only six feet tall, but inside him the soul has boundless capacity. Let us take the soul as the impersonal God and the body as the personal God in the beginning it is much easier for the seeker to identify with his body than with his soul if my soul wants to manifest its beauty or its strength through the physical, then the soul will give my body luminous beauty or solid strength. So the seeker can take the form as an expression or manifestation of the formless.</p>
<p>When the beginner meditates early in the morning, he should meditate on the Feet of the personal Supreme. Then, along with his own devoted love, he will feel God’s Compassion and Concern. He will say, “Here is someone who is really great, infinitely greater than I. That is why I am touching His Feet with such devotion.” He will feel that there is some purpose behind what he is doing. By touching the Feet of the Supreme, he is trying to become one with the Supreme. He feels that for him this is the easiest approach. If someone is very tall, I won’t be able to touch his head. But I can touch his feet. Whether I touch his feet or his head, I can say that I have touched him. But when I touch his feet, immediately I get the feeling of purest joy and devotion.</p>
<p>Then after touching the Feet of the personal God, we have to concentrate on the Heart of the personal God. Touching His Feet may give us a devotional feeling, but we have to ask ourselves, “Do I consider Him as my very own? Or is it just because He is very great that I am touching His Feet?” We can touch the feet of a very great spiritual Master: but along with our veneration, we have to claim that person as our very own. If we feel that he is our very own, then our devotion gets dynamic power: It enters into activity. When you feel that the Supreme as a personal God in human form is your very own and that you are His very own, only then can you have complete identification and inseparable oneness with Him. And from that oneness you get boundless joy.</p>
<p>When you feel that someone is your very own, you want to give that person something of yours. If you have a dollar, you want to give it to him: If you have a mango, you want to give it to him. But there has to be an exchange. He will give you what he has and you will give him what you have. How do you actually exchange? It is through Light transmitted through the eyes. When the Master and the disciple look at each other, at that time what does each one do? The Master looks at the disciple with soulful Compassion and the disciple looks at the Master with soulful adoration. The Master, who represents the personal Supreme, has all Compassion: and the seeker has all adoration. So they barter, they exchange. The Master gives his property and the disciple gives his property. Here they meet, they exchange their offering and then they become inseparably one.</p>
<p>The eye is the place of vision and light. Adoration is a form of light and compassion is also a form of light. Here in between the eyebrows, a little above, is the third eye. This is the place through which we shall give what we have to the personal God and the personal God will give us what He has. This form of meditation can be practised by any aspirant who is trying to go beyond his limited existence.</p>
<p>Again, it is best to start with faith in the personal God. In this way we get the feeling that we want to become like ‘Him’. He is very great but just because we take Him as a personal being we feel that we can become like Him. Next we feel, “Am I not supposed to give Him what I have and to take Him as my very own? Anything that I have, any limited quantity of peace, light and bliss, let me offer to Him in the form of adoration, because in everything He surpasses me. Although He has infinite Peace and I have only an iota of Peace, He is the Supreme. So let me give Him all that I have.”</p>

<p>Here we see that Father is the Face, Mother is the Smile. You need a face; otherwise, how will you smile? Again, if there is no smile in your face, then how are you going to make continuous progress, spiritual progress? They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. If you have one side of the coin, there has to be another side, or there is no coin at all. The Mother aspect with all Love and Compassion is trying to bring the child closer to the Supreme. And the Father aspect is also trying with all Wisdom and Light. But these are all complementary. Wisdom, Light, Compassion and Love: they always go together.</p>
<p>The Living Force or the Creativity of the Supreme is His Smile. Without this Smile, which is the very breath of the universal Consciousness as well as the Breath of the Supreme Himself, the creation remains unmanifested. In the very Smile of the Supreme is the birth of creation.</p>
<p>The Supreme is both masculine and feminine. It is very difficult to comprehend this with our human mind, for He is also beyond masculinity and feminity in His masculine form the Supreme is static and He always remains beyond manifestation. When the Supreme is unmanifested He is just a Face But if He wants to manifest Himself, then He has to smile. He is alive, He is functioning, He is active, but this we can know only when we see a Smile dawn on His Face.</p>
<p>When He comes into manifestation, it is through His feminine form. This feminine form in our Indian philosophy is called <em>Prakriti</em>, the Nature-Force or the Mother aspect of the Supreme. When the Nature-Force operates in the physical world, we see activity in the Being of the Supreme. And when Nature’s activity takes place, we see spontaneous Joy throughout the Supreme’s manifested form. This Joy expresses itself most effectively as a Smile on the Face of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Man and woman</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Man and woman" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God is both masculine and feminine. He is expressing Himself as female through nature, as <em>Prakriti</em>. He is fulfilling Himself as male through <em>Purusha</em>, the Unmanifest. We see God around us in His universal Form. If we go deep within, we see that this is His female aspect. If we go up to the Highest, the Absolute Infinite, there we see God as male. But we have to know that the universal aspect is in no way inferior to the transcendental aspect; both are of equal importance. God is enjoying Himself in His creation in the masculine and the feminine form. Both are absolutely necessary to fulfil the cosmic play.</p>
<p>In the case of man and woman, husband and wife, the male has to play the part of wisdom and inner peace and the female has to play the part of dedication and love. That does not mean that man will not have any love and dedication. No! But, in his case, these two divine qualities of wisdom and peace come first and then come love and dedication. Love and dedication are in no way inferior to wisdom and peace; they have to go together, they have to be combined. If he is sincere enough, man must feel that his entire success depends on woman’s conscious or unconscious inspiration, on her divine inner urge. If woman’s inspiration is conscious, then man’s success becomes quicker. But ‘female’ does not necessarily mean woman; ‘female’ is the feminine aspect of the Supreme. So man’s inspiration may not come from his wife. The female aspect of the cosmic enters into the male in the form of inspiration and makes him successful. If he is not successful in fulfilling the Divine or in realising the Divine, then he is no better than an animal. So his entire success depends upon the female. Similarly, woman has no existence without the masculine aspect of God; her life has no necessity or meaning. One complements the other like a complementary soul. Both are of paramount importance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Sons of God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Sons of God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sons of God have come at different times to perform God’s work, but they are all God’s children. We don’t have to differentiate between them. In this incarnation you have a name and in your previous incarnation you had another name. Even in this incarnation your mother calls you by one name, your husband or wife by some other name, your children by another and your friends by still another. You are the same person but people approach you in different ways. Similarly, although you play different roles in your various incarnations, your soul or spirit is always the same. Likewise the Christ’s spirit, Lord Buddha’s spirit, Sri Ramakrishna’s spirit, your spirit, my spirit, everybody’s spirit is the same, but the forms are different. God is the universal Spirit, but He is assuming different forms for the sake of manifestation.</p>
<p>Now you have to know that the one Spirit is all pervading but when it takes an individual form, when a soul enters into the world-play, it has to manifest its own inner divinity. The Christ manifested his inner divinity, Sri Ramakrishna manifested it, the other spiritual Masters manifested it. But still we have not manifested it. That is, we all embody God; but when spiritual Masters take the human form, they embody God in a special way. Sri Krishna was a great spiritual Master and in his case he not only embodied but also revealed and manifested God. In our case we have three things to do: realise God, reveal God and then manifest God. Sri Krishna, however had realised God before coming into the world, so he was already in a position to reveal and manifest God.</p>
<p>God and the spiritual Masters are one, and God and we are one. But the difference is that we don’t claim God as our very own because we know that we have done many things wrong. We feel that still we are in ignorance, wallowing in the pleasure of ignorance. The Christ said, “I and my Father are One.” But we don’t dare to say that God and we are one. Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha and the Christ, on the strength of their conscious realisation of God could say that they and God were one. All the Sons of God are divine manifestations of God the Absolute.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Belief in God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Belief in God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Some people say they don’t believe in the existence of God, the Supreme. But I wish to say that someone may not believe in God as infinite Consciousness or infinite Power, but he has to have some belief and some conviction of his own; and this is the same as believing in God. If a seeker is against the concept of God, if he is afraid or if he is doubtful, let him follow his own path. Let us take away the word ‘God’ from his dictionary. Let him have the feeling that there is no God. Let him go as far as possible in negating God. At the end of his negation, there he will see that positive Truth emerges. At the end of his journey Truth looms large and he can take this Truth as infinite Consciousness or boundless Energy.</p>
<p>God cannot be understood by any conception of the mind. If you go with your mind as far as you can, there will come a time when the mind becomes helpless. Then you will discover that you have to go deep within to find God. At that time God will come. Let us say that you are a teacher. If you show one of your children a particular city on the map called London, he may not believe it exists. You can even show him pictures of it and tell him it is in England, far away across the sea, but still he may not believe you. He has to take a plane to London and then he will believe that it does exist. Similarly, when a seeker comes to a spiritual person, he may come with doubt. At the very beginning, just like the young student, he may doubt the existence of God. But if someone has doubt or is afraid to enter into the spiritual life, I tell him not to worry; meditation is the answer. I will show him how to enter into meditation so that he may come and find God with me Just as the child has to travel to London in person before satisfying himself as to its existence, so a spiritual seeker has to meditate either with a teacher or on his own. Even spiritual books do not prove the existence of God. For the seeker, meditation is of primary importance; meditation is the only answer, Meditation will not fail him. Let him approach his true self and then see if he still believes that there is no God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The soundless Sound</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The soundless Sound" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before God created the Universe, He created Himself. God exists because of His creation; He created Himself. While creating Himself, He felt the necessity of creating two most intimate friends. He wanted them to go hand in hand with His own creation. His two most intimate friends were <em>Nad</em> and <em>Ananda</em>. <em>Nad</em> is Sound, the Cosmic Sound, the Soundless Sound. God created this sound, and He requested this intimate friend to stay within His Heart. Here in this world when you strike one thing against another, it produces a sound. But this particular sound, which is in the inmost recesses of our heart, needs no outer object or subject to produce it. Automatically, spontaneously, this sound is produced. That is why in Sanskrit it is also called <em>anahata</em>. <em>Ahata</em> means “struck” and <em>anahata</em> means “unstruck.” Then, along with this sound, God created another friend, <em>Ananda</em> or “Delight.” He asked Delight to be always around Him and within Him.</p>
