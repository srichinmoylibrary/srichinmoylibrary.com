  <h2 id="page-title">Silence is the answer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Silence is the answer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a very advanced, great seeker. Many people used to come to him for advice, but he would not advise anybody. He always used to say, "If you want to come and meditate with me in silence, I am more than willing to meditate with you. But I will not tell you anything."</p>
<p>People were satisfied with this. They were all gratitude to him for giving them the opportunity to meditate with him. Always they felt a kind of intense delight when they meditated with him, and tremendous inner joy used to envelop them. Sometimes during meditation he would smile at them most soulfully, but he would never talk to them.</p>
<p>One day a young man came to him and touched his feet, pleading with him for advice. "I am in trouble. I have all kinds of emotional problems. You have to save me."</p>
<p>The advanced seeker finally opened his mouth and said, "Look, my boy, why do I not talk? If I tell the truth, the world hates me. If I don't tell the truth, God does not love me. Now where do I stand? Truth is painful for humanity. I can't tell the truth or humanity will have ill will. And if I tell lies, I displease God. I want to please both man and God. So I remain silent.</p>
<p>"If I am deeply absorbed in silence, God is pleased with me. At the same time, humanity sees that I am not involved in anybody's affairs, either individually or collectively. To everyone I am the same. I pray for humanity inwardly, but if I were to become involved outwardly, I would have to open my mouth. And the truth humanity finds impossible to accept. Therefore, I remain silent to please both humanity and divinity. Silence is the answer to please the higher worlds and the lower worlds at the same time."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I like the compassionate God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I like the compassionate God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day a great seeker was praying and meditating at the foot of a tree. All of a sudden, without any rhyme or reason, a hooligan came and struck him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. In a few minutes' time, a friend of his happened to pass by. When he saw the seeker lying unconscious, he was simply shocked. Immediately he found a doctor, who brought the seeker back to his senses. They asked him who had struck him so badly, and he said, "He who struck me has cured me and is now nursing me."</p>
<p>His friend said, "Even at this hour you are cutting jokes! You were beaten mercilessly, you were unconscious. Why can't you tell the truth?"</p>
<p>But the seeker only said, "I know the person who struck me is the same one who cured me and is now nursing me."</p>
<p>In a few minutes' time, two policemen came dragging the hooligan in chains. They were positive that he was the one who had beaten the seeker. "This is the man. We are sure. You just confirm it," they said.</p>
<p>The seeker said, "What are you doing? Why are you torturing this poor man? The body is the temple of God. If you strike and smash the temple, how can God remain inside? Please, O policemen, let him go. I don't want God's temple to be tortured and destroyed by you. I will feel miserable if you do anything more to this temple.</p>
<p>"It was God who punished me through him and again it was God who cured me. It is also God who is crying through you for justice. But of all the Gods, I like best the compassionate God. Therefore, please let him go. I am happy in my forgiveness, so you be happy by becoming one with God's Will in me."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The boil-illumination</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The boil-illumination" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a great seeker who was on the verge of realisation. Every day this seeker used to pray and meditate with his friends. His friends were also his admirers and adorers, and they used to beg him to open up an ashram. As soon as he opened up an ashram, they said they would all become his disciples.</p>
<p>"Why can't you become my disciples now?" he would ask.</p>
<p>They would reply, "No, only if you open up an ashram will we become your disciples. If you have an ashram of your own and if we become members, then you will be responsible for the illumination of our lives. Now you are not taking us seriously. So please get an ashram, and we will become your disciples."</p>
<p>The seeker thought about this for some time, and he decided that it would be a nice idea: "Let me have an ashram and all the disciples will stay there."</p>
<p>O God, in the meantime the seeker developed a very painful boil on his right foot. The boil became very big and it gave him terrible pain. The doctor was called, and he got ready to operate. When he was about to begin, the seeker literally cried like a child. "Why is he acting like a child?" the doctor asked. "No, even a child behaves better than this. What will his friends and admirers think of him?"</p>
<p>The seeker's friends, who were gathered around, threatened the doctor: "If once more you insult our friend, we shall strike you. Pain is pain. Only the sufferer knows what the pain is actually like. If it is real pain, why should he not cry? So you remain silent and just do your job!"</p>
<p>With a mischievous smile on his face, the doctor began to operate. While the doctor was operating, the great seeker said to himself, "I could not take care of even one boil on my own body. I suffered so much because it was a foreign element. My friends are also separate human beings, separate from my life. When they enter into my life, it will be the same kind of situation. I don't have the capacity to save myself from one boil, so how will I be able to save their inner lives?"</p>
<p>"O God, I am so grateful to You. By giving me a boil, You have taught me a lesson. It is only You who can take responsibility for other people. One boil is enough to illumine me. I don't need illumination from human beings. Now I know that I will never open an ashram. I want only to pray and meditate and realise You. I will remain in supreme ecstasy, for I want only God-realisation. This boil is my illumination; my illumination is this boil."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The temple of love</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The temple of love" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>An old Muslim once went to a fair with his granddaughter. The granddaughter was so happy to be with her grandfather. At the fair she saw many things she liked, but there was one toy which she liked the most. It was a doll representing Krishna. She asked her grandfather to buy it for her, but he said, "I will buy anything else for you, but not this, because this doll is the God of the Hindus. You know how bad the Hindus are."</p>
<p>The owner of that particular shop happened to be a Hindu. He got furious: "Who asked you to buy a Hindu God? Go away from my shop!"</p>
<p>The old man said, "Who needs your toy? I am going." Both the shopkeeper and the old man exchanged a few nasty, foul words. But when the old man started to leave, his granddaughter began crying pitifully. She said, "I won't go home unless I get the doll." The grandfather was helpless, and he had to buy it for her. To the Hindu the old man said, "I am helpless. My love for my granddaughter far surpasses my love of my own religion and my hatred for your religion."</p>
<p>The little child returned home so delighted with her toy. Every day she used to play with the doll, even when she was walking to school. At home also she used to play with the doll most devotedly, and she never played with anybody else.</p>
<p>Some years passed and she became old enough to get married. When her parents told her that they would look for a husband, she said, "How is it that you say you will look for a husband, when all along I have been married to this doll? This doll is my husband."</p>
<p>The parents got the shock of their life, but what could they do? They said, "All right, you have shocked our religious beliefs. Now tell us what we can do for you."</p>
<p>The girl said, "Now build a temple in honour of your son-in-law. He is nobody other than Krishna himself."</p>
<p>As soon as she said "Krishna himself," the parents saw right in front of them the living presence of Krishna. They were so moved. Krishna said, "She is right. Build a temple so that people can come and worship me."</p>
<p>"Let us build it," the parents said. "But this is a Muslim community. No Muslim will come to a Hindu temple, and they will hate us if we build one."</p>
<p>The girl said, "No, if you don't listen to my Lord, my husband, then I am leaving you for good. I will never come back."</p>
<p>They were so attached to their daughter that they said, "Definitely we will do it. You are so beautiful, so spiritual. We can't lose you. We shall build a temple for your husband, the Hindu God Krishna." When they built the temple, to their wide surprise hundreds of Muslims began coming there to worship. The parents asked them, "Why do you come to a Hindu temple?" The devotees answered, "It is not a Hindu temple as such; it is a temple of pure divine love. When we come here, we are flooded with love. We feel its presence everywhere, and we get tremendous joy. But when we go to our mosques, we do not get the same joy. Instead, we get only an austere, rigid, lifeless and meaningless feeling. That is why we come to your temple. The Hindu God Krishna is all love, which we all need. What humanity needs is love and more love, nothing else; only love, love, love."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Oneness with the Will of God</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Oneness with the Will of God" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The founder of Sikhism, Nanak, was meditating one day with a group of disciples near a Hindu temple. When Nanak wanted to enter the temple along with his disciples, the guards would not allow him; they mistook him for a Muslim. He had a long beard, long hair and a long moustache, and his whole face seemed to be a Muslim face. His disciples told the attendants that he was not a Muslim but the great Master, Guru Nanak. But the guards were so ignorant that they had never heard of him and they refused to allow him to enter.</p>
<p>The disciples were very sad and mad, but they were helpless. They were afraid that if they did anything, the police would come and arrest them. So they left the temple and went to a nearby beach. Evening had set in, and Nanak asked them to meditate with him. They all meditated for some time, but the meditation was not deep, for they were still harbouring anger and humiliation. Nanak felt very sad. It was not because he had been prevented from entering into the temple, for he knew that ignorant people will always do that kind of thing. No, he was sad because he had become one with the sadness of his disciples. He said to them, "Look at the sky. See how beautiful and vast it is. Look at the moon, look at the stars. How beautiful they are! Let us be inwardly and outwardly as vast and beautiful as the sky, the moon and the stars." On other days the disciples would have all cheerfully become one with their Master, but on this day they were still mad, and they were not showing any kind of cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Nanak said, "In this world there will always be people who will insult us, but we should be above their insults. The attendants were not nice to us, but I tell you that the god of that temple is pleased with us. He will do something for us."</p>
<p>To their wide surprise, while Nanak was talking two large dishes full of fruits and Indian sweets appeared before them. They could not account for this, but Nanak said, "It was the presiding deity of that temple who brought this food. I saw him with my inner vision, but you did not see him."</p>
<p>But the disciples were not satisfied. They said, "No, it cannot be." They thought that one of the disciples had gone out and brought these things for them.</p>
<p>"Is this the kind of faith you have in me?" Nanak asked. On other days the disciples would have believed their Master. But today they were doubtful, because they felt that their Master should have shown his spiritual and occult power and entered into the temple. But Nanak did not do anything when the guards insulted him.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" Nanak asked. "Do you want me to show you another miracle? I have shown you so many miracles, but have any of them changed your life? No! Again, if you want one more miracle I can show you, but I tell you it will not change your nature. It will only increase your curiosity. But perhaps in this way you will be silenced. Go and taste the water of the sea."</p>
<p>Some of the disciples hesitated, others went. The water was full of salt. Nanak asked those who had drunk the water to come and sit before him, and those who hadn't drunk to sit elsewhere. Then he asked those near him to drink the sea water again. This time, when the disciples drank, the water was as sweet as honey.</p>
<p>"Really you have performed a miracle!" they cried. "Just two minutes ago it was all salty. We were about to vomit. But now it is all honey, so sweet."</p>
<p>So the people who drank were satisfied with this miracle, and both they and those who, out of fear, didn't drink the water, remained silent.</p>
<p>Nanak said, "I have pleased your curiosity, but I wanted something else from you: compassion-forgiveness, forgiveness-compassion and, the most important thing of all, oneness with the Will of God."</p>

<p>A great seeker named Bamadav was known throughout the land for his unparalleled kindness and compassion, not only toward humanity but toward all earthly creatures. Although he was extremely poor, his was the heart of magnanimity and generosity.</p>
<p>One day, Bamadav was preparing his simple evening meal. He had put butter on two pieces of bread, but had not yet buttered a third piece. He was about to eat the two buttered pieces when all of a sudden a dog started barking outside the door to his small cottage. When Bamadav opened the door, the dog ran in, grabbed the unbuttered piece of bread and ran away.</p>
<p>Bamadav ran after the dog, pleading with it to stop: "O dog, I am asking you to return my piece of bread only so that I can butter it and give it back to you. You are a guest, and guests should be treated with utmost affection and love."</p>
<p>As soon as Bamadav said this, the dog changed into a human being full of luminosity, and said to him, "I am the Supreme Deity. I came to you to see your oneness with my entire creation.</p>
<p>Bamadav was overwhelmed with joy and fell at the Supreme Deity's Feet. The Supreme Deity blessed the great seeker, saying, "You saw Me in a dog. Others would have beaten the dog, instead of begging to get the piece of bread back in order to butter it. Your oneness with the animal world, your oneness with all the worlds, your oneness with My entire creation — all have pleased Me beyond your imagination. Therefore, I am granting you the supreme realisation: Eternity's Peace, Infinity's Light and Immortality's Life."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Ramdas and the buffalo</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Ramdas and the buffalo" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day the great seeker Ramdas met the God-realised soul Tulsidas and prayed to him, "O great soul, do help me realise God. I have been praying and meditating for years and years, but still God-realisation is a far cry. Do help me realise God."</p>
<p>Tulsidas said, "I shall not only help you to realise God, but I shall make you see God tomorrow."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "Tomorrow? O great soul, perhaps you are cutting jokes with me. Am I fit for God-realisation?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are more than fit," answered Tulsidas. "Tomorrow, God will come to you. Keep your house clean, prepare nice, delicious food for God and pray and meditate the whole day most soulfully. God will definitely come to you."</p>
<p>The next day Ramdas brought many beautiful flowers to decorate his room and made a delicious meal for God. He remained soulful the whole day and prayed and meditated.</p>
<p>But O God, the whole day passed, and there was no sign of God. Ramdas was lamenting like anything. "Why has God not come? How could such a great soul like Tulsidas deceive me? But there is no sign of God."</p>
<p>All of a sudden Ramdas saw a buffalo standing near his door. He was so mad. "How could that buffalo come here? Where did it come from?" he said.</p>
<p>The buffalo entered into his house and began eating the food and destroying the flowers. The animal ate many of the fruits which Ramdas had kept so devotedly for God. Ramdas was so furious that he took a stick and started beating the buffalo. But the buffalo just kept eating to its heart's content and then ran away.</p>
<p>"Is this my fate?" cried Ramdas. "I wanted God and instead a buffalo has to come and ruin everything. O Tulsidas, is this your God? Tomorrow when I see you, I will give you a piece of my mind!"</p>
<p>The next day he went to Tulsidas, but the God-realised soul was in a very high mood. For some time Ramdas did not dare to speak. Then Tulsidas said, "So, God came to you?"</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "God came? A buffalo came!"</p>
<p>"A buffalo?" asked Tulsidas.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Ramdas. "It came and ruined everything."</p>
<p>"You fool!" Tulsidas said. "It was not a buffalo. It was God in the form of a buffalo. He wanted to examine you to see if you had established your oneness with his entire creation. If you had been in a very high consciousness, you would have seen and felt that it was not a buffalo but God Himself. God took the form of a buffalo and examined you. You have mistreated God so mercilessly that now it will take a very long time for you to realise God. So you may as well forget about God-realisation."</p>
<p>Ramdas cried and cried before Tulsidas, "How could I have known God would take the form of a buffalo and thus play a trick on me?"</p>
<p>Tulsidas said, "Pray more soulfully, more devotedly, more unconditionally and more unreservedly. Then you will know everything: where God is and who God truly is."</p>
<p>Ramdas said, "From now on, I shall try to be worthy of one day receiving God in God's own Way."</p>
