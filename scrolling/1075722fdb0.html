<p><em>(On reading Sarojini's appeal in the </em>Bande Mataram/ of August 18, 1908, for funds for the defence of Aurobindo, two patriots are walking to Sarojini's residence, at 6, College Square, Calcutta.)/</p>
<p>1st PATRIOT: We must not rest satisfied with our own contributions. However large the expenses, the country must meet them.</p>
<p>2nd PATRIOT: That is my feeling, too. We most work our hardest to collect funds from door to door.</p>
<p>1st PATRIOT: Yes, we must.</p>
<p>2nd PATRIOT: We have to plan an organised effort.</p>
<p><em>(Enter the two patriots and greet Sarojini)</em></p>
<p>PATRIOTS: We have brought in our humble mite. <em>(Each handing to Sarojini a hundred-rupee note)</em> We are planning a door-to-door collection.</p>
<p>SAROJINI: That's all to the good. So far I have received less than half the sum required. Sixty thousand, that's the estimate of legal experts. The amount so far received is twenty-three thousand.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a Punjabi postman)</em></p>
<p>POSTMAN: <em>(Handing a ten-rupee note to Sarojini)</em> Mataji, please accept this poor man's offer. Aurobindo Babu is our god. We pray for his victory.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a bearded muslim cabman)</em></p>
<p>CABMAN: Baji, [fn:8] Babuji has used my cab many, many times. I have received higher and higher Bakshis every time. I have wept and prayed to Allah for his release. Allah, Allah, help him out of the trouble! Kindly take this petty sum for his defence. <em>(Handing a five-rupee note to Sarojini, with a salaam he goes out.)</em></p>

<p>VASUDEVA: <em>(Coming in front of Aurobindo)</em> Look at me, my child. I am He whom you have been seeking. I come to tell you that from now and for ever you will be finding me in you, with you, around you everywhere. The second thing is that your work for India in Bengal is now done. I have decreed India's independence. The rest of the work for it will be done by others to come. I sent you on earth to do my work for world-liberation and world-transformation. That will require a very long and intensive preparation on your part. Henceforth, concentrate on it according to my guidance. As regards your case here, it is my concern. Leave it all to me. I will instruct your counsel, speak through him and see you released. You will remain ever free from all their blind efforts afterwards to force you out of the sphere of your work — for the moment in India, then the world over.</p>

<p><em>(C.P. Beachcroft, Additional Sessions Judge and Eardley Norton.)</em></p>
<p>BEACHCROFT: Mr. Norton, you know Arabindo Ghosh was a very brilliant scholar in England. He had no equal at St. Paul's. He won a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge. He was a contemporary of mine in the I.C.S. We both won honours at the University and, at the final examination of the Indian Civil Service, Arabindo the prisoner beat Beachcroft the Judge to second place in Greek and Latin. This is called the irony of Fate! Poor Arabindo!</p>
<p>NORTON: "To me it appears a matter for regret that a man of Arabindo's mental calibre should have been ejected from the Civil Service on the ground that he could not, or would not, ride a horse. Capacity such as his would have been a valuable asset to the State. Had room been found for him in the Educational Service of India I believe he would have gone far not merely in personal advancement but in welding more firmly the links which bind his countrymen to ours. The new era of reform, in spite of local and I believe temporary cleavage, illumines India's political sky and promises a future as much a matter of just pride to the Englishman as of hope and contentment and advance to the Indian."</p>

<p>SAROJINI: Sejda, oh that you were here to see how your countrymen, even of the lowest ranks, showed their heart's love for you by coming to me, singly or in groups, to make their offerings to your defence fund. Their love flowed in tears and in sacrifice of their day's earnings. The amounts were mostly poor, but immeasurably rich in their good will.</p>
<p>AUROBINDO: Saro, I was, no doubt, not here to see the touching sight. But I could somehow sense it from the impact of their love upon me. Look at the heaps of telegrams and letters on my release. I repeat to you the concluding lines of what I have written to the Editor of the <em>Bengalee</em>: "If it is the love of my country which led me into danger, it is also the love of my countrymen which has brought me safe through it."</p>
<p>SAROJINI: <em>(Taking the letter from her Sejda's hand and reading aloud)</em></p>
<p>"To the Editor of the 'Bengalee.'</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Will you kindly allow me to express through your columns my deep sense of gratitude to all who have helped me in my hour of trial? Of the innumerable friends known and unknown, who have contributed each his mite to swell my defence, it is impossible for me now even to learn the names, and I must ask them to accept this public expression of my feeling in place of private gratitude. Since my acquittal, many telegrams and letters have reached me and the love which my countrymen have heaped upon me in return for the little I have been able to do for them amply repays any apparent trouble or misfortune my public activity may have brought upon me. I attribute my escape to no human agency, but first of all to the protection of the Mother of us all who has never been absent from me but always held me in Her arms and shielded me from grief and disaster, and secondarily to the prayers of thousands, which have been going up to Her on my behalf ever since I was arrested. If it is the love of my country which led me into danger, it is also the love of my countrymen which has brought me safe through it.</p>

It was spoken first to myself in jail and I have to speak it to my people ... I walked under the branches of the tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his shade. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did duty for a door and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding and standing sentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were given me for a couch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my Friend and Lover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. I looked at the prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swindlers, and as I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found in these darkened souls and misused bodies ... Afterwards when the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many instructions for my Counsel as to what was false evidence against me and on what points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for my defence were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend me. He came unexpectedly — a friend of mine, but I did not know he was coming. You have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all other thoughts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day after day for months and broke his health to save me — Srijut Chittaranjan Das. When I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to write instructions. Then all was put away from me and I had the message from within, 'This is the man who will save you from the snares put around your feet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. I will instruct him.' From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my Counsel about the case ... I had left it to him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you know ... Always I listened to the voice within: 'I am guiding, therefore, fear not. Turn to your own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you come out, remember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I who am doing this, not you nor any other. Therefore, whatever clouds may come, whatever dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibilities, there is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation and its uprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall be, not what others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can stay.' ... I said, 'Give me Thy Adesh. I do not know what work to do or how to do it. Give me a message.' In the communion of Yoga two messages came. The first message said, 'I have given you a work and it is to help to uplift this nation. Before long the time will come when you will go out of jail for it is not my will that this time either you should be convicted or that you should pass the time, as others have to do, in suffering for their country. I have called you to work, and that is the Adesh for which you have asked. I give you the Adesh to go forth and do my work.' The second message came and it said, 'Something has been shown to you in this year of seclusion, something about which you had your doubts and it is the truth of the Hindu religion. It is this religion that I am raising up before the world, it is this that I have perfected and developed through the Rishis, saints and Avatars, and now it is going forth to do my work among the nations. I am raising up this nation to send forth my word. This is the Sanatan Dharma, this is the eternal religion which you did not really know before, but which I have now revealed to you ... When you go forth, speak to your nation always this word, that it is for Sanatan Dharma that they arise, it is for the world and not for themselves that they arise. I am giving them freedom for the service of the world. When therefore it is said that India shall rise, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall rise. When it is said that India shall be great, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall be great. When it is said that India shall expand and extend herself, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall expand and extend itself over the world. It is for the Dharma and by the Dharma that India exists' ... I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu Nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it it moves and with it it grows. When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines, and if the Sanatan Dharma were capable of perishing, with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish. The Sanatan Dharma, that is the Nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to you."</p>
<p><em>(Exit Aurobindo)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some members of the Dharma Rakshini Sabha speak to one another.)</em></p>
<p>1st MEMBER: I have attended big political meetings addressed by veteran leaders. But this meeting, could I or anybody else foresee it? A set subject had been placed before him to speak on with sufficient time given him to think over it. But you see, how he soared unexpectedly higher over it to another subject of far-reaching scope and of deep significance.</p>
<p>2nd MEMBER: Yes, he soared not only above the fixed subject but above the environment. He made us forget that we were at Uttarpara listening to one of our invited guests.</p>
<p>3rd MEMBER: He spoke not in a human voice and I doubt whether it was he who spoke.</p>
<p>CHIEF ORGANISER: I agree with each of you. I feel strongly that Uttarpara will go down in history as an obscure point on India's map from which the whole of India and then the whole of the world will listen to India's Godman, speaking to all humanity India's godman, speaking to all humanity. The cadence of his sentences raised waves of power in my heart. What power is this? It looks as if he will leave the political field. But I feel assured that what India will lose in him as a political leader she will gain infinitely in having him as a dynamic force to create a superior India and a superior world.</p>

<p><em>(Patriot Krishna Kumar Mitra's residence.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter a friend of Mrs. Mitra)</em></p>
<p>FRIEND: <em>(Addressing Mrs. Mitra)</em> Sister, a thought has just occurred to me and I have come to tell it to you.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: Yes, I am all ears.</p>
<p>FRIEND: Aurobindo Babu is in your house. The Intelligence Department knows it. Krishna-da is in detention in Agra Jail. The I.B.'s report, that you are harbouring the terror of the British Government in your own house, will spell disaster. Who knows that your house will not be a centre of the watch-dogs? For your friends and relatives to visit your house will certainly be to risk their safety. You can never want that your neighbours, friends and relatives should be the objects of the I.B.'s attentions. Harassment of innocents, I am sure, is the last thing you could think of. Over and above all this, there is the case of Krishna-da. If he is detained simply on suspicion, Aurobindo Babu's stay in your house will confirm it. All this will surely mean his indefinite detention.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: <em>(Smiling)</em> Now...</p>
<p>FRIEND: Now for your safety and for the safety of all else concerned as well as for an early release of Krishna-da I should like you to request Aurobindo Babu to remove to some other place apart from his relations.</p>
<p>MRS. MITRA: I appreciate your good will and your concern for our well-being. But, dear sister, to be on God's earth and at the same time to be in constant fear of danger to personal safety and personal interest, without believing in His Protection, is it not sacrilege? <em>(In a choking voice)</em> Auro is more than my Auro. He is Mother India's chosen child. If my friends and relations dare not visit my house, I shall be sorry for them. Mother India needs her children to be of sterner stuff. If they cannot rise to the occasion, I repeat, I shall be sorry for them. But I cannot do otherwise. My heart revolts against the very idea of seeing Auro off from his beloved uncle's house. And what would your Dada think of me? I know him, perhaps, more intimately than anybody else. His love of truth, his love of country are the same in substance and in spirit as his love for Auro. So, my sister ...</p>
<p>FRIEND: A true consort of a true leader. I feel ennobled by your lofty stand. I leave you and your darling Auro in the hands of Divine Providence in whom you have such flaming faith.</p>

<p>NIVEDITA: <em>(Raising her head)</em> Listen, Sudhira, and tell me who could write like this? <em>(She reads out)</em> "All great movements wait for their Godsent leader, the willing channel of His force, and only when he comes, move forward triumphantly to their fulfilment ... Our ideal of Swaraj involves no hatred of any other nation nor of the administration which is now established by law in this country. We find a bureaucratic administration, we wish to make it democratic; we find an alien government, we wish to make it indigenous; we find a foreign control, we wish to render it Indian. They lie who say that this aspiration necessitates hatred and violence. Our ideal of patriotism proceeds on the basis of love and brotherhood and it looks beyond the unity of the nation and envisages the ultimate unity of mankind ..."</p>
<p>SUDHIRA: Who but Mr. Ghosh?</p>
<p>NIVEDITA: Right. These words will pass into history and materialise in the life of India. Mr. Ghosh is not simply India's glory. He is the glory of God in the world.</p>
<p>SUDHIRA: It is a thousand pities that the Government should think of him as a menace to their existence.</p>
<p>NIVEDITA: Menace, no doubt, to a ruthless engine of repression that the Government are. I am, however, strongly persuaded that Mr. Ghosh's present letter to his countrymen will do the job. It is as clear as it is outspoken and well within legal bounds. Aurobindo is the Truth that is India. And the Truth will triumph.</p>
