<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the soul. One soul may take only one incarnation in a particular country, and one soul may take four or five incarnations in the same country. There is no hard and fast rule. It entirely depends on the Supreme’s Will.</p>
<p>The soul of each country has some inherent wish or urge to reveal and manifest God in a particular way. If it is an Indian soul, it may be through peace; an American soul, through power; an English soul, through nobility. So the soul of each country is different.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is to cure the illness before you meditate. But if it is impossible, then while you are meditating, please totally forget about the illness. For a few minutes while you are meditating, just consciously forget; keep the negative force away from your mind. At that time, the meditative power, the power of your meditation, will enter into the illness and it will be overcome. When the positive force comes from your meditation, then illness, or the negative force, can be conquered.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it is true that one can have a vision of God that is influenced by one’s tradition or culture. But again, it may not be so. When, on the strength of our own aspiration, we realise God, at that time it is up to God how He will appear before us. In some countries they have very fixed ideas, fixed notions that God will be like this or like that. The Indian gods and goddesses have all kinds of forms. Again, there are many Westerners who have not read Indian books at all, but they get the experiences of the Indian cosmic gods and goddesses. And at the same time, there are many Indians who have not studied your Bible and Scriptures, but they do see angels and all kinds of things. So if religious tradition has formed some mental concept of God, the seekers may see God in this way when they are realising the Truth. And in some cases, what they see may be entirely determined by God’s own Will operating in and through them. There is no hard and fast rule. It entirely depends on God’s Will.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between self-confidence and ego?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between self-confidence and ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ego wants to increase its power and lord it over others. Ego becomes powerful, more powerful, most powerful in order to dominate others. In ego there is no sense of oneness. But self-confidence is a different matter. It says, “I am God; therefore, I must be for God.” Self-confidence comes from an inner source, a higher source. We get confidence from there, from our inner existence, from our own inner reality. There is a divine root there. But ego does not have any root. Ego’s root is only ignorance. When we have the confidence to become good, we remember who we are: “I am God’s son. I came here to do work for God. I am not an unaspiring person. I am meant for spiritual life. I have to realise God, because that is what God wants.” But ego does not care for God-realisation. Ego only cares for separation. I, you, he, she — this is ego. Ego will give us the message of separativity; whereas self-confidence will say, “I am all-pervading. If I am all-pervading, if I and my Father are One, then it is beneath my dignity to mix with anything that separates me from another creation of God, another human being.” So self-confidence wants to become universal, whereas ego wants only to dominate others. Ego separates in order to show its existence; self-confidence shows its existence by becoming omnipresent, by becoming one with God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can learn the language of my inner silence by doing two things: by becoming more sincere in what you are doing and by becoming more dynamically peaceful in what you are doing. Peacefulness can be lethargic and it can be dynamic. If you become dynamic in your peaceful life, then you will know my inner consciousness, my inner silence. Peaceful life is inner silence. So increase your sincerity and increase your dynamic qualities inside your peaceful life. Then you are bound to learn, bound to know the language of my inner silence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Would you please tell us something about the transitional stages of concentration, meditation and contemplation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Would you please tell us something about the transitional stages of concentration, meditation and contemplation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Concentration is the focus of our attention on something very minute, finite, subtle, small. When we concentrate, we have to focus our attention on the tiniest thing possible. When we meditate, we have to meditate on the largest thing possible. From the tiniest, we develop the capacity to meditate on the largest. Martin, when you were a child, at that time, with greatest difficulty, you learned the letter ‘m,’ then ‘a,’ then ‘r,’ then ‘t,’ then ‘i’ and then ‘n.’ With each letter you had to struggle. Then there came a time when you could read ‘Martin.’ It takes all a child’s attention to learn the alphabet. But that same child eventually gets a Master’s degree and reads millions of books. So in the beginning, when you concentrate, you will learn the smallest thing and you will learn it perfectly. And then, when you meditate, at that time you will learn the largest thing, the vast ocean, the vast sky.</p>
<p>Then comes contemplation. Contemplation is a combination of concentration and meditation. You have the love for both the vast infinite and also for the tiniest. God has created the tiny ant and also He has created the elephant. If you really love God, then you have to love God’s ant-creation and also God’s elephant-creation. When you contemplate, at that time you love both the ant who is God and also the elephant who is God. Contemplation gives us the greatest joy because it makes us one. When you play the game of contemplation, this moment God says, “My child, now I am playing the role of the ant, so you take the role of the elephant.” The next moment God says, “Let us change our roles.” Then He becomes the elephant and you become the ant. Here, the Lover and the Beloved are constantly exchanging roles. At this moment, when the Lover is the ant, the Beloved becomes the elephant. Then it is reversed. But it is on the strength of love that this one becomes the divine Lover and that one becomes the Supreme Beloved. So, concentration is the little one, meditation is the big one, and then contemplation comes and unites the two together. Concentration and meditation must be unified in order to get the proper result of contemplation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Please explain how individuals become collective souls.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Please explain how individuals become collective souls." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a group of individuals pray and meditate together, they don’t become individual souls of separativity; but they become a collective soul, a oneness-soul. When ten persons have the same prayer, they grow into one reality. Suppose somebody is sick and ten persons are praying for his recovery. These ten human beings have the same goal: they become one soul. Ten souls become one not in the sense of ego, but in the sense of oneness. Collective soul here means oneness-soul, not the soul that enjoys separativity. It is through joint effort, conscious and constant effort, that the collective soul becomes oneness-soul. Now, how does an individual soul emerge from a collective soul? It is like ten persons who are working in order to support one family. They all lack good education, so they don’t have very good jobs. Each one is getting a very small salary; but when they combine the money, then they have enough to support the family. But then, out of ten persons, one person has some intellectual light. He gets a chance to go to school. Then he leaves the family. He goes out and becomes a man of knowledge and amasses material wealth. Then he tries to bring out another member of the family. Many of the Indian restaurant owners here are from a small town near Chittagong. They are poor people, very poor people, so they stay together in one family. Then one, with greatest difficulty, comes to London. Here he makes some money and then he brings somebody else here. In this way they keep their common goal to bring all to the highest standard. If you see this with your human eyes, you will say collectivity has gone away, because some members have come out of the family. But with the inner eye you will see that they still share the same goals. One has gained more light since he came to the West, so he wants to bring the others here so that they will also gain light.</p>
