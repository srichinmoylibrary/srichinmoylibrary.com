<p>Whenever I run alone, people talk to me. After God knows how many months, I went out to practise. Bipin and Pulin were following me in the car. After 1300 metres, a little boy came right in front of me in an intersection and said, "Please stop, stop, stop!" So immediately I stopped. Cars were coming on this side and that side, but they had a red light, so I could stop.</p>
<p>He said, "Have you seen my little white poodle? Have you seen my little white poodle?" It was so pathetic.</p>
<p>I said, "I have not seen it."</p>
<p>He said, "You have not seen it?"</p>
<p>Then he started looking for it again.</p>

<p>We had a marathon in Germany that was a perfect joke from the beginning to the end. it touched the height of absurdity. Our organisation reached the highest height. Fortunately, this was only a family gathering. The most important thing for the German disciples was their concert, so they paid all attention to that.</p>
<p>One reporter said I ran 26 miles. It was six, but he added 20 miles.</p>

<p>Today at 4:30 a.m., after many, many months, I went out to walk. I was enjoying myself like anything. After one mile I came back.</p>
<p>At my 800-metre mark a short but very fat lady was waiting for the bus. As soon as she saw me, she said, "Mr. Chinmoy, what are you doing at this hour?" Then she said, "Have a very nice day."</p>
<p>I said to her, "The same to you." She smiled.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" she was asking me. She could see that I was walking! I had never, never seen her before.</p>

<p>Then I went down the 150th Street hill. I saw a van that said something like, "C. S. Company." A young man with curly hair said, "Hello, Sri Chinmoy! Hello, Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Then I started to walk another mile. When I had walked about 1500 metres, I saw a cyclist coming. I went another 100 metres to complete my mile. Then I saw him stop. I said to myself, "Something is wrong with his bicycle."</p>
<p>He started saying, "Sri, Sri, Sri Chinmoy!" He was so happy to see me.</p>
<p>I smiled. Then, very slowly, he rode with me to Main Street, beaming with joy.He made a right turn and I made a turn towards my mile mark.</p>
<p>Both these young men were so thrilled to see me.</p>

<p>As I was walking in front of my house at 1:30, a young man came out of a car and said, "Run and become, become and run." He was not joking. He was showing tremendous admiration for me and sympathy with my pain. He was asking, "How did you get hurt?"</p>
<p>He said, "I tell my friends about you, and they don't believe that you live in that house. I tell them that the picture on the Santana and John McLaughlin album was taken right in front of your house. They don't believe me."</p>
<p>Then I came back and told Databir, who was in front of my house, to go and talk to him. The young man had said that he was a pianist, so Databir told him about Haridas.</p>
<p>Databir also told him about the Cologne concert. Then he asked Databir, "How can a famous person like Sri Chinmoy walk all by himself in a poor community?" He lives in Manhattan. He had a good conversation with Databir. Databir came to my house to get a book for him.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he got a call on his beeper, so he left to call his company. He said, "Tell him I will definitely come back."</p>

<p>At the 70-mile race, George Vallasi shook hands with me. He is so nice to us.</p>
<p>Then he said to me, "I will be right back," and he started running with his friend, whom he was helping. I thought that he meant he would run 100 or 200 metres, but he went on and on.</p>
<p>During the race I saw Nathan. I said, "Run! Run!" He didn't hear me. He just kept running.</p>

<p>Avery informs me every day about the six-day race in England.</p>
<p>One runner, an Englishman, was leading right from the beginning. At one point he said, "Now I am going to speak to Sri." Then he left the track and for five minutes he looked at my picture. He is not a disciple.</p>
<p>The person who is third also looks at my transcendental picture every time he comes near it.</p>
<p>One man tells Avery every day to say hello to me, and another runner was appreciating our races. Beverly Nolan and Bob Cannata were wearing our T-shirts right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Avery is helping all of the runners — not only Trishul. Our London disciples come every day also, to inspire the runners. If there is inspiration, there will be aspiration; and if there is aspiration, there is bound to be manifestation.</p>

<p>When I was watching the Olympic marathon trials on video, I was looking for Gary Fanelli, but I could not see him anywhere. They were showing only the lead runners — the first five or six. He ran 2:18 and his position was 23rd out of 160. The next time he comes to New York I will definitely honour him.</p>
<p>He is such a great runner! A few months ago he had an operation. He is not fully recovered. Only two months ago at our race in Connecticut he asked me to pray for him. He is very receptive; that is why my prayers work for him. He told me that he prays and meditates on my picture every day.</p>
<p>Once when he was sitting beside me at Madison Square Garden, he said, "Guru, to sit beside you is to sit beside the whole world."</p>
<p>His brother and also a friend of theirs join our races in San Francisco.</p>

<p>This morning I went out to walk fast. First I saw Nilima, then I saw Bhikshuni and then I saw Agamani — three!</p>
<p>After four and a half miles, three other girls — not disciples — were a little ahead of me on the sidewalk and would not allow me to cross the street. With greatest difficulty I crossed. Then I thanked them.</p>
<p>They started running behind me, saying things which I couldn't understand. For 100 or 150 metres they were harassing me. I turned around and looked at them, and then they all turned around and started running away. Then I went ahead.</p>
<p>In spite of seeing the boys following me in the car, they were harassing me.</p>

<p>In the afternoon also there was a car following me. Around my 700-metre mark a middle-aged man saw me. He said, "Sir, I do not know your name, but you are a very nice person. I have seen your picture in the train."</p>
<p>So I looked at him and thanked him.</p>
<p>Then I made a turn at 800 metres. Lavanya was running by. She thought it was the same story as in the morning — that the man was harassing me — so she came quite fast to my rescue. But the man was so nice — so happy to see me in the street.</p>
<p>Altogether, today I walked 13 miles.</p>
