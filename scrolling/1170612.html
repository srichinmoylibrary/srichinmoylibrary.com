  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one adequately express gratitude?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one adequately express gratitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not actually have to try to express gratitude. If you have true gratitude, it will express itself automatically. It will be visible in your eyes, around your being, in your aura. It is like the fragrance of a flower. True, there are some flowers that do not have any fragrance. But in most cases, if there is a beautiful flower, the fragrance will be there naturally. The flower and its fragrance cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Gratitude is the sweetest thing in a seeker's life — in all human life. If there is gratitude in your heart, then there will be tremendous sweetness in your eyes. When I see a disciple, I look at the beauty of his eyes. The beauty of the eyes is determined not by their shape or their colour. No, the beauty of the eyes depends on the heart's beauty. Inside the eyes I look for purity, gratitude and a few other things that come directly from the heart.</p>
<p>But of all the things that I look for, gratitude is the most important. If there is gratitude inside your heart, then it will be expressed through your eyes in the form of sweetness. When some eyes look at me, I see such sweetness in them — like the most delicious Indian sweets.</p>

Since Grace is not conditional, how does the Supreme decide whom to give the Grace to?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ordinary human life, everything is always conditional: if you give me something, then I will give you something. You have to give me ten dollars, and then I will give you one dollar. Or I will give you ten dollars if you give me one dollar. There are always conditions, conditions, conditions.</p>
<p>When the Supreme gives something, He gives unconditionally and does not expect anything in return. But if you are wise, you will also give Him what you have and what you are. If you do not give what you have and what you are, then you will not be able to receive from Him. The infinite ocean is always ready to give everything that it has and is to the drop, so that the drop can become one with it. But if the drop does not also give itself to the ocean, then how can it receive the ocean's infinity? The ocean is always ready for you to receive it. But if you are not willing to give the drop that you are to the ocean, then how can you become the ocean?</p>
<p>Sunlight is for everybody. But if I keep my doors and windows closed, then I will not be able to receive it. The Supreme is constantly showering each and every individual with His infinite Light, His infinite Peace and His infinite Bliss. But we are receiving these things only according to our love for the Supreme and our need for the Supreme.</p>
<p>Great spiritual Masters do so many things for mankind unconditionally. They go here and there giving talks and holding meditations, but how many people come to receive from them? I give peace concerts, I write poems, I paint and draw. Many, many things I do that I do not have to do. Sri Krishna said that after God-realisation you do not have to do anything else. None of these things that I do will increase my God-realisation. But I write, paint, give concerts and do all these other things only to inspire others.</p>

Is this also the case with the soul, or is the soul always receptive?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is always receptive. The soul is always eager to receive more light, more joy, more blessings and every divine quality. The mind and the vital very rarely receive. The heart from time to time receives, though not always. But the soul always receives. If the Master wants to give peace, if he wants to give love, if he wants to give light, if he wants to give bliss or any divine quality, the soul just grabs it. The soul is always eager and hungry for these things because the soul values them. If someone is a doctor, then he appreciates the value of medicine. But if you are not a doctor and if you do not feel that you are sick, then you are not interested in the subject of medicine.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you talk about compromise? Because of the stress of our way of life, sometimes I feel I need to vegetate, although I know that is not the best thing to do.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you talk about compromise? Because of the stress of our way of life, sometimes I feel I need to vegetate, although I know that is not the best thing to do." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is a most significant question. From the highest spiritual point of view, compromise is absolutely wrong. If I know the highest, if I know what is best for an individual, then I should not compromise.</p>
<p>When two countries compromise, it is a joke. It is out of fear that compromise comes. I have been fighting with you for many years but now, because I am weak, I say, "Let us not fight anymore!" But my heart is burning, and secretly I will work to make some new weapon or new strategy to conquer you. Then tomorrow, when I feel strong, I will again want to fight. The only reason I may not attack you is because I am afraid that you also have built some stronger weapons. So the peaceful compromise that we are reaching is based only on mutual fear, not on mutual wisdom. In our heart of hearts, we only want to remain peaceful for a few years or a few months so that we can prepare ourselves for some future battle.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, if you are dealing with the highest divinity in an individual, then compromise is out of the question. I have taken the full responsibility for my disciples' spiritual progress. Each time I make a compromise and let an individual do the wrong thing, I am delaying that person's progress. My goal is to take each one as fast as possible to the destined goal. If I allow somebody to delay his progress and do the wrong thing, then afterwards, when that person is in a divine consciousness, he will blame me. When he sees that Tom, Dick and Harry have gone much faster than he has, he will feel miserable. He will say, "O God, they were inferior runners. Now they have all gone ahead of me. Why did you allow me to compromise?"</p>
<p>It is like this: when you want to get up at five o'clock to meditate, the mind says, "Oh, it is too early." At six o'clock, seven o'clock, even eight o'clock, the mind says it is still too early. Then, when you finally get up at nine or ten o'clock, the mind says, "You fool, now it is too late to meditate! Who asked you to listen to me?"</p>
<p>Again, sometimes the disciples force me to compromise. I know that someone is doing the wrong thing, but out of compassion or for various other reasons I am obliged to allow it. Then I am the one who really suffers, because I have to put that person on my shoulders and carry him, since it is the Master's divine responsibility to make sure that each of his disciples runs the fastest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does a god or goddess feel when a human being has their name?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does a god or goddess feel when a human being has their name?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India, parents sometimes give their children spiritual names such as Lakshmi or Krishna in order to bring forward their divine qualities. They give these names with the idea that at every moment they will try to see inside their children the presence of these gods or goddesses. They are praying that the divine qualities that these gods and goddesses have will be manifested in and through their children. Some parents will pray for months and years for their children to have these divine qualities.</p>
<p>Again, some parents will not pray even for a second. They give the name not because they want their children to be spiritual, but because they get joy from saying their son's name is Rama or Krishna. They will give their children divine names, but they will teach them unthinkable things while they are growing up so that they can become successful in professions where the consciousness is not at all aspiring. They give their children the ideal names of some gods or goddesses, but then they lead their children into the jungle of deception rather than into the garden of divinity.</p>
<p>When I give a spiritual name to a disciple of mine, it is because I see the potentialities and inner capacities of the disciple. I see which qualities this person is likely to bring forward in this incarnation. Each person has many divine qualities, but some of these qualities are more likely or more ready than others to be manifested in this incarnation. So I give different names depending on the soul's capacity, willingness and eagerness to manifest the divine through some particular divine qualities.</p>
<p>When the gods and goddesses see that some seekers are manifesting the meaning of their spiritual names, they are very happy. But they become sad when they see that children who have been named after them are leading very undivine lives and desecrating their names. Some parents just give a spiritual name and then show their children the way to hell. In my case, I try to bring to the fore the divine qualities that the spiritual name embodies, and help the disciple consciously manifest those qualities.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I once had the opportunity to tell you about a very serious inner problem I was having, and you said that since I was able to reveal to you this problem, you could take it away. If someone does not have that outer opportunity, what is the best way to completely surrender a problem to you? Inwardly I had tried, but I was unsuccessful until I could offer it to you outwardly.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I once had the opportunity to tell you about a very serious inner problem I was having, and you said that since I was able to reveal to you this problem, you could take it away. If someone does not have that outer opportunity, what is the best way to completely surrender a problem to you? Inwardly I had tried, but I was unsuccessful until I could offer it to you outwardly." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This question breaks my heart. When someone has a secret inside his heart, do you think that his mind does not know? Do you think that his vital does not know? Do you think that his body does not know? If someone is suffering because he is holding a particular secret, his entire being is suffering. His vital is suffering, his mind is suffering, everything is suffering. Again, if someone is cherishing a sweet secret, a good secret, then his whole being is rejoicing. That is because his body, vital, mind and heart are one. This is the reason a good secret gives joy to our whole being and a bad secret creates problems for our whole being.</p>
<p>The moment you can share your secrets with the Master, you have already taken one step forward. Then the Master says, "Now I want you to go ten steps, a hundred steps ahead, and stop doing the thing that you are doing wrong." For two years or ten years or twelve years you may try to keep a problem hidden, let us say, inside you. Because you have kept your heart-door closed, there is all darkness, darkness, darkness inside. When you tell me your secret, it is like opening your heart-door and letting in fresh air and light. At that time I am so proud of you; you cannot imagine how much I appreciate and admire your sincerity.</p>
<p>But now that you have opened your heart just a little, why do you not open it the whole way? Many people confide their secrets to me; I hear millions of secrets. But they do not take the next step: obedience. They are ready to tell me that they have done something very bad. But when I give them advice and tell them, "Do not do that anymore," they are not willing to listen. And you have to know that it is not mere advice that I am giving. When I tell you not to do something, I am also giving you the strength not to do that thing. I am giving you the inner strength not to repeat your mistake. But you do not want to receive it.</p>
<p>Most of the disciples' problems start with disobedience and continue because of unwillingness. First you do something that you know your Master will not approve of. You break the divine rules and do something unspiritual because of worldly temptation or the desire for worldly name and fame or because you think you can make your life happier in some way. Then you do something else wrong by keeping it secret and not telling the Master. Disciples who have established their oneness with me or who want to establish their oneness with me will not be afraid to tell me their difficulties and problems. If they remain silent because they think I will be angry, then where is their love for me; where is their oneness with me?</p>
<p>When your sincerity finally comes forward to save you from your disobedience, you tell me your problems or why your consciousness has descended. But when I tell you what to do, at that time defiance or resistance comes and you do not listen to me. So what happens? Your sincerity is cut to pieces. When you do not listen to the Master, you are only betraying your own spirituality.</p>
<p>Some of my disciples are absolutely in their own world, and their world is millions and millions of miles away from the divine world. They have created hell for themselves, and they are enjoying it, so they try to fool and deceive me. When they finally come to realise that they are living in hell, they tell me that their secret is tormenting them and they are suffering like anything. I say to them, "Please, please, do not stay in hell. For years and years I have tried to create Heaven for you, but you did not want to remain there. Instead you wanted to live in hell. Now you want to become divine again, so I am giving you the capacity. In fact, I am the capacity for you." But these people do not listen, and both of us are the sufferers.</p>
<p>First you avoid the doctor; then finally you tell the doctor, "There is something wrong inside me." The doctor says, "It is cancer; take medicine." But you say, "No, I will not take medicine. I want to enjoy my way of life. I want to enjoy my cancer." But a spiritual Master is not like an outer doctor. If the patient dies because he does not take his medicine, the outer doctor simply says, "It is not my fault." But the inner doctor, the Master, is not like that. He suffers and cries because the disciple has not listened to him. When the disciple dies spiritually, the Master says, "If this person had followed my advice, I would have been able to save him."</p>
<p>The seekers and disciples who have been able to solve their vital and other inner problems have done so only because of their sincerity and their willingness to accept spiritual advice.</p>
<p>Inside your Master you can see the Supreme, the Highest. If the Highest cannot solve your problems, then who will be able to solve them for you? When the Master is in the physical, this is your golden opportunity to make the fastest progress. As Sri Ramakrishna said, the cow's milk is in the udder. If you want to get milk, you have to press the udder, not the ear or the tail. Similarly, if you want to solve your spiritual problems, you have to go to the right person.</p>
<p>Your Master is the right person to give you wisdom. If you have a problem, then you have the golden opportunity to go to the Master and have the problem solved. When the Master is on the physical plane, it is the easiest time for you to develop spiritually. The Master is the udder of the cow, which is the Universal Reality. Inside the house at one particular place is the shrine. At one particular place in the garden is the most beautiful rose.</p>
<p>If you can establish your oneness with the Master's will when he is on the physical plane, then you will be able to maintain it when the Master leaves the physical. But if you cannot establish your oneness with the Master here, do you think that you will be able to establish your oneness with him after he dies? It is infinitely more difficult! When I am on the physical plane, if people are disobeying me, are they going to do the right thing when I am on the soul's plane? You have to build your oneness-bridge here, right in front of me, if you want it to be there after I have gone to Heaven.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes disciples push and shove in order to be closer to you.

I know they do it because they want to get more light from you, but it seems like such an unspiritual way to behave." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you come to a Master, do not look around to see who is sitting beside the Master or who is the Master's closest. You came to the Master to be in the Master's Universal Consciousness, not to be in the world of competition. The competition-world will fail you, but the Master's oneness-world will save you. Those who establish their oneness with the Master's will and manifest the Supreme in their Master are the ones who will become supremely chosen instruments to offer the Master's light to mankind.</p>
<p>Sometimes a disciple inwardly tells the Master, "If you care for so and so, then I will punish you by leaving you. He is such a bad person that I do not want to be around him." Many people have left the spiritual life because they felt that their Master was giving more importance to people they considered bad than he was giving to them. In my case also, quite a few excellent seekers have left our path because they remained in the world of competition and tried to become close, closer, closest. But when they saw that they were not becoming close or closer or closest, they disappeared. Those people wanted me to please them in their own way. Inwardly they said, "I have done so much for you, but you do not care for me and do not think of me."</p>
<p>I always do what is best for the disciple's spiritual progress, and a true disciple will have faith in the Master. A true disciple does not care whether he is outwardly close or outwardly far away from the Master, so long as he can serve the Master in the Master's own way. Only those true disciples give me joy, because they are part of me and I am a part of them. They are the ones who really love me and really understand me, and their only goal is to manifest the Supreme in me on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Compassion-Eye acts like a magnet. It pulls into itself all the suffering, weaknesses, wrong-doings and other defects of human beings. It has an immediate magnetic pull. God's Compassion-Heart absorbs everything; it takes everything inside itself. His Compassion-Heart just grabs all the seeker's suffering and holds it inside. Fatherly affection we get from the third eye, but motherly affection we get from the heart. God's Compassion-Feet embody protection. There is not much practical difference between God's Compassion and Protection, because inside Protection there is tremendous Compassion.</p>
<p>God's Feet are always ready, again and again, to show their Compassion aspect, whereas God's Eye after some time will bring forward its Justice-Light. God's Compassion-Heart will show Compassion many more times than His Compassion-Eye, but far fewer times than His Compassion-Feet. If God's Eye shows Compassion ten times, His Heart will show it forty times; but His Feet can go on to one hundred or two hundred times.</p>
<p>Once somebody takes shelter at the Feet of God, no matter how many times that person does something wrong, God is ready to forgive him. The seeker is always protected at the Feet of God. No matter how many times he makes mistakes, God will say, "At least let him stay on the spiritual path."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you write poems in English, some of them are so beautiful and inspiring; they are like mantras. But why is it that when you make songs out of your poems, the Bengali songs are always much more beautiful and melodious?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you write poems in English, some of them are so beautiful and inspiring; they are like mantras. But why is it that when you make songs out of your poems, the Bengali songs are always much more beautiful and melodious?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not always! When I sing, <em>I came to Your Lotus-Feet with a hopeless hope-heart</em>, that song is as beautiful as any of my Bengali songs. There are also a few others. But you are absolutely right — in most cases there is no comparison between my Bengali songs and my English songs. Because of my Bengali incarnation, I find it easier to express some things in Bengali. The Bengali words come immediately from my heart, whereas the English words still come from my mind. In Bengali everything comes spontaneously, but when I use English, the mind is always there. Because English is a borrowed language for me, when I use English, sometimes a borrowed feeling comes. But the feelings I express in Bengali are never borrowed; they are my own.</p>
<p>I have learned the English language to my satisfaction. But when you want to give a borrowed thing to another individual, it does not come so spontaneously. Since I feel that it does not really come from me, I do not get the same joy in offering it. The English grammar can be correct, and the idea can be expressed properly, but an intimate feeling does not come for me.</p>
<p>I have written many, many mantras in English, and I know that they came from a very, very high source. But in singing, it is not a question of something coming from a high source. In singing, the feeling has to come from the very life-breath. That is why I will never be able to sing any song — even <em>Jiban debata</em> — as soulfully as I sing the Sri Aurobindo song. The way I can give my heart when I sing that song, I cannot do with any other song — especially not with any English song.</p>
<p>There are ten or twelve English songs that I can absolutely give my heart and soul to when I sing, whereas there are hundreds of Bengali songs that I can give my heart and soul to. When I sing certain Bengali songs, some of the subtle nerves in my being literally tremble, and I enjoy a kind of divine thrill. It is not excitement, but something very sweet, soft and delicate. I am filled with such bliss that my whole being is transported.</p>
<p>Again, there are times when I am singing some songs most soulfully, not because I am trying to sing soulfully, but because at that particular moment my throat chakra is completely open. The throat chakra is the spiritual centre for sweetness, tenderness and expressiveness in speaking and singing. There are times when I see it flooded with light — my soul's light. When the throat centre opens and functions very powerfully, at that time my voice is totally different. I even pronounce some words differently. But it is not my conscious will; it is all the doing of the throat centre.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some really advanced souls want to swim, but when they come to the shore they get frightened. They remember how much they suffered in their previous incarnations, and they do not want to jump into the water again, especially if they were people with big hearts who went through tremendous suffering and misunderstanding. These souls want to remain longer in Heaven, and Heaven is happy to have them.</p>
<p>The souls that were unaspiring and did not do anything significant in their previous incarnation are not wanted by Heaven. After six years the authorities say, "Get out, get out!" Then they have to go back, unless they are connected with some God-realised or highly advanced soul and get a recommendation from this soul to stay longer in whatever higher world they are in. Some souls may not be advanced, but because they have tremendous love and devotion for me, they get special Grace. Otherwise, ordinary souls cannot stay longer than just a few years in the higher worlds before coming back to earth.</p>

When we think of them, we immediately feel that they are in Heaven. But if we use our occult vision, we see that some of them have long ago taken another incarnation.

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When they come down, do these souls appreciate your outer activities?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When they come down, do these souls appreciate your outer activities?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am involved in all kinds of activities which puzzle some of these souls. They are hovering here and there and trying to get joy from my activities, apart from my spirituality. Thousands of souls who have not taken incarnation are getting inner joy and benefit from my art and poetry and other activities, whereas hardly any of the souls that have taken incarnation are benefiting outwardly from my activities.</p>
<p>If I look strongly into the human mind — and sometimes I see not only one mind but thousands of minds at once — I see that hardly a single mind is responding to my outer activities. The souls of these people are trying desperately to make the rest of the being respond, because the souls have chosen to have these kinds of minds. But the body, vital, mind and heart do not always listen to the soul.</p>
<p>A mother may give birth to several children, and each one eventually exercises its own freedom and independence. In exactly the same way the body, vital, mind and heart have an individuality. They are like a solid formation, and they can be very strong. When they are undeveloped, like little children, they listen to their parent, the soul. But when they grow a little older, they may not listen at all.</p>
<p>I can give you another example. Sometimes the manager of the office is so pleased with his new workers. But after a few years he sees that the workers are not listening to him at all. Similarly, in the beginning the soul may be so pleased that it got this particular body, vital and mind. Then, because of ignorance, temptation and other wrong forces, disobedience comes, and the soul becomes sad and miserable.</p>
<p>Some individuals, even though they have university degrees, try to ignore or discard the mind when they enter into the spiritual life. They want to remain only inside the heart in order to make the fastest progress. They do not care at all for the mind's illumination. Then, after fifteen or twenty years, they say, "Why did we give it up?" The same mind that they earlier put aside, they now want to consciously develop. So they start feeding the mind, and the soul suffers tremendously.</p>
<p>Before you entered into the spiritual life, for eighteen or twenty years you enjoyed freedom. That freedom did not make you happy, so you decided to try another kind of freedom. Instead of listening to your mind or your vital, you decided to listen to your heart and soul. If you feel that you are not listening to anybody, then you are only fooling yourself. Either you are listening to your soul or you are listening to your mind, vital and physical. To say, "I am the one who is making the decision," is absurd! You <em>are</em> your body, vital, mind, heart and soul, and your choices are made by one or more of these parts of your being. Only you may not be conscious of this because your meditation is not deep enough to see where your inner decisions are coming from.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we usually tell when a message comes from the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we usually tell when a message comes from the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You may think a message is coming from your heart, but the vital is right next to the heart. The spiritual heart is not in the middle of the chest but a little towards the right, whereas the vital is on the left side. It can be the dynamic vital; it can be the emotional vital. The vital is so deceptive. It hovers just near the heart and fools you. And when the vital approaches the mind, it gets nourishment there. The mind gives the vital most delicious encouragement-food because it wants to take the vital's help in defeating the heart. It will try to defeat the heart's divine impulses by hook or by crook.</p>
<p>The spiritual heart is fought by the mind and betrayed by the vital. Most people confuse the emotional vital with the aspiring heart, feeling that it is so luminous, so high, so sublime, so pure. But only spiritual Masters who have realised God can always recognise the real inner voice. Otherwise, the voice may come from one place but make you feel that it is coming from someplace else.</p>
<p>Again, very often what people take as the inner voice comes not from the vital but from the mind itself. The mind is speaking and the mind is also listening. And while listening, the mind is dragging along the body, vital and heart as well. I have had some disciples who believed they were getting inner messages when they meditated on my picture. They insisted that these messages, which came from my picture, were higher or more authentic than the messages I gave them directly in the physical, face to face. This is the stupidity of the human mind!</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo had a disciple who was on the verge of realisation. Like me, he came from Chittagong. Then he started getting inner messages. Sri Aurobindo personally said, "No, these are coming from your vital, from your mind. These are wrong forces." The disciple said, "Oh no, you have come to me in a most luminous form and told me to do such and such." Sri Aurobindo said, "If I am your Guru, then why are you not listening to me? Just listen to what I tell you in person, and do not look at my picture! If you have to make a choice between me and my picture, which will you choose? At least while I am on earth, listen to me." But the disciple said, "No, when I look at your picture, I get high experiences." Sri Aurobindo told him these were all mental hallucinations, but he did not listen. Instead of realising God, he was caught by the hostile forces which fooled his mind.</p>
<p>I am telling all of my disciples, if you consider yourselves my disciples, please listen to me and not to my picture if you are getting two different messages. The picture did not create me; I created the picture. If outwardly I tell you something, that is what you should believe. Listen to the messages that come out of my mouth, if they are different from any inner message that you feel you are getting from my picture.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely he was aware of them. But when he said, "I am the Way, the Goal," he was right. At that time he had become inseparably one with his Heavenly Father, the Supreme. Lord Krishna said something similar. He said, "No matter whom you worship, no matter whom you take as your Guru, all your love, devotion and surrender will come to me because I am the Ultimate." When you realise the Highest, you become inseparably one with the Highest. Once the drop becomes one with the ocean, you cannot separate them. It <em>is</em> the ocean; they are one.</p>
<p>At the end of your road, no matter what road you take, you are bound to see this. Now you are seeing me as a human being, so you say, "Oh, you are with us on earth. How can you also be in the ever-transcending Beyond?" But the Supreme in me can be at many places at once. Lord Krishna showed Arjuna his Universal Form. When the disciple sees the Master's Universal Form, at that time he will really know that what the Master has been saying is one hundred per cent true. When the disciple sees the Infinite, at that time it will be easier for him to see the finite. If you see that somebody has millions of dollars in Heaven, then it is easy for you to believe that he has one dollar on earth.</p>
