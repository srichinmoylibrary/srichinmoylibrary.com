<p>At one point, when some of you were singing running songs to encourage the runners, you were singing so slowly that it sounded like a funeral song. One man asked, "Is that our funeral dirge that is playing?"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "That is what I always say about my disciples' singing when they sing too slowly."</p>
<p>I felt sorry that I could not acknowledge you people when you were singing and encouraging me, but I was dying. Sometimes I couldn't even see your faces.</p>

<p>A husband and wife were running together for several miles. Then the wife got permission from the husband to go ahead. I ran with her for a mile and a half. Then I surrendered, and she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>When I went back to watch some of the disciples finish the marathon, I didn't see any of my running friends that I had met during my thirteen-mile training run.</p>

<p>I said, "Thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>I am also known for my monkeys. Three or four times I have heard school children talking about them. The children stand in the street and watch them on my porch.</p>

<p>Databir always loses so much time whenever he sees me during a race. He is usually so far ahead of me that he turns around to come back before I do. Then when he sees me coming from the other direction, he comes to talk to me and encourage me. In this way he loses precious minutes from his own marathon time.</p>

<p>Before the start of the Chico Marathon I was talking with Joe Henderson, the running author. When they called for the runners who were going to run thirteen miles, he ran to the starting line. He told our boys that he would come and greet me when I finished 26.2 miles.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The mayonnaise cup</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The mayonnaise cup" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At the one-mile point in the Chico Marathon I heard the time: 7:46. I said to myself, "It's too fast." Then it went on, went on. At every mile when I heard my time, I felt it was too fast.</p>
<p>I had told X and Y to give me water and ERG every second mile, but twice it happened that I didn't get it from them. At the two-mile mark the cup was very small. It was like the cups with mayonnaise or something that they give in restaurants. Instead of entering into my mouth, the water entered into my nose.</p>
<p>At the fourth mile X didn't come at all. Finally she came at four and a half miles to give me a tiny cup of water, but it didn't quench my thirst. At the fifth mile I began screaming that I was dying of thirst. Then they brought the thermos cup, which is bigger. So I was satisfied. From then on I was drinking like anything, but for the first five or six miles I was quite thirsty.</p>
<p>ERG powder I took many times. It helped, but the best was water. As soon as I drank water, I got energy. Before the race I didn't have to drink tea or coffee; water was enough.</p>

<p>Around six miles somebody far behind me shouted: "Guru, you are doing well, quite well."</p>
<p>Now, I had requested the disciples not to run this particular marathon since I was running, so I was wondering who this could be. Finally I saw that it was somebody who had "Reno" written on his T-shirt. His wife is our disciple, and he has been planning for the last three years to become a disciple. Still he is in the planning stage. He is a lawyer.</p>
<p>Another gentleman runner recognised me and said I was doing extremely well. He also called me "Guru."</p>

<p>Immediately I recognised him. It was the great runner Jay Helgerson, who ran a marathon every week for one year in 1979. He was on his last loop, but he stopped to chat with me. At first he didn't smile, but then he started smiling at me.</p>
