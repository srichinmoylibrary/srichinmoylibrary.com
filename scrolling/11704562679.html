<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thomas Jefferson never was and perhaps never will be appreciated in the way God wanted him to be appreciated because gratitude was not, is not and never will be born in this world. No other President, no other American, has done or perhaps will ever do so much for the progress of the American consciousness as Thomas Jefferson has done. Countries other than America that have developed inner vision will appreciate Jefferson much more than America.</p>
<p>People who bring new light into the world never, never get the appreciation, admiration, adoration and love that they deserve — never! I am speaking not only of Jefferson but also of Krishna, Buddha and the Christ. Did the world appreciate them, admire them and love them — not to the extent that they needed, since they did not need anybody's appreciation or admiration, but to the extent that they deserved? No, and this will never happen, because the kind of gratitude that is worthy of their light and their vision has not been born and never will be born on earth.</p>
<p>Jefferson's vision elevated the consciousness of the world in the twinkling of an eye. The light that he wanted to show his country and the light that he wanted his country to bring forward was so badly misunderstood! He never got the appreciation that he so rightly deserved and he will never get it, because humanity does not have that kind of gratitude.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you know that you are really giving from the soul and not just fooling yourself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you know that you are really giving from the soul and not just fooling yourself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you give from the soul, you will not look to see whether or not the other person is receiving and you will not expect gratitude or appreciation from the other person. If you give something from the soul, you feel spontaneous joy just from the giving itself. You do not feel that you are giving something away; you are giving your smile or something else just because you feel an inner, spontaneous urge. When you are giving in an ordinary way, sometimes the idea of charity or a kind of superior feeling comes to your mind. You feel that you are superior because you are the one who is giving. But in real self-giving, you do not see the other person as somebody else, but rather as an extension of your own self. In giving yourself you are actually multiplying yourself. You are going from one to two. With your heart's oneness you are creating another self that is exactly like you, and to that other self you are giving the same things that you have. With your own divinity, you are creating another divinity exactly like yourself — an exact prototype of your existence. It is like making another person in a factory. First you are making one person; then two, three, four, five persons; then countless persons.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you have problems with people in your daily dealings, how do you know when it is best to remain silent and when it is best to say something?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you have problems with people in your daily dealings, how do you know when it is best to remain silent and when it is best to say something?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is to pray and meditate most soulfully for ten minutes. Make your mind as silent as possible. Make your entire being so silent that if somebody dropped a tiny pin, immediately you would feel it. If you can make your mind absolutely quiet for five or ten minutes, then in your meditation you are bound to get the message whether outwardly you should advise that person or whether you should keep your proud mouth shut. The answer has to come.</p>
<p>If from within you get the message to speak, then you also need an additional prayer. You have to pray that you will keep your prayerful meditation-consciousness while you are giving the advice, for then your advice will be more effective. Again, you have to know that you may not be able to convince the other person. The other person may be so undivine that no matter how much inner wealth you offer him, even if your advice is coming from the very depths of your being, still he may not listen.</p>
<p>I do feel that I tell the right thing to my disciples, but very often they do not listen to me. Still, I know that I am right. In your case also, from the depths of your meditation if you get a message in the form of advice and someone does not listen, then do not blame yourself or doubt yourself. Do not feel, "Oh, perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps the message I got from within was not correct." No, the message was correct, but the other person is not accepting the light. If he does not listen, then after a few days or a few months, if you get the same message from within, you can try to tell him again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are teaching my philosophy in front of seekers, two things you have to do. Before you go to the class, meditate for at least fifteen minutes. There should be nobody around you — no colleagues, nobody. You have to feel that there is no one except you and my divinity. You are meditating on my divinity, which is also your divinity. My highest divinity and your highest divinity are the same.</p>
<p>Then, while you are speaking about my philosophy, you have to feel that I am speaking through you. And when you are looking at the students, you have to feel that they are really me. On the one hand, I am the talker, in and through you. On the other hand, I am the listener, in and through the audience. So, if you can feel that I am speaking through you and also listening to you, then you will get tremendous inner strength.</p>
<p>I am coming out of you and also I am entering into you. I am coming out of your heart and entering into the hearts of the seekers. Again, I am coming out of the seekers' hearts and entering into you. Feel that like a rainbow I am going from you to the seekers and coming from the seekers back to you. Or you can feel that you are taking me to the world at large, and again, the entire world you are bringing back into yourself. From the inner world you are carrying me to the outer world, and from there you are bringing me back again. If you can feel my presence in either one of these ways, you will be able to inspire your students and also you will be able to inspire yourself in a most tangible, productive way. Then you will be able to make the fastest progress and also the people who have come to listen to you will be able to make the fastest progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we think of happiness during our meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we think of happiness during our meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is fine if you want to meditate on happiness. But if you think of the pleasure-life during your meditation and call it happiness, then it is like misusing a knife. Instead of cutting a mango and sharing it with others, you are only stabbing yourself. During your intense meditation if you are getting pleasure from undivine thoughts or cherishing wrong forces or ideas, then you are only increasing their intensity. So, be careful. When wrong thoughts come during your meditation, if you cannot control them, then just stop meditating. Go and drink a glass of water or do something else.</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself what you want from the spiritual life. If you want happiness, spirituality is the answer. But this happiness will come only if you are prepared to make the Supreme happy in His own Way. No matter how many ways God pleases you, you will not be happy if in one particular way you are still displeasing God. God is ready to make you happy in your own way over and over again, in hundreds of ways. But your soul's love of God is such that if in even one way you fail to please Him, your soul will not be happy. And if your soul is not happy with your body, vital, mind and heart, you yourself can never be happy. Your soul wants to be extremely, extremely, extremely proud of you. If your body, vital and mind do the wrong things, your soul tries to discipline these unruly members of its family and inspire them.</p>
<p>You are in the spiritual life because you want happiness. If the spiritual life did not bring happiness, who would be such a fool as to practise spirituality? When you become in tune with God's living Breath, when you enter into God's Breath and become part and parcel of it, happiness becomes your inner and outer name and you get infinite ecstasy and infinite delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do I like crows so much?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do I like crows so much?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Russia they like crows; they feel that crows bring good luck. According to Indian tradition, the crow is very stupid. If a crow wants to hide a jewel, he keeps his eyes closed, thinking that if he does not see the jewel, then other birds will not be able to see it either. So much wisdom the crow has!</p>
<p>In Indian villages, it is said that when a crow flies overhead, it means that some calamity is about to take place in your life. Either somebody in your family is going die or some other unfortunate thing will occur.</p>
<p>When I was a young boy, there were many trees in front of our house. Two or three days before my father died, a crow would come to a very tall tree that stood by our house and cry pitifully, sometimes for ten or fifteen minutes at a time. In our case, it was quite obvious what calamity was about to take place. My father was so sick, and we all knew it was only a matter of days. So the crow was acting in accordance with Indian village tradition.</p>
<p>You can view this in two ways. One way is to take the crow as a bad omen and say to the crow, "Do you have to tell me that my father is dying?" Then you get mad and throw stones to make it fly away, but the crow only comes back. Another way is to feel that the crow is doing you a favour by warning you that something bad is about to take place. Then you can be more careful and alert. Now I feel it is a blessing if somebody tells me some calamity may take place, for I can pray and meditate and use my will-power to prevent it from happening. But in those days I did not have that attitude; I only surrendered to the unfortunate experience.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If crows are so bad, is it the ignorance in me that enjoys watching them so much?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If crows are so bad, is it the ignorance in me that enjoys watching them so much?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to call them bad? If somebody tells you that something bad is about to happen, then you can do something about it. In the Mahabharata, Narada warned Savitri that the man she wanted to marry, Satyavan, was supposed to live only for a year, but she still wanted to marry him. Then, during the whole year she was preparing herself by praying and praying.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people die unexpectedly in a plane crash or car accident, their dear ones feel sad because they did not have the opportunity to prepare themselves. Again, sometimes people feel sad when a dear one is lingering in the hospital for months and months in a coma. Outwardly they are showing sympathy and acting miserable, but inwardly they are saying, "For me to go to the hospital every day is so difficult! Why can my relative not die today!"</p>
<p>Anyway, you like crows. At one point you did have a crow incarnation, but from the crow incarnation you did not take human incarnation. The crow is there, but after the crow I am seeing something else. You could not be so faithful to the Supreme in me if you had not had a dog incarnation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What can you do? You have proved that you can bring victory to your Inner Pilot. How many people on earth would have succeeded in doing what you did? How many would have said to those undivine people, the way you did, "I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot." Out of 3,000 disciples, perhaps only five per cent would have survived if they had gone through what you went through. So did you not prove that you love the Supreme?</p>
<p>No matter how many times ignorance attacks you, your mantra is always, "I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot, I love my Inner Pilot."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ignorance is so bad! In some cases we do cherish ignorance; in other cases we do not, but somebody is making us feel that we are cherishing ignorance. A child may not like to eat a certain food, but the mother keeps on begging him to eat it or forces the food into the child's mouth, saying, "It is very tasty; it is good for you." Finally, the child becomes sick of hearing the mother and says, "Yes, it is very nice."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He does not get sick of anything. Since you joined the path, how many things you have done for manifestation! You are working twenty-four hours a day in Annam Brahma, plus you are giving me expressions so faithfully every day. I would have to come back into this world twenty more times to pay back my debt to you. But luckily, God has told me that I do not have to come back anymore, so that is my greatest consolation. In this incarnation, no matter how much I suffer, I can always be consoled by the thought that it is my last incarnation. It may be good or bad, but whatever it is, it is the last. Some spiritual Masters, during their last physical life on earth, withdraw very nicely; they do not enter into manifestation. It is too much for them. But that is not my way.</p>
<p>In a football game a player knows that whether he is winning or losing, at a certain point the game is going to come to an end. Then he is not going to play again. His whole body is so badly injured: his knee is fractured, his ankle is fractured, his shoulder is dislocated. He says, "I do not want to play anymore." But there may be a little greed in him, so he continues to play just a little bit longer. Every time I ran a marathon, I took an oath never, never to run another one. O God, how nicely I kept my promise!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What can I do to please the Supreme more?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What can I do to please the Supreme more?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to think of pleasing the Supreme more? Just think of the Supreme all the time, or whenever you can. Only sincere cheerfulness will help you. The Supreme is really pleased with you, but if you want Him to be more pleased, then when I see you at the tennis ground or at Annam Brahma, just express most sincere happiness. When you see me on the physical plane at Annam Brahma or somewhere else, sincere happiness should come from the very depths of your heart.</p>
<p>When you see me on the physical plane, you get joy. When you see me on the inner plane, you have to get the same joy. You think of the Supreme so many times during the day. Each time you think of the Supreme in me, pray to the Supreme in me or meditate on the Supreme in me, if you can get the same kind of inner joy and inner thrill as when you see me in the physical, then definitely you will expedite your inner journey and please the Supreme more.</p>
<p>Where were you brought up?</p>
<p><em>Akuli:</em> I was brought up in Indiana.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Many years ago, long before you were spiritually born, I was invited to give a talk at a Lion's Club or Rotary Club. Three different men wanted to introduce me. God alone knows who was supposed to introduce me, but the man who said he knew all about me pushed the others aside. When he was introducing me, instead of saying that I was born in Bengal, India, he said that I was born in Bengal, Indiana. Then they threw him out and somebody else came to introduce me.</p>
<p>Akuli, since you are so fond of crows, how many of them are in Queens?</p>
<p><em>Akuli:</em> I'm lucky if I see three a day, but maybe there are 3,000 in Queens.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Pulak, how many?</p>
<p><em>Pulak:</em> Maybe about 30,000.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Govinda, how many?</p>
<p><em>Govinda:</em> Twenty thousand.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Of you three, who can proudly justify his number? Who will dare to tell us that he or she is absolutely sure?</p>
<p><em>Akuli:</em> You have said that it's not how many mangoes there are in the grove, but how they taste. So it's not how many crows there are, but how much joy we get from them.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Chidananda is already getting joy. Without seeing the crows, he is getting joy, so he is more advanced than you are. You get joy only after you see a crow, but Chidananda does not have to see even one in order to get joy, so he is more advanced.</p>
<p>Akuli, do you know the silly Indian joke about how many crows there are? Somebody will say one figure, and somebody else will say another figure. One will challenge the other and say, "I know how many there are, but you count. However, if you get more than I said, that means that some of their relatives have come. And if you count fewer than the number I have said, that means some of them have gone to their relatives."</p>
<p>So if you say 3,000 and it is more, that means that some of the relatives of the crows in Queens have come. But if there are fewer than 3,000, that means that some crows from Queens have gone to the Bronx to visit their relatives.</p>

<h2>Question: I am such a bad singer and know so little about music. I was wondering if I ever had any musical incarnation.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Earthly music you have not studied. But there is something called Heavenly music, and that you have studied. You may not be able to appreciate the subtleties or ethereal qualities of earthly music; you may not be able to carry a tune. But your soul will be able to make your heart aware of very, very subtle and very, very delicate things in music, and your heart will be able to appreciate them.</p>
<p>Many great musicians in the West cannot appreciate subtle music when it is played. There are many, many excellent singers and excellent musicians, I tell you, who get nothing when they hear very subtle music. You can say it is because of insecurity or because of jealousy, or you can blame it on some wrong forces that have entered into them. But they lack the receptivity to appreciate the subtle feeling in the music. Then, by failing to appreciate, after a while they lose the faculty of appreciating. In your case, however, you are not identifying with the person or even with what he is playing, so you are able to receive more from the music than others can.</p>
<p>You do not know anything about music; you are not a musician or a singer. But when subtle music is played, your heart will appreciate it so much. At that time your appreciation is going not just to the person who is playing or singing, but directly to the Source — to the One who has given that particular individual the capacity to sing most soulfully or to play most soulfully or powerfully. So you are getting Blessings from God the Supreme Singer and God the Supreme Musician.</p>
<p>Outwardly nobody can understand music. Music is not something to understand. It is all a matter of feeling. There are many people, especially in the West, who have become good singers and good musicians mechanically — by training and training in a very disciplined, mechanical way. When these great musicians want to play or when they want to sing, they can do it very well. Their music may sound beautiful and soulful, but there is such a thing as counterfeit soulfulness. Their hands are moving and people are saying, "How soulful!" But it is because mechanically they have learned how to play soulfully. They have trained their mind or they have achieved a certain level of expertise that enables them to do it. But inside their music there is no soul, no feeling, nothing! They are playing so beautifully, but they are thinking of such rubbish, such mundane things — absolutely nothing spiritual. And in the inner world they are only quarrelling and fighting. Very often the listener, if he is in a soulful consciousness, is getting much more benefit from the music than the performer, for the performer is not embodying the soulfulness that he is expressing.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can reveal something without embodying it. For example, you may be telling the absolute truth, but your consciousness is not there. You have separated your consciousness from the truth itself. So while you are expressing the truth, you are not embodying the truth-consciousness. Only mechanically you are telling something that is correct. Because your expression is mechanical, you are not getting real blessings from the higher forces that are revealing the truth to you; you are not getting Blessings from God the Truth.</p>
<p>So, in your case and in the case of a few others who also are not singers or musicians, you are able to get something very high from music. When a singer or a musician does something very subtle, very soulful, silently you are appreciating it. You do not know which raga he is playing or whether he is playing Mozart, Bach, Chopin or Beethoven. You know nothing about the musical structure and you do not have to know. But your heart is going up because it is feeling something so soulful and powerful, whereas others who know all about music may be getting nothing because they have lost the ability to appreciate subtle music. And you are also getting more benefit than the performer, who may not be embodying the consciousness that he is revealing.</p>
<p>Again, there are some who know music very well and also have the ability to appreciate the very subtle, delicate aspects of music. They have the eagerness to dive deep within and continually learn. Some musicians, once they have learned something, do not want to learn anything more. They are afraid that if they learn more, people will think that they are borrowing or copying from somebody. So they are satisfied with what they already have. But someone who truly loves music and who is really great in music will never be satisfied with what he has. In the highest music world, our aspiration is constantly going up and our soulful and divine capacities are constantly increasing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Self-sufficiency or God-sufficiency</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Self-sufficiency or God-sufficiency" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I have read your marathon letter. I am such a "great man"! Usually when I get a marathon letter, I do not read the whole thing. I read the first line and then I use my occult power to know what the rest says. But in your case I have read each and every line.</p>
<p>You have made it very clear to me that you want to be self-sufficient. Unfortunately, good girl, I have a different philosophy. In my philosophy I only want to be God's Compassion-sufficient. That is my prayer to God. People who try to be self-sufficient in the financial field, the spiritual field or any other field will never be happy. People who try to be self-sufficient on the physical, vital or psychic plane, or on any other plane, are bound to be miserable.</p>
<p>Ordinary people want to be self-sufficient by having more money or by having more houses. They think that the more material wealth they have, the more self-sufficient they will be. But when they have more money, they start doing all kinds of bad things. And if they have four houses, they will see that these houses are only creating more problems for them. Even on the spiritual plane, if someone wants to have more spiritual wealth — occult power and all those kinds of things — he will only create headaches for himself. So if you try to become self-sufficient, not only on the earthly plane but even on the Heavenly plane, you will end up miserable.</p>
<p>But if, through your prayers, your meditations, your selfless service, your gratitude and your surrender to God's Will, you try to become more worthy of God's Compassion, then at every moment you will be happy. You will get the inner assurance from God Himself that He will make you happy — not only today, but also tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>A disciple's letter can be private, but the answer that I am giving applies to all of you. Your mind is telling you, "If I do this and become self-sufficient, then I will be secure; I will be happy." But this is not true. You can become secure and happy only if you become more receptive to God's Compassion. If you pray to God, "Make me worthy of Your Compassion; make me worthy of Your Love," then one day you will be able to receive God's real Love, real Light, real Compassion and everything else that God wants to offer you.</p>
<p>So, to all my disciples I am saying this: If you think your security depends on your own self-sufficiency, then you are sadly mistaken. No human being on earth can become really secure by becoming self-sufficient. This applies not only to spiritual people, but to everybody. It is your mind that tells you that if you get a Master's degree or a Ph.D., then you will become secure. But while you are studying, so many bad forces will attack you. Then where is your security? Where is your happiness? But if you become God's Compassion-sufficient, if you become worthy of God's Compassion, then God will guide you at every moment. At that time God's own Light will be your security.</p>
<p>You are projecting the future with your mind and saying, "If I become this, then I will get that." But you may not get it, or there may be something else that will sidetrack you and push you away from your goal. You may think, "Perhaps this is not the right thing, so let me do something else," and you will become unhappy again. Again, even if you do what you wanted to do and become what you wanted to become, still you will not be happy, because these things will not bring you the security and happiness that you expected.</p>
<p>So, good girl, if you want to be happy and secure, just try to be more receptive and more worthy of the Supreme's Compassion. Try to accept God's Compassion in God's own Way. Inside God's Compassion is infinite Peace, infinite Light, infinite Love. Your whole letter I have read and understood, and your whole letter I have answered. When you are saying that if you do this and that, then you will not have to worry about your finances and your future — all this I have understood. But you are making a mountain out of a molehill — a mountain that will only collapse. On the other hand, if you follow the divine way, if you allow Somebody else and Something else — God and God's Compassion — to work in and through you, then you will see God's Light operating everywhere in your life. And that Light is the only happiness and security.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does my mind have any special message for me?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does my mind have any special message for me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind goes through three main stages. First is the sleeping stage, when the mind is fast asleep. Then comes the stage when the mind is awakened, and finally there is the stage when the mind becomes illumined. Again, there are many levels within each stage, but these are the three main categories.</p>
<p>Definitely your mind is not asleep anymore. You are not in ignorance-sleep. Your mind is between the awakened stage and the illumined stage. When you are in the illumined mind, when your soul's light is powerfully working in your heart and inside your mind, at that time you are saying the right thing to the right person and doing the right thing for the right person. You are telling the right person to do the right thing, but the wrong person you are not telling this. It is not because the wrong person is your enemy or because it is beneath your dignity to tell him. No, only the wrong person's hour has not struck, and if you tell him to do what for somebody else is absolutely the right thing, it will only expedite the other person's destruction.</p>
<p>Again, when you are just in the awakened mind, at that time you show kindness and sympathy to people who not only do not deserve it but also misuse what you are offering to them. You will say that once you are kind to them, your task is over. But you have to know that your kindness can be used in a very wrong way. If somebody comes to you and asks for a dollar, because you have a big heart you will give him the dollar. But you have no idea whether the person is good or bad, or what he plans to do with the money. Perhaps he will use it to take a subway or taxi to a church, where he will pray and meditate and try to become a better person. That is very good. Again, perhaps the person will go to a bar and drink and lower his consciousness. Then who is the culprit? You are so happy that you have shown your generosity and charity, but you have actually made a mistake.</p>
<p>You may try to escape by saying, "I did not know." But an unconscious mistake is still a mistake, and it can produce bad results. Even if unconsciously I touch fire, I will still burn my hand. Similarly, unconsciously you have helped someone become worse than he otherwise might have been. If you had not helped that person, at least for a short while he would have been a slightly better person.</p>
<p>In your case I will give you an example of what is happening. You are showing compassion to people who are misusing it and thus heading towards even greater destruction. When some people give up their spiritual life, you feel sad and miserable. You feel that perhaps if you had <em>not</em> said this or if you <em>had</em> said that, they would not have left the spiritual path — as though you are responsible for their leaving. God cannot save that person from destruction, the Master cannot save that person; but you think that perhaps if you had done something or said something, in some way you could have prevented or delayed that individual's departure. That is a real mistake. I am saying "you," but this applies to many people.</p>
<p>It is far better to remain in the awakened mind than in the mire of ignorance-sleep. But the awakened mind may not always have the necessary wisdom to do the right thing. You are awakened to the point where you want to be kind and nice to people. I am not asking you to be indifferent to people — far from it! But kindness has to be accompanied by inner light. If kindness does not carry inner light, then it can be misused very badly.</p>
<p>The awakened mind believes in charity, patience, compassion and so on. Because it is awakened, it feels a vast consciousness entering into it. It is like what happens when somebody's flower-heart blossoms; at that time the heart becomes big. So the awakened mind immediately looks to this side and that side and tries to do the right thing. Unfortunately, it does not always know what the right thing is or how to use its expanded consciousness correctly.</p>
<p>So it is always good to use the mind that has got direct light from the soul, which comes through the heart. That is the mind that will save you. If you cannot use the illumined mind, then try to remain between the awakened mind and the illumined mind. But do not remain directly in the awakened mind. If you have got a big mind, and with your big mind you are trying to be generous, kind and hospitable, then you will be in trouble.</p>
<p>I am catching your mind; you have made mistakes. You have to know that, when the hour strikes, people come; and again, when the hour strikes, people go. We cannot make them stay on the spiritual path. It is very difficult, because our heart's magnanimity comes to the fore and we want to use kindness. We see that so-and-so has been with us for so many years. For years and years somebody was on the top of the tree eating most delicious fruit. Now that particular person has come down, and there is every possibility that a hungry wolf or tiger will be waiting at the foot of the tree to devour him. But what can we do? Only at the top of the tree can he be safe.</p>
<p>I tell you, I make the same mistake; but in my case, I do not give up. In your case, you make the mistake and after two days you give up. But because I deal with the soul, I struggle and struggle and struggle. Some people who left our path ten or twelve years ago still very kindly show up at my heart's door. At that time, my door is still not closed. Are you thinking of someone who left the path ten years ago? For you, enough is enough. But I go on trying to help them.</p>
