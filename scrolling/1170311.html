 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Sri Chinmoy, what is your definition of the Guru?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Guru is a Sanskrit word which means teacher. The one who illumines is called a Guru. Now, according to my own inner realisation, I wish to say that there is and there can be only one Guru and that is the Supreme. No human being can be a Guru. But although the Supreme alone is the real Guru, here on earth we value time. If we have someone who can help us in our journey towards the highest Goal, we take his help.</p>
<p>We need a human Guru precisely because we want to go faster. A Guru is a private tutor. He is not like a school teacher who will pass or fail the student in the examination. The Guru privately and inwardly teaches the disciples to stand in front of ignorance and face it and conquer it. A spiritual Master is like the eldest member in the family, and the seekers are like his younger spiritual brothers and sisters. Spiritual Masters tell or show their younger brothers and sisters where their Father is. The Father is bound to be the Absolute Guru. All the spiritual Masters are trying to help their younger brothers and sisters and show these aspiring souls where the real Guru is. The real Guru is not in the vast blue skies. He is inside the very depth of our hearts.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask, if He is inside our hearts, then why is it necessary for us to take help from somebody else? I wish to say that this invaluable treasure is inside our hearts, but we have misplaced it, so we need help. A friend of ours who is the spiritual teacher comes to us and searches for our treasure. When he finds it, he tells us, “Look, here is your treasure and here is the key. Now if you want me to show you how to open the box, that also I will do for you.” And then when we see the treasure inside the box, immediately we come to realise that the treasure belongs entirely to us and does not belong to our helper. Now that we have seen the treasure, now that we have discovered it with the help of the friend, guide or teacher, we feel that it is necessary to have so that we can do more things in life.</p>
<p>To see the treasure is one thing, to grow into it is another and finally to manifest it is something else. There are three different things that we take one by one. First we try to realise God with the help of a teacher, then we try to reveal God in our activities and finally we try to manifest God.</p>
<p>The real Guru, the only Guru, is God the Supreme. He is manifesting Himself in and through all the seekers. We are all seekers, and a spiritual Master is also a seeker. But in the family, the younger members usually take help from the elder ones. All so-called spiritual Masters are trying to take their younger brothers and sisters to the Father, the Absolute Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why does one need a Guru?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why does one need a Guru?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this world you usually need a teacher to learn something. So how is it that in God-knowledge, which is also a subject, you don’t need a teacher? Even before you went to school to study English, your mother taught you the ABC’s. Your mother was your teacher at that time. If your mother had not taught you the ABC’s you would not have learned them. Spirituality or God-realisation is a subject, and for this subject you need a Master.</p>
<p>When you complete a course you no longer need a teacher. If you want to learn how to sing, you go to a singer to learn from him. If you want to be a dancer, you go to a dancer. Once you become a singer or dancer, you don’t have to go to your teacher. In the spiritual life also, it is the same. You need help in the beginning, and once you also realise God, you don’t need anybody’s help.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does a Guru represent God to his students?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does a Guru represent God to his students?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the aspirant has a spiritual Master, then he has to feel that for him his Master represents God on earth and everything will come to him from and through the Master. If one constantly separates God from his representative, the Guru, then one is bound to meet with constant frustration. And if one does not renew one’s love, devotion and surrender on the spiritual path under the guidance of one’s Master, then dark forces will disturb and destroy the balance of that individual’s human mind. The desiring vital, the uncertain life and the doubting mind can never offer satisfaction, peace and joy to a seeker. Unless an aspirant is totally sure of his inner journey and has complete confidence in his spiritual guide, he is bound to enter back into the world of illusion and delusion, where he has remained for many incarnations. The spiritual Master has a broad heart which houses understanding, wisdom, action and reaction. He is just an instrument of the Supreme. As a messenger from above, he plays his role on earth, especially for his disciples. He is happy only when he executes the Will of the Supreme. Again, he is happy when the disciples are happy with what they have and what they are. But a time comes when the disciples feel that their happiness can have meaning only when it is founded on the Supreme’s Happiness. Right now we are living in an undivine world of personality and individuality. An aspirant’s divine personality is his oneness with his Inner Pilot, or his Guru. An aspirant’s divine individuality is to fulfil his Inner Pilot in and through his own life. So let the disciple always live in the world of divine personality and divine individuality. Then the disciple will be divinely fulfilled and the Master will be supremely manifested. A real aspirant has to feel that he is for God. Whether God is for him or not, is up to God.</p>
<p>If any of my disciples want to go to God directly or go to God through a church, synagogue or other spiritual place, I will not prevent them. I do not want to create any misunderstanding between God and my disciples. But if you consider me to be your Guru, and at the same time you have no faith in me, then to stay with me is a mere mockery of the spiritual life and a waste of your precious time and my precious time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My hands have a function and my legs also have a function. But my legs will not tell my hands, “Come, let us change our respective jobs.” It is not necessary. My hands are satisfied and my legs are satisfied. When it is time for my hands to work, they work; and when it is time for my legs to work, they also work. But both hands and legs are part and parcel of the same reality, the body. When the disciples merge into the Master’s consciousness, they become inseparably one with the Master’s existence. The disciples are the limbs and the Master is the body; each needs the other. In this way the Master and the disciples go together.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nobody is following me. I tell my students that I am not the leader. The leader is God. Nobody is following my path. It is just that I use the terms “I” and “my.” I tell them that God is the Supreme Leader. But God has told me to inspire my students. I am inspiration only. I tell my students that I am just an inspiration and God is the realisation. God is my leader, your leader, everybody’s leader. God is the Father, my Father, your Father. I tell my spiritual disciples that I am their elder brother. My spiritual development is one inch higher than theirs. The younger brother does not know where the Father is. The elder brother knows a little more than the younger brothers, so he tells them, “Look, there Father is seated.” Then the elder brother’s part is over. He is not the Father and he is not sitting on the throne. But just because he is the older brother in the family, he knows a little more than the younger brothers.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between the terms “Guru,” “Swami” and “Sri&quot;?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between the terms “Guru,” “Swami” and “Sri&amp;quot;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of Gurus. One is a very high spiritual Master and the other one is like a mentor. Tagore, for example, did not claim to be a realised soul, far from it. But his students used to call him “Gurudev,” and he used to sign himself “Gurudev.” In Indian villages, each household must have a Guru. My mother had implicit faith in our Guru. A Guru can be a village-type of Guru, or he can be a very highly advanced soul.</p>
<p>The term “Sri” is used when the disciples feel that their Master has reached a very high state of consciousness. Ordinary people are also sometimes called “Sri"; for example “Sri” is sometimes used to address a minister. Usually one who has realised the Highest will be called “Sri,” like Sri Ramakrishna. Sometimes disciples use two, even three “Sris” for their Master, instead of one. “Sri” is used for the highest spiritual Masters who are far superior to Swamis. Vivekananda, for example, called himself Swami. He would not dare to call himself “Sri” because he knew his status. He was infinitely inferior to his Guru Sri Ramakrishna in terms of height, as was another close disciple, Swami Brahmananda. If these men had achieved their highest realisation, whether others had recognised it or not, they could have called themselves “Sri.” However, if a Swami attains a realisation on a lower level, he cannot be called “Sri” because he is still far inferior. There can be so much difference between one God-realised soul and another. Some ordinary Yogis in India are also far superior to the so-called “Swamis” that I see here. So these days the word “Guru” has become a farce; even Hatha Yoga teachers call themselves “Gurus.” Everything has been twisted. But from the highest point of view, “Sri” and “Guru” go together.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>"The Guru has to be a perfect example of what he teaches"</h2>

<p>You go to school with the idea that the teacher is good, that the school is good. Then, if you study there for a few months and the teacher disappoints you, what do you do? You give up. You don’t believe in that school any longer, so you look for another school. When you are disappointed in a teacher you go to somebody else. And if you are not disappointed in a particular teacher, then you learn from him as much as he can teach you, provided he is very sincere. If he is very sincere but he has taught you as much as he can, then you don’t have to stay with him. You went to him with a sincere belief and your sincerity has carried you along for a couple of years. Now he cannot teach you any longer. So naturally your sincerity will take you to some other place.</p>
<p>There are some teachers who cannot teach you even right from the beginning; they are not real teachers. They do not have the capacity, but they try to keep you as long as they can just to exploit you. There are some sincere teachers who can teach you for a couple of years, and there are some teachers who can teach right up to the highest height. It is you who have to know whether the teacher is sincere or insincere, and then your inner being will tell you whether you are making satisfactory progress or not. The moment you feel that you are not making any progress whatsoever, in spite of your sincerity and deepest eagerness to make progress in the spiritual life, then you should know that the path you are on is not meant for you.</p>
<p>The Guru has to be a perfect example of what he teaches. His outer being has to be the perfect example of what he is saying. Otherwise, he is not a Guru. Books have been written about everything. If you read or think about God-realisation or think of God a thousand times or pray to God, that is not enough to realise God. But the Guru can show you the way to realise God just by a mere touch. The responsibility of a Guru is tremendous. If the Guru is not a perfect example of his teachings, then he is not a true Guru. He is what in the medical world they call a “quack.”</p>
<p>So the disciple must be very, very careful in selecting a Guru. If he makes one mistake in his spiritual life, it is not like an ordinary mistake: his whole life can be ruined. It is not as if he is eating a particular kind of vegetable one day and then if it does not suit his system, he can eat a different vegetable the next day. No, it is not as simple as that. Here if a seeker accepts a Master and if he is not the right Master for that seeker, then the experience can be very destructive. The poor disciple can lose faith even in God. He will say, “God, I was sincere. Why did You bring me to this kind of Guru? I did not know what he was like. I am a blind, innocent, helpless fellow. I was so devoted to my Guru and my Guru deceived me. Now to whom should I go? Must I go to some other Master? He will also deceive me.” At that time the seeker starts judging God. Then the seeker loses all faith in the Guru, in God and in himself. At that time his mind and his heart become a barren desert. There is a saying that before getting married one should think a thousand times about whether or not he will marry a particular person. Similarly, in the spiritual life, before a seeker selects a Guru he should wait a while and dive deep within to see whether that Guru is meant for him or not. If the Master is not meant for the seeker then the seeker should forget him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one teacher, one Guru, and that teacher is the Supreme. I am not a teacher; and if there is anybody on earth who claims to be a teacher, then I will say that he is a fool. But the expression, the manifestation or the revelation of the Supreme is a different story. In the Supreme’s Eye we are all Gods of tomorrow; but when we see with our own eyes, we see that we are all imperfect, we are no better than animals.</p>
<p>The younger brother feels that his older brother, who is studying at the college, has more knowledge or wisdom than he does. So he runs towards his brother to get more illumination. Similarly, in the process of evolution there are those who are actually helping their brothers and sisters who are spiritually younger than they are to lead a life of illumination. The younger members of the family can approach their elder brother as helper or guide or saviour. But it is the Supreme who has given a little more wisdom to that particular person, and at the same time he expects and he demands that this wisdom be distributed to everyone.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can easily know whether you are ready for the spiritual path or not. When you are hungry you know that you have to eat. Your hunger compels you to eat something. In the inner life also when you are hungry for Peace, Light and Bliss, at that time you are ready. When you have that inner cry, that inner need for something, then you are ready for a spiritual path. So when you have the need, you have to realise that you are ready. If you don’t have the need, then you are not ready. Instead of going to a movie or reading newspapers, you have come here. The fact that you have come here to our Centre means that you care for Peace, Light and Bliss. When you go to see a spiritual Master, that means that you are already ready. If you go to church or some other spiritual place, that means you are more than ready to follow a spiritual path. Again, in your readiness you have to know how sincere you can be. You may be ready to go to school and yet you may not be sincere, or you may not be as sincere as somebody else. So sincerity is also necessary, along with readiness. If you are ready and also sincere, then naturally you will go very far.</p>
<p>Just as you know when you are ready to become a student, so also you know when you are ready to become a disciple. If you have a hunger to learn more, or to learn something which you do not know, you go to school. Your hunger compels you to go to a teacher and study; your hunger prepares your readiness. In the spiritual life also, when you are hungry for Peace, Light and Bliss, that means you are already prepared for the spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, each individual should have a path of his own. All roads lead to Rome, but you have to follow one road, one path. Gandhi said, “All religions are leading to the same goal.” Now all religions may have some degree of error, but if you want to go home you have to follow a path. You have to continue walking in spite of any thorns that make it difficult for you to walk. In spite of the imperfections of the path, you have to walk on it if you want to reach your destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We want to go from the finite to the Infinite. God is Infinite and just because He is Infinite, just because He is Omnipotent, He is also in the finite with us. When we stay on earth, we have the body which houses the soul. We should take religion or our path as our own body, as our own individual existence. Then when we go beyond the body and are one with the Infinite, at that time we don’t have to follow a path. But before that if we don’t follow a set path, then we will make no progress. Today it will be this path, tomorrow it will be that path.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does each individual have a specific path or are all paths relatively similar?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does each individual have a specific path or are all paths relatively similar?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All the paths cannot be the same, only the ultimate goal will be the same. There are different roads, but each road leads to the same Goal. Each individual needs the guidance of a Master, and each individual has to discover his own path. Then he must follow only one path and one Master who is the leader or guide of that path. If someone constantly changes paths, then he will never reach his destination.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens that the seeker is ready and the Master is moving around right in front of his nose, but the seeker does not know it. The other day at Fairfield University somebody told me that she has been looking for a Master for nineteen or twenty years and I was so surprised. I was positive that her Master was alive. If she had really been searching sincerely and crying for her Master, then her Master would have appeared before her.</p>
<p>So, here I wish to say that if the aspirant is really sincerely crying for a path, then his path will present itself before him. If he really cries for a spiritual Master, either the Master will come to him or he will be able to go to the Master.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the West I very often come across people who say that they have been searching for a path and a Master but they haven’t found either. At this point I wish to say that their cry is not sincere, and they are not honest in their inner search. No sincere effort ends in vain. If someone makes a sincere effort, then I wish to say that his inner life and outer life are bound to be crowned with success.</p>
<p>So to come back to your question, each individual seeker must necessarily have a path of his own. That doesn’t mean that there will not be other seekers in his path. As we say, “Birds of a feather flock together,” so there will be others who will want to follow the same path. Souls that have a common feeling of oneness do move in groups just like human beings who have relatives, near ones and dear ones. Their souls move together, aspire together and occultly troop through the world at large together. These are the souls that we call group souls, souls that have inner affinities.</p>
<p>As regards his path, each seeker must have one path and not ten paths to lead him towards his goal. It is foolishness to have ten or twelve guides. Spirituality is not like a school where you have a teacher in each subject: history, geography and so on. No. God-realisation is one subject, and for that subject only one teacher is needed to help you to open the door of God-realisation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Accepting the spiritual life is like choosing a friend. Each moment you are standing between two persons, and it is up to you to go to your friend or to your enemy. You cannot say you don’t know which one is your friend. The moment you accept the spiritual life you will know who is your friend and who is your enemy.</p>
<p>Your friend will say, “All right, if he doesn’t want to stay with me, let me not impose on him. What else can I do?” But your enemy will say, “It is beneath my dignity to let him be. I have to grab him and make him my slave.” Your friend will not grab you; only he will try to add to your strength. But your enemy will take you and use you for his own purpose.</p>
<p>The positive force is always there. You are between perfection and destruction. Now it is up to you to run to the room of perfection and not look to the room of imperfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Receptivity and the Master’s Height</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Receptivity and the Master’s Height" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>"Some students find it difficult to learn from the teacher"</h2>

<p>Some students find it difficult to learn from the teacher. The teacher’s way of teaching is too much for them. But if there is a good student in a class, a student who is a little higher or a little better than the other students, then for him it is easier to learn. To be very frank with you, sometimes I may ask a good student to go and convince someone who is not so good. I will not be able to convince the other person even if I take four hours. But if a good disciple speaks to the same person, then in five minutes’ time he will be able to change the person. The good disciple is, say, ten inches higher than the other person, whereas I am ten feet higher. When the disciple talks, the other person sees that the disciple is a little higher than he is, and he listens to him. But my height is so much higher that either he will doubt me or he will be frustrated. First he will doubt me. He will say, “How is it possible that someone can have that much height? It is impossible.” But when he sees that he is just a little below someone’s height, then he will follow the good example of that person. The disciple is an intermediary, let us say, because his height is in-between.</p>
<p>It has happened many times that I fail, because my force is like an atom bomb to the disciples. But if I can give them only a limited amount of power, then they receive it. I always say, “Take according to your capacity. I am like the ocean. If you want to take a small quantity or if you want to take a large quantity, then just take it.” But what happens is this: the moment they see that the quantity is so vast, they forget that they are allowed to take as much or as little as they want to. When they see the vastness, they are frightened to death. They feel that they came to drink just a few drops, but they have found the ocean and its vastness frightens them. Sometimes what do I do? I will show them a swimming pool or a pond. It is true that I have everything, but I if I show them a pond or a river, then they are most receptive.</p>
<p>This has happened many, many times. Let me tell you a true story. I was in a shop in the Virgin Islands, buying a gift, when the owner of the shop came up to me and said, “Do you know the term satsang?’ It is an Indian word, so I said, “Of course, I know,” and I told him the meaning. Then he said, “Do you know of anybody who can initiate me? I am planning to go to India.”</p>
<p>So there in the shop, he was asking me the name of a Master who could initiate him. There in the shop his receptivity was so limited. So I tried to tell the poor fellow that he did not have to go to India. I told him that there are other Masters here. But I didn’t want to tell him that I am also a spiritual Master.</p>
<p>Then I said, “Are you really interested in the spiritual life?” He said, “I am desperately looking for a spiritual Master.” So I told him, “Please come to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There you can attend a meditation.” Then he was interested in knowing who was going to hold the meditation. How was I going to tell him? Finally, I told him that it was I. Then he looked at me with such curiosity. He said he wanted to read some of my books and he gave me his address. Then he said, “All right, I will try to come to Puerto Rico.” But I knew that he would not come.</p>
<p>His soul was crying, but his mind would not accept. At that time if I had been wearing Indian dress, he would have come up to me and touched my feet. Then I would have told him that I can also initiate, and he would have followed me here to Puerto Rico. That is why my sister, Lily, sent me Indian garments when I came here. I said I didn’t want them because I did not like to wear them. But she said, “Who cares for a policeman if he does not have a uniform? And a doctor should always have proper dress; otherwise, nobody will go to him. Once you become well-known, at that time you won’t have to wear Indian dress. But until then you will definitely have to.” I tell you, if I had been wearing Indian garments, at that time the man would have become my disciple.</p>
<p>But if some disciples had been there with me, they could have given a talk about me, and then naturally this man would have believed. Disciples can convince the new seekers. I bring the light, but that light sometimes frightens them. But if the disciples give them light, they can accept it. So that is why I beg the disciples who have been with us to mix with the newcomers. I am the elder brother, the disciples are the younger brothers, and the seekers are the youngest brothers.</p>
<p>God has so many children. Here I am the oldest and there will be some who are younger than you and some who are older than you. So you should take care of those people who are younger than you. Then, when they are older, I will take them.</p>
<p>It has happened that while a spiritual Master is talking to his disciples, visitors join in the meditation. The Master is sitting on the throne. The new seekers, according to their capacity and receptivity, sometimes receive much more than the disciples of the Master. Each time the Master talks, they look not at the Master, but they look at the disciples to see if they approve of what the Master is saying. They feel that they will not be able to judge, for they have just come. So if the disciples are nodding their heads, then immediately the newcomers will feel that the Master is telling the truth. But if the disciples are not serious, then the seekers may start thinking that perhaps the Master is not saying the right thing. So the Master is always judged by those who have already accepted him.</p>
