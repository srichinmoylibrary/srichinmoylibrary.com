MHDI 74-83. These questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 1 April 2006 at P.S. 117 in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: When I meditate, sometimes I can almost get my mind to stop, but then there will be some song going through my mind. It could be one of your songs or some other song that I knew a long time ago. I wish I knew a way of making that stop.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why? If you have had a good meditation, the song will only help you. In your case, they are spiritual songs, soulful songs, so you should be very, very happy. You are lucky. They are not vital, emotional songs — no! If you are hearing soulful, inspiring songs, then you should cherish them. Instead of getting rid of them, you should cherish them. That is a very good experience. The thing that is going to help you, you should value. It is very good to cherish the songs.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Two mornings ago, when I woke up, the first thought that came into my mind was, why did God make it necessary for us to sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Two mornings ago, when I woke up, the first thought that came into my mind was, why did God make it necessary for us to sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God wants us to sleep so that we can forget all our sad experiences. All sad experiences we have to forget. Sleep is the only doctor that can cure us for a short time. Again, after some time, that doctor will also fail.</p>
<p>Sleep is of paramount importance for the present physical body. Six hours you should sleep on an ordinary basis; otherwise, five hours. Do not try to sleep less than five hours, because it will tell upon your health. Sleep is absolutely necessary. All the nerves have to be fed only with the help of sleep. Sleep is not only for patients who are sick. If you want to have good health, then sleep, sleep.</p>
<p>But if you cannot sleep six hours at night for some reason, then during the day try to sleep for an hour or so. It is not good to sleep for more than an hour during the day. In India, they say that if you sleep during the day for more than an hour, all the undivine thoughts will enter into your mind and laziness will descend upon you most powerfully. During the day do not sleep for three, four or five hours. It is very bad for you. At night, try to sleep as much as six hours. And, if you cannot get up at six o'clock to meditate, then get up at seven or eight. But if you get up at eight or even later, then happiness will not dawn on you. You will feel miserable. You will feel that you have so many things to do, and you have wasted the opportunity. Alas, if you go to bed at three or four o'clock in the morning, what can you do? At that time, you have to sleep during the day.</p>
<p>Sleep is absolutely necessary, absolutely necessary, unless you become a real spiritual Master. Then you can sleep a maximum of two hours or three hours per night. Sometimes spiritual Masters are not allowed to sleep because they have to deal with so many problems. The day before yesterday I could not sleep. It is not that sleep was not attacking me! I wanted to sleep, but I had to deal with a very serious problem in the inner world. To solve that serious problem, it took me more than three hours, so you can imagine there was no sleep for me that night.</p>
<p>Then again, sometimes when we have very serious problems, if we use the mind, that very mind will help us sink. If we use the heart, we find that the heart is not strong enough. But if we use the soul and the heart together, it is possible to solve the problems. Of course, the Grace of the Supreme is there.</p>

In other words, if someone says, &quot;I believe that good things are coming now,&quot; is there any power of that self-fulfilling prophecy to turn the forces around and make things better?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you value at all what some people call a &#039;self-fulfilling prophecy&#039;?

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a sad thing happens in your life, there are three ways to approach it. One way is to say, "This will pass away, this will pass away. No darkest night lasts forever. This will also pass."</p>
<p>There is another way, and that is to say, "It could have been worse, it could have been worse." If you repeat a few times, "It could have been worse" or "This will pass away," you will acquire some inner strength.</p>
<p>The third way is to remember a few happy, happier, happiest days in your life. Always I tell people to write down their highest experiences. Then, when you are doomed to disappointment, you can read your own experiences and remember the joy that you got on certain days. It helps to remember. Keep a diary. There you can write down that on such-and-such date something significant happened in your life, and you were absolutely dancing with joy. Then, when everything is going wrong, you can find joy in remembering that experience. Joy is nothing but fragrance. You are carrying a most powerful fragrance with you.</p>
<p>These are the three ways. One way is just to say it will go away. Another way is to say it could have been worse. The third way is to remember your highest experiences. Just glance at the words you have written down. In three or four minutes, you will be inundated with happiness. This is not false happiness. You have every right to remember something that took place in your own life, so remember those happiest days! Then immediately they will give you tremendous joy, and the fragrance-beauty of those happy days will conquer the sad experiences when nothing is going right in your life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I wanted to ask if there is a certain spiritual quality that the cello embodies. Recently you gave two concerts on Long Island and I felt a lot of power and intensity when you were playing the cello.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I wanted to ask if there is a certain spiritual quality that the cello embodies. Recently you gave two concerts on Long Island and I felt a lot of power and intensity when you were playing the cello." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Truth to tell, I am not satisfied with my cello performance. If your consciousness goes high while I am playing the cello, I give all the credit to you, all the credit! When your consciousness goes high, anything that you see in front of you will give you tremendous joy. I give full credit to you, not to the player in me. The higher we go, the better we experience the reality. Do you understand? As a cellist I am not satisfied with my standard. But if you like my cello performance, it is because of your consciousness. I am serious when I say this.</p>
<p>In the cello world, the maestro of maestros is Pablo Casals. In the very evening of his life we met together in Puerto Rico. As soon as he saw me, tears started rolling down his cheeks. They fell on my shoulder. With such joy he was telling me, "You have come at the very evening of my life." Then he played two pieces for me from Bach. His cello playing was sublime.</p>
<p>Another experience I am telling you about my cello. I gave a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in England. Among my disciples, there was someone who could not appreciate my cello performance. As good luck would have it, a member of the audience came up to that person after the concert and said, "How long has Sri Chinmoy been playing?"</p>
<p>The disciple answered, "Three years."</p>
<p>"Three years? I have been playing for seventeen years," that musician said, "but he plays better than I do!"</p>
<p>To that particular disciple who could not appreciate my cello performance, a real cellist came. And he was saying I played better than he did!</p>
<p>Last year I lifted a very famous cellist. His comment was that if I learnt the proper technique, I would enjoy the cello better. To be frank, I only like my cello at one time, and that is when I sing my song for Lord Buddha. If my voice is in good condition, that is the only time I like my cello.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: On the Christmas Trip you said, if I understood correctly, that even when some of us want to be receptive and are crying to make some progress or crying for light in some way, and you try to give it to us, we become frightened or we refuse it. I was wondering if there was something we could do so that we could be more receptive in that way.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: On the Christmas Trip you said, if I understood correctly, that even when some of us want to be receptive and are crying to make some progress or crying for light in some way, and you try to give it to us, we become frightened or we refuse it. I was wondering if there was something we could do so that we could be more receptive in that way." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many ways to create or develop receptivity, many, many ways. Two ways I shall tell you. One way is to imagine inside your heart a most beautiful lotus that is blossoming petal by petal. Then what will you do? You will appreciate the beauty and fragrance of that lotus. While appreciating, first you will see that inside your heart is the lotus. Then, gradually, you will see that your heart is no longer there; your heart has become a lotus. Your heart has disappeared, and only a lotus remains. Then try to appreciate the beauty and fragrance of that lotus. That is going to give you enormous receptivity because you have become one with the beauty and fragrance of the lotus. When you become one with the beauty and fragrance of something that is pure, you are bound to develop receptivity.</p>
<p>Another thing is daily to fix a few times when you will recite either "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme" or "Guru, Guru, Guru," whichever you like. I like "Supreme." He is also our Guru! Three or four times a day, for a few minutes if you recite "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme" or "Guru, Guru, Guru," you can easily develop receptivity.</p>
<p>Sometimes disciples do not receive, sometimes they resist and sometimes they revolt. Again, some disciples who are not as strong as other disciples develop such receptivity during our Christmas Trips! At that time they receive so much from me. To my great joy and astonishment, they make tremendous progress. Then, during the entire year, they do not have to do spiritual work. They can withdraw and withdraw from their spirituality-bank. Again, some excellent disciples receive so much, so much from me during our Christmas Trips. I tell you, it is unimaginable! You have to know which category you belong to.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You have said that sometimes God blesses the world with His Compassion, and sometimes with His Justice-Light.

Is it possible that God may act in various ways in the same situation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us say that some people are doing something wrong and they are getting God's Compassion, whereas others who are doing the same kind of thing are getting God's Justice-Light. Why? We have to believe in the past, and also we have to believe in the future. At what point God may withdraw His Compassion-Height, and at what point God will bring down His Justice-Light, we do not know.</p>
<p>The mind will say that somebody has done something wrong and he deserves punishment. Why is God waiting and waiting? Why is He only showing His Compassion- Height and not His Justice-Light? Nobody will be able to escape God's Justice-Light, but God has His own Hour. Our difficulty is that with our minds we try to bind the time, fix the time. We say, "He is such a bad fellow. He should be punished at this very moment, or in a week or in a month or in a year." Unfortunately, God's choice Hour we do not know. That is why it seems that somebody has escaped punishment. But God's Justice-Light nobody will be able to escape-nobody, nobody. It is a matter of time. God has kept a fixed Hour when that person will be punished.</p>
<p>Again, I wish to say that God's Justice itself is a kind of Compassion. If God uses His Justice-Light, it is for our good. When God uses His Justice-Light, it is to illumine an individual, not to destroy him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should I feel that my spiritual Master is the highest?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should I feel that my spiritual Master is the highest?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters openly declare their God-realisation. Other spiritual Masters secretly tell their choice disciples, very secretly. According to Indian theory, no matter who your Guru is or what his height is, you have to feel that he is the highest.</p>
<p>Do not make the mistake of confusing spiritual power and occult power. Real spirituality has nothing, nothing to do with occult power. Occult power is like some monkeys. They will pinch people this side and that side; they only create a sensation.</p>
<p>While you are on the way to God-realisation, real spiritual powers automatically come. You do not have to beg them. But again, some people pray to God to give them occult power. They want to be satisfied with occult power, not with real spirituality, with God-realisation.</p>
<p>Never be fooled by the display of occult power. When someone shows his occult power, he is surprising all of us. But is there anybody who is really being inspired to go and pray to God either at home or in a church? By the occultist's performances you are excited, you are thrilled, but you are not getting even an iota of inspiration or aspiration to pray and meditate, to increase the power of your prayer-life and meditation-life. But if you go to a spiritual Master, if you go to church, if you have tremendous faith in the Saviour Christ, as you should, then you get so much inner joy, inner feeling.</p>
<p>Never put occult power and real spirituality on the same footing. It will be the height of your stupidity. There are so many spiritual Masters who had tremendous occult power but never used it, never. Again, there are some who did use it. Why? Because God asked them to use it in order to manifest His Light in a special way. But by using occult power, you cannot change anybody's life. Never think that occult power is something needed to make spiritual progress — never, never, never!</p>
<p>Then there is another theory about spiritual Masters. There was a great scholar who was a graduate of Cambridge University. He came to India as a professor of English literature. One day the principal of his university invited the professor to come to his place and eat. O God, as soon as the professor saw the principal's wife, he saw God inside her! She did not pray or meditate, but the professor was a genuine seeker and he recognised her as his Guru. In the beginning, the principal's wife was a little bit embarrassed. Then she started praying and meditating and she went very, very high.</p>
<p>The professor showed such sincere devotion to his Guru that he made tremendous progress. He reached a very high, sublime height. Then this man had to write, "The Guru is higher than God Himself."</p>
<p>How to believe it? The professor explained, "The Guru takes the beating. What is happening inside the real God, if there is a separate God, we do not know. But here we see, when disciples do something wrong — specially close disciples — what kind of beating the Guru gets." He wrote a beautiful article on this theme. Again and again he was justifying his statement that the Guru is higher than God Himself. In one sense, it is ridiculous; but again, the real Guru is God Himself. The God that is inside us and the God that we imagine in Heaven is the same God, the same Guru.</p>
<p>Again and again this professor said, "The one who sees our sufferings and becomes one with our sufferings is higher than God." He did not say whether the God who is upstairs on the highest floor, in Heaven, is suffering or not. He did not want to say, or perhaps he did not even know. But he saw that the Guru in front of him was suffering by becoming one with his suffering, so he felt that this Guru was definitely higher than the Being that we imagine to be God.</p>
<p>Now, let me touch on another point. There are some unfortunate disciples who say, "God knows everything, but my Master does not know everything." By saying that the Guru does not know, if you are a disciple of that type, you are very comfortable. You say, "Oh, I can do all kinds of things because the Master will never know." But who is becoming the loser? The actual loser is you yourself. You are saying, "He does not know, he does not know." Why does the Master even have to know? Why does he have to know what you are doing with your outer life or mental life or vital life? Do whatever you want to, if you have to do it, but do not bring the Master into the picture.</p>
<p>Again, when you do good things you say to yourself, "How I wish the Master knew about it!" At that time, be wise. When you are doing something good, give the credit to the Master by saying, "I am sure the Master has acted in and through me." If you can give the Master or the Supreme the credit, you are doing absolutely the right thing. Just say, "I myself could not have done it. I myself could not have said it. He has acted in and through me. I am only an instrument." Sri Krishna taught us, <em>"Nimitta matram bhava savyasachin"</em> — "Become a mere instrument."</p>
<p>When you pray and meditate, if you pray to the Supreme, I will be the happiest person, believe me, because He is my Guru, He is your Guru. Take Him as the top of the tree and think of me as the foot of the tree. But if you separate me from that tree, you are making a mistake.</p>
<p>The way I have established my oneness with God, unfortunately you have not yet done it. You will also do the same thing, but until you have come to that realisation, always take us as one, take us as one, take us as one. I hope I am making it clear. Pray to the Supreme. I am also praying to the Supreme, but fortunately I have become inseparably one with Him. You will also become inseparably one with Him at God's own Hour, choice Hour. Until that time, try to keep the link, the oneness-link, between me and the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is nothing wrong if you look at this Chinese goddess. Four or five times she came to me before I went to China. If you feel inspired by her, I will not be jealous of her! She is a goddess. Similarly, if you meditate on Mother Kali, I will not be jealous, because Mother Kali is my Mother. If you want to do it sometimes, then do it. I will be the last person to prevent you, because when you become one with God, you become one with all Cosmic Gods and Goddesses. But in your heart of hearts, you have to know always that this Indian Guru is enough for you.</p>

MHDI 84-85. These questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 14 September 2006 at Aspiration-Ground in Jamaica, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: When I look at the moon, I get a special experience, and I believe it is coming through you. I just wanted to ask you, what is your connection to the moon, specially the full moon?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have a closer than the closest connection with the moon and also with the sun. I have received their blessings, appreciation and admiration in boundless measure. I have received boundless love from both the sun and the moon. Many, many experiences I can tell you. Some of you perhaps know about these. Nothing is new. I have told these experiences over the years.</p>
<p>When I was 14 or 15 years old, I was very fond of the moon. Sometimes for hours I used to look at the moon. Once, my friend was seated beside me. I was looking at the moon and talking to Sri Ramakrishna inside the moon. Sri Ramakrishna was full of love and compassion, and we were talking.</p>
<p>That was one experience. Let me tell you another one. Around the moon there are some nymphs. They are beings who can take human form, and they are most beautiful, most beautiful, most beautiful. They dance, and then they try to ruin the aspiration of the seekers. Once, I was gazing at the moon and I was in my highest. Three or four most beautiful women, celestial beings, were descending to try to tempt me. Then I saw Mother Kali cut them into pieces. She amputated their limbs. This is what my Mother Kali did.</p>
<p>I was only looking at the moon and meditating, but there are always these kinds of beings. In Lord Buddha's case those same undivine forces tried to disturb his meditation and take away his inner wealth. In this way the hostile forces attack many, many spiritual Masters. From around the moon, you can say, those beings were descending. And who cut them into pieces? My Mother Kali. That is one of my very sublime experiences with the moon.</p>
<p>Then I had many, many experiences with the moon relating to Lord Shiva. The moon, and specially the full moon — how beautiful, how beautiful, how beautiful it is!</p>
<p>In God's entire Creation, at every moment if we can see beauty, we make progress. We try to see the beauty in everybody, in every being, in every flower — in everything. But again, science has come to show us that there is no such thing as perfection. On the moon, the scientists will see some dark spots. Shall we worship the scientists, or shall we love our heart, the heart that sees the moon and loves the moon and becomes so happy, the heart that swims in the sea of ecstasy? We need that heart, and not the brain of the scientist who sees something wrong in the moon.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy: Lord Sri Krishna was born on a full moon. Lord Buddha was born on a full moon. Also, his realisation was on a full moon and his departure from earth was on a full moon. In Lord Buddha's case, all three took place on a full moon.</p>
