<p>The other day I went out to run at a quarter to four in the morning. I could not believe so many shops were open at that hour here in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Everywhere life is the same. On 150th Street there is construction and here it is the same story. Wherever I tried to run, there was construction.</p>

<p>This morning, I went out to run. As I was leaving the hotel, Adhiratha’s soul came to me. Then just as I turned the corner, I immediately saw him standing there, looking at his watch. He was all ready to start running. He did not see me.</p>
<p>For some reason I changed my mind and went back into the hotel. Adhiratha also changed his mind and went back into the hotel. When he entered the lobby, at that time he saw me.</p>

<p>This morning, when I was out running, I heard the siren of an ambulance. It was coming nearer and nearer. I decided to go up onto the footpath. An old Chinese man was nearby. I have seen him many times. He said to me, “I thought the ambulance was for you!”</p>
<p>“I am ready,” I told him.</p>
<p>He was joking about the way I was running. He used to see me running before I injured my leg. Now I go very slowly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Experiences at the gym</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Experiences at the gym" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Let me tell you an amusing story with regard to my age. Perhaps most of you know that I go to a gym to take exercise, specially for my running, my sprinting. This gym has a smaller than the smallest running track. If you complete four corners, then it becomes one hundred metres.</p>
<p>Anyway, I run that course thirty-two times, so it makes practically two miles. The track is on the third floor and on the second floor there are all kinds of machines, heavy-duty machines, where people can take exercise.</p>
<p>This morning I did my running to my satisfaction and then I came down to the second floor. A middle-aged woman came up to me and said, “Sir, Sir, is it true that you are eighty-one years old?” I think from the second floor she had seen me running.</p>
<p>I said, “I am only fifty-eight.”</p>
<p>“But these people are saying that you are eighty-one,” she replied. “Even then, you look so smart, so trim. You look very strong. Please tell me what you eat.”</p>
<p>I said, “I am a vegetarian, a strict vegetarian.” “But what do you eat?”</p>
<p>“I take tomato, potato and so on,” I explained.</p>
<p>“That is what you eat?” she said. She simply could not believe it.</p>
<p>Databir had taken me to the gym and I was trying to draw his attention, but he was in trance. He has two eyes and one pair of glasses, so four eyes plus his third eye makes five and still he could not see me.</p>
<p>Finally, he came up to me to tell me that he was going to the car to get a press release to show one man who was taking exercise. He said, “I am going to get material for him. I spoke with him a few days ago. He is so nice. He had the same tennis coach as you did.”</p>
<p>This world is so small! This man’s tennis coach was Ronnie, the same one who was my tennis coach. Two weeks ago, the man saw me running and he could not believe that I had so much speed and energy.</p>
<p>When Databir came back, I said to him, “Before you show it to that man, I want you to show it to this lady.” So Databir showed the lady the press release and also my picture. She was very pleased. She said to Databir, “I see an aura on his skin.” She has started meditating, so one day perhaps she will come to meditate with us.</p>

<p>Databir is wonderful! He was absolutely sure that the man he saw working out was the same man with whom we spoke a few days ago, whose tennis coach is Ronnie, my coach. So he went to him with the press release and other material. But the man could not recognise Databir. He said, “I am not the right person.”</p>
<p>Then Databir was insisting that he was the person! Can you imagine? The funniest thing was that that man knew nothing about us.</p>
<p>I said, “Let me go and see him for myself.” I walked about twenty metres so that I could see the man properly and I discovered that it was a totally different person! His hair was different, the structure of the face, everything was different.</p>
<p>Today Databir was really in trance, super-trance!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Embarrassed by his tears</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Embarrassed by his tears" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>About a week ago, I was running along the track at Harbor View Gym. Another gentleman was also running. He was twice as big as me. He was running very slowly, but he saw something in me. When he stopped running, he started talking and talking to Databir. He told Databir that he deals with retarded children. He feels he is taking their karma. A while ago he had a mental breakdown. Now he has just started taking a meditation course.</p>
<p>Databir said to him, “Here is a meditation teacher.” Then Databir invited him to come that evening to our Wednesday night meditation. He came and brought his wife and I gave him a flower. Then he came to our New Year’s Meditation in Manhattan. As soon as he heard me playing my esraj, something happened. He started crying and crying and crying. He was so embarrassed. Right after the esraj, he left. His wife wanted to stay, but he said, “No, I am embarrassed. How can I cry in front of so many people?”</p>
<p>Look at his interpretation! His soul came to the fore and was offering gratitude to the Supreme because he was getting such light, such peace, from Above. But he thought it was unmanly to cry, so he disappeared.</p>
<p>Today he was here at the gym. He said to me, “Sir, how are you?” I smiled at him. Then, for forty-five minutes, he and Databir enjoyed a marathon conversation. I told Databir to tell him that his soul was deeply moved and that is why he cried.</p>

<p>There is an instructor at the gym who happens to be a Mr. Universe. He is very, very kind to me. Alas, now he has come to realise that I am the worst possible student. On his own, for a few days, he tried to come to me when I was working out, telling me that the exercises I was taking were all wrong, wrong, wrong. My position was wrong, my form was wrong and so forth. He wanted to correct my exercises on his own. He is such a nice man, but I am a hopeless case! I continued doing everything in my own way. He greets me now, but he does not come and advise me when I am taking exercise.</p>
<p>One day Databir showed him the picture where I lifted up the police officer who won the bodybuilding contest “New York’s Finest.” So he said to me, “We bodybuilders work so hard, so hard, to develop strength and muscle. But you do not work hard.”</p>
<p>I said, “I do work hard.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” he answered. “You do not stay here, inside the body. You stay a few inches above your head. We stay inside the body, but you stay right over it, a few inches above. That is why it is possible for you to lift such heavy weights. Otherwise, if you lived inside the body, you would not be able to do this kind of thing.”</p>

<p>One day Rupantar took me to the gym. Somehow the owner of the place had come to learn that I am well-known. He came to greet me and then he talked and talked with Rupantar. Rupantar gave him our philosophy. The gym has a bulletin about all their activities, so he wanted my resume. They are going to put it in their magazine.</p>
<p>I must say, the staff are very, very nice there. I have been to quite a few gyms, specially in New York. Sometimes it is very difficult for me to breathe when I go inside. As soon as I get there, I suffer so much from the atmosphere, the vibration. But here the place is neat and clean, and the people are very good. I am very happy to be a member of that gymnasium. It is Harbor View.</p>

<p>This morning I was walking in front of my house. A police car stopped right at the corner and honked. I said to myself, “I am doing nothing wrong; I am only walking.”</p>
<p>When I came near the car, I stopped. The policeman said to me, “Good morning, good morning!”</p>
<p>I responded, “Good morning, good morning!” Then he opened his door and came out of the car. He said to me, “Sri Chinmoy, God is always with you.”</p>
<p>I said, “So is He always with you as well!”</p>
<p>He said, “No, no. God is always with you.” He was not saying “God bless you,” or anything, but “God is always with you.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “You have made my day,” and he went back into his car. This is a policeman whom I have never met before. He was so nice.</p>

<p>Near my house, I saw a boy coming along the street towards me on roller-skates. He was moving very restlessly. He was going forwards, but all of a sudden, what happened? He started skating backwards.</p>
<p>There was a car just three metres behind him. The driver was a Chinese lady. What could she do? There was only a three-metre gap, but she stopped her car immediately. How alert she was! Otherwise, this boy would have gone to God.</p>
<p>I was about twenty metres away, so I saw everything. If anything had happened to the boy, it would not have been the driver’s fault at all. Fortunately, she stopped in time. This is how careless children can be.</p>

<p>For the last few days I have been running. After a long time I have started again. It is pure joy! Today Databir and the guards gave me a cake to celebrate the start of my long-distance running in June 1, 1978. When I think of my long-distance running, I remember only cramps, cramps, cramps. When you have cramps, your life-breath disappears. When I run a short distance, I do not have a problem with cramps.</p>

<p>I would like to show you a video of my recent running performances. This is specially for those who belong to my Inspiration Club and who encourage me every week to continue. This is my progress report. I may not run fast, but I am very devotedly and diligently practising. I practise whenever my legs permit me. I have done 400 metres in 1:34.53. When I come back from the Christmas holiday, I hope I can make some progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Turned away at the door</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Turned away at the door" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I was thinking of one unfortunate experience I had in Fort Lauderdale many years ago. One night I had run quite a few miles and I became very hungry. Luckily I had money with me, so I stopped at a restaurant. Because I was wearing running shorts, they would not allow me to enter. So I decided to try another restaurant. Again, the same story: my clothing was not suitable. They told me to go home and change. Then I tried another restaurant and again I was turned away. I was so hungry. By then it was only a matter of half a mile to go home and change and come back, but I did not do it. My pride was hurt.</p>

<p>This morning I took my tennis court guards to guard me while I was running. I was walking and running. The Mother Earth felt how happy I was! I saw one elderly gentleman running. He was wearing a headband. My guards were watching me with such compassion and he was observing everything. He came up to me and said, “It is so nice of you to take care of so many young men!”</p>
