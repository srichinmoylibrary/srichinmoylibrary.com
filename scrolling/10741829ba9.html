<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes it happens. If a person is not conscious of his development, then there is some possibility that he will surrender to wrong forces and will be compelled to do witchcraft instead of being a good occultist. Somebody can be developed in humility, somebody can be developed in some other good quality; but if he does not develop wisdom, then there is danger. If a bad fellow invites him, he may join that person.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes they do. I have personal experiences of some witchcraft in Florida, where I came across an occultist who was expert in all these undivine things. Those who are black magicians also have all kinds of undivine forces around them or in their room. Only occultists will see something on the physical plane. But ordinary people may feel tremendous uneasiness if these things take place around them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not so easily. Sometimes yes and sometimes no. People come to us and say that they are victims. They themselves practise black magic, but they don’t have enough strength to fight the wrong forces. One woman used to come and cry that her husband had asked a witch to create an undivine force around her. Then later she admitted that she herself used to practise witchcraft.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all from undivine, occult forces. Occult forces can create these things. That is why sometimes when you read Greek mythology, you are frightened to death. Some of the fairy tales are also true. If you don’t believe them, nothing happens. But sometimes, if you do believe, they can have power. I shall give one incident. You are cooking and you are using a spoon. You are about to place the spoon here when the thought comes that if you do this, then your brother will die in a plane crash. You may say it is all a silly idea, but you are frightened. Then, that particular force will tell you to put the spoon in another place. Or an idea has come that if you walk this way, your mother will die. So you walk a different way, and immediately the thought comes that your mother is not going to die. But the fear that she may die has entered into you. The very fact that you have changed your route means that you have surrendered to these forces. Then tomorrow, something may say, “Open the book to page sixty-four before you start studying; otherwise, you will fail in your examination.” The force has attacked you. So you open to page sixty-four out of fear and you are finished. Then, tomorrow that force will tell you that if you read the book, you will fail. Then you surrender and you don’t read the book. Fear can constantly worry you and take your mind away. In my case, I have told stories about how I used to put a black dot on my heel before I did the pole vault. But that was not superstition. It was only divine forces playing with me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some occult power, forces, have the capacity to disintegrate existence-reality. Therefore, we notice the disappearance of the ships.</p>
<p>Also, some Indian spiritual Masters have consciously and deliberately taken away the five elements that constitute the physical body and dissolved them for a couple of hours. Then they revitalised them at a different place.</p>

For example, when a person sleeps in a pyramid-shaped room, they say he needs very little sleep." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no such place, where you need only two hours of sleep because of the shape. Your need of sleep depends on the condition of the inner body; it does not depend on outer circumstances. It is not possible that the pyramid shape is causing people to have these experiences. Perhaps there is a special kind of force, a conscious force, working there, but it has nothing to do with the shape. What can shape do? If you have faith that the shape is the cause, then you may convince someone else. He will tell a third party, and so on. But it is not true.</p>
<p>In this world we do believe and we do have faith. Recently, I read in a book about a kind of shaver which the astronauts had used. Immediately when we hear the name of the astronauts, it is almost like hearing about God. We think that since <em>they</em> used something, it must be special. Just because the astronauts used something, people buy it. When I was in Europe, I went to a store where they had one of the shavers which I had read about. I bought the shaver; but I tell you, that shaver was far inferior to my regular one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The moon is in touch with an infinitely higher consciousness than any ordinary human being can offer. But a human being who has realised God can easily transcend the moon’s consciousness. I have millions of times entered the moon world. When the astronauts went to the moon, I felt miserable because the astronauts couldn’t see anything. But there are so many beings there. When the astronauts landed on the moon, there were so many beings welcoming them. I was watching on television that day, and on the television screen I saw three beings — such beautiful, powerful beings. Usually when a foreigner comes, immediately we become suspicious: is he good, is he bad? But in the case of the moon, the beings there felt that they were appreciated and loved and that was why the astronauts were coming.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Disciple: Is there life on other planets?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Disciple: Is there life on other planets?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the other planets, there is no actual plant life or human life. When it is a matter of physical existence, you have to know that it comes only from the five elements, and these are found only on earth. But there are living things in other worlds. The soul itself is a living thing. The subtle physical is living, the subtle vital is living, the subtle mind is living. Anything that is in its subtle form is real and has life.</p>
<p>In the higher worlds which we call Heaven, you will see big, big trees. But there is no actual physical tree in this plane of consciousness. Form is there, although with your physical eyes you cannot see it. But with the intuitive eye, with the third eye, easily you can see it. In these other worlds, there are also beings, but they are not like us. If you use the mind, the mind will bring forward a form; the mind conceives of everything the way it does on earth, so you will see them as human beings. But if you try to touch them to see if they are flesh and blood, they won’t be there. You won’t feel bones or muscles or anything like that, because their form is not on the physical plane. Also, they can take form themselves. They can take form and frighten you. When they come from the vital world, they can really be frightening. They actually bring solid power with them, undivine power. When you conquer them on the physical plane, they burst like a balloon.</p>
<p>Here on earth we identify with the physical form. Once we see the form, it is recorded in our mind. This is Joe’s face. If somebody else’s face comes, we recognise that it is not Joe. In other galaxies it is different. Even if the form totally changes, it doesn’t matter, because the identification is with the soul proper, and not with the physical form. If someone saw you at the age of ten, and now you are forty, he will not recognise that it is the same person. But in other galaxies, no matter which form the soul takes, the soul will be recognisable. You will be able to know who you are and others can also know because you are the same soul.</p>
<p>The planets themselves are all living and when I go to the planets I talk to them. Just today I was talking to Jupiter. The planets can take any form they want to. It can be the form of a human being, it can be the form of an animal, it can be the form of a tree. It may look as though they have a physical form, but it is not on the gross physical plane. Our physical is composed of five elements, whereas the reality of these beings is composed of Peace, Light and Bliss. But life is definitely there; otherwise, how could I talk and mix with them?</p>
<p>So, life is in all the galaxies. But life that takes physical form is found only on earth. There is physical life, there is universal life, there is transcendental life and there is immortal life. Inside earth-bound life, this span of fifty or eighty years, immortal life is there, hiding. Again, universal and transcendental life is also there. Immortal life is in all the galaxies. It is our aspiring consciousness that is aware of the immortal life inside the transitory life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on earth, not only physical manifestation but all kinds of manifestation can take place. Heaven is perfect from one point of view. You can take rest there after you have played your game on earth. But in Heaven there is no realisation, no manifestation; for this we have to come to earth.</p>
<p>Life is everywhere, and the existence of the soul is everywhere in all the galaxies. But some souls enter into the earth for the transformation of the physical consciousness. On this planet, the souls that enter into the physical plane care for physical transformation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is quite possible to travel to other planets. The occultists usually use one process; the Yogis use another process. Again, there are some spiritually developed seekers who are neither occultists nor Yogis, and they use still another process. The mediums also use a means. Some people travel through the astral tube, which they develop through the practice of kundalini yoga and specific concentration on the chakras. But the Yogi usually does not do that. If he wants to do it, he can; but in his case, by virtue of his intuitive power, he can immediately enter and become one with the astral plane or any plane of consciousness. Because of his oneness with the universal Reality, he has a free access to the astral plane. Or if he uses his intuitive power, he sees that he is already there on the other planets. He does not have to go there. He does it through identification and oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The souls of human beings may pass through the planets when they are coming down from the soul’s world and entering into this world. While coming down, they may create some special connection or friendship with a particular planet. Spiritual Masters do it while they are here. Spiritual Masters, while living on the physical plane, can bring down qualities and capacities and realities from these planets. If they care for the beauty aspect, they will get it from one planet; power they will get from another planet. They can bring down Light, Peace and Bliss from these higher worlds on the strength of their concentration and meditation power.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who thinks of them in that way? The planets to me are worlds. Mars is a world, a plane of consciousness. Jupiter is a world. Jupiter is most dignified. It has wisdom. Pluto is the most beautiful planet. Venus carries the love aspect. It is like that.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is like human beings on earth. Each one has good qualities, but these qualities are not all coming together at any one point. When you come out with all your best qualities, at that time I may bring out all my undivine qualities. Usually, the best qualities of all the planets are not put together. Each one will keep its best qualities to itself.</p>
