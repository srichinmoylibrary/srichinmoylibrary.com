<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the soul's world it was all pre-recorded that these people would die together on a particular day and at a particular hour. It is like a game. Either you are playing individually or you are playing collectively. At home, for example, you may be doing juggling all by yourself or you may be playing some other game together with a few people. Here it is exactly the same. These particular souls may not be at all connected with one another; only they are destined to have the same death hour. So these souls are put in the plane together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When a soul is born in a particular body, does it always stay in that body until the body dies, or does a more advanced soul sometimes take over the body for a particular mission?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When a soul is born in a particular body, does it always stay in that body until the body dies, or does a more advanced soul sometimes take over the body for a particular mission?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually one soul is enough, but every rule admits of exception. On very rare occasions — perhaps one time out of a billion or a trillion — if it is the Will of the Supreme, the soul can be taken away and another can be put in its place. If it is the Will of the Supreme, not only the soul but also the heart can be changed; occultists can do it. Almost always the heart tries to listen to the soul, but sometimes the heart fails because the vital and mind are putting tremendous pressure on it. At that time the heart becomes confused and does not see the light. So if somebody has accepted the spiritual life and the heart is not progressing fast enough, if it is the Will of the Supreme, then the Supreme can change the heart and put in a different one. For various inner reasons it can be done.</p>
<p>When the heart does not listen to the soul, or when the mind or vital or body revolts and does not listen to the soul, then the soul's journey is delayed. At that time the soul cannot run the fastest or manifest God's Will. The soul, heart, vital, mind and body are like members of a family. If you have four children, sometimes one or two listen to you and the rest do not listen. Occasionally, to your extreme sorrow, all your children revolt at the same time. In the seeker's case, not only the mind but also the vital and the body may revolt. And even the heart may be shrouded in darkness. Then it can be a very deplorable situation, for all the children are really bad. But in almost all cases the soul acts like a very compassionate parent. The soul is willing to wait and wait indefinitely in the hope that the children will one day become good. It will wait for thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy years with the hope that the body, vital, mind and heart will all become good members of the spiritual family.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Someone will not know that his heart has been replaced, but he will have better feelings, higher feelings. Somebody may have had a bad mind for many years, but now he is thinking good thoughts, encouraging thoughts, ennobling thoughts. The individual will see the difference, but he will not know how it was done. He will not know whether it was God's Grace or the Master's grace or some divine force that has acted.</p>
<p>An individual knows his own mind. Two years ago or twenty years ago he knows what kind of mind he had. He knows his weaknesses. For years and years, let us say, someone suffered from insecurity and jealousy. But now that individual has very little jealousy, very little insecurity. Overnight how could this have happened? He did not even specifically pray for it, but now it has all changed!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In one incarnation one cannot develop a very close connection with someone. The closeness and intimacy that some disciples have with one another, or with their Master, in most cases is due to connections made in previous incarnations. Closeness with the Master can be the result of a few or more close incarnations, or the result of the fastest progress that an individual made in one or two incarnations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I give the soul what it needs and wants from me. Sometimes a soul will come to me for consolation because the body, vital, mind and heart are not listening to it. Sometimes it will come for peace because in the body, vital and mind there is no peace. Each soul comes for its own reason. There are many, many souls that come to me from people who are not my students. In some way these souls have established an access to my soul, and in the inner world these souls know who I am.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! If you wake up at any time during the night, for any reason, you will feel something if you wash your eyes, ears and nose and then meditate for five minutes on your bed. You do not have to sit in front of your shrine, and you do not have to sit cross-legged; but you must sit properly — with your spine erect.</p>
<p>Then imagine a particular colour. If you want to feel God's infinite Love for you, think of the colour blue. If you want God's infinite Energy or Strength, then think of the colour green. If you want God's Delight or Happiness, then think of the colour purple. You can imagine any colour, but blue is very good because blue represents Infinity. When you invoke Infinity, if it sees that your vessel is very limited, it tries to increase your receptivity by giving you more enthusiasm or eagerness. At that time it acts like a mother. The child has such eagerness to lift up ten pounds, but he has the capacity to lift up only five pounds. So Infinity, like a mother, immediately gives the child the strength, energy, joy and enthusiasm so that he can lift up ten pounds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should the anniversary of the soul&#039;s departure from the earth-plane be celebrated as well as its birthday?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should the anniversary of the soul&#039;s departure from the earth-plane be celebrated as well as its birthday?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some family members are very attached to their parents and children, while others are not. In the same way, some souls keep a very close connection to their family members after death. They come not only to observe the anniversary of their departure but also quite a few times during the year. Some souls, not so much out of attachment as out of affection and genuine love, try to inspire their dear ones who are still on earth to become better human beings. These souls come when their dear ones are meditating. But again, some souls do not come at all because they want their dear ones to be more detached. They want their dear ones to think only of the Highest, of God, instead of thinking about their departed relatives.</p>
<p>If someone here on earth very sincerely invokes the soul of a departed dear one on that person's death anniversary, most of the time that soul will come unless it is on a very high plane. Highly developed souls sometimes do not want to come because they are countless miles away from us. For them, it is a difficult journey because of our lack of purity. Ordinary human beings are full of desires. They do not or cannot keep their consciousness pure even when they invoke their dear ones. The passageway between the relative's prayers and the soul's compassion is like a column of light. If the light is not pure, then it is very difficult for a high soul to travel through that passageway. Again, some souls are very brave. As soon as they hear the sincere invitation, they come, no matter how difficult it is for them. But if the person on earth is praying with pure concern and a very pure heart, then it is quite easy for them to come.</p>
<p>Usually, once a year on the death anniversary, people think of their dear ones and pray for them very soulfully. When they pray intensely, at that time they are likely to have purity also. When one is intensely concentrating on something, at that time one does not look around or allow outside thoughts to enter one's mind. So intensity often brings absolute purity. To invoke a soul from the soul's world, both purity and intensity are needed. With purity you go one step, and with intensity you go ten steps.</p>
<p>But if those on earth are seekers, they need not wait a year before invoking the souls of their dear ones. If they want to feel the presence of their dear ones, they can try any time they want. To wait for one year before invoking their dear ones or thinking of them is not advisable. Again, you have to know that after a few years of rest, most souls again take human incarnation. After ten or twenty years, if you are still observing the anniversary of someone's death, thinking that the person is still in Heaven, you are not going to get a visit from that soul. Most probably that person has already taken human birth in some other family. Once the soul has taken a human body again and entered into the ordinary world, it can no longer travel, even with difficulty, to visit those who are invoking it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul returns to the soul's region, it will not carry the human portion of the mind with it. It will leave the mind on the mental plane. Whatever good or bad qualities the mind has will remain there. If the soul forgives the mind and wants to take the same mind again, it can. Otherwise, that mind will be given to another soul. The same mind will not usually be taken by the soul. But if the soul wants to take the same mind, it will get first preference.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When the mind is taken by another soul, does the mind carry the karma from its previous life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When the mind is taken by another soul, does the mind carry the karma from its previous life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind will keep the essence of all the bad qualities that it had; this is its punishment or karma. The essence of these bad qualities is like a very powerful dose of homeopathic medicine; it has tremendous potency. You will take two pellets of homeopathic medicine and in a second your boil will burst! Can you believe this potency! So, like that, the mind carries with it the full potency of the bad qualities it embodied. That is why the mind is not more evolved or more illumined. Also, that is why the mind is not all of a sudden illumined when it goes to the mind's world. When you have earned only one dollar, you cannot expect suddenly to get one thousand dollars.</p>
<p>So the mind suffers most of the time. Only if the person had an accidental death — a sudden car accident, for example — will the mind not get punishment. Again, if a person lives for a long time, it is possible for the mind to nullify its karma. Let us say that someone had many bad thoughts or was very cruel to others for ten or twenty years. If this person begins to pray and meditate and tries to lead a good life for the next twenty years, then while he is on earth he can purify or illumine or nullify his mind's bad qualities. Unfortunately, for many people it works the other way. When they are young, they have a pure mind, a broad mind, a sympathetic mind; then gradually, gradually they develop a greedy and destructive mind. So all their mind's good qualities are nullified.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Isn&#039;t the vital as destructive as the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Isn&#039;t the vital as destructive as the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The vital is destructive; it is true. But the vital is more likely than the mind to listen to the heart. In many instances the vital can touch the heart or the heart can touch the vital. In some people the vital is very strong; they are very restless and destructive. But when the heart touches the vital and the vital sees the joy and love of the heart, at that time the vital surrenders. But it is very difficult for the heart to touch the intellectual mind or the sophisticated mind.</p>
<p>That is why spiritual Masters find it so difficult to deal with mental people; they are the worst! Immediately the mind of the mental person starts judging the Master; it wants to scrutinise his wisdom instead of trying to become one with it. As soon as the useless, third-class student starts judging and criticising the professor, the student is lost. When the student, who is worse than the worst, feels that the professor does not know anything, then the student will never be able to learn from the professor. Again, if the mind can be illumined, it is a great achievement; but most of the time it is very difficult to deal with the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind has to feel that the heart and soul are superior. If the mind becomes humble or modest and feels that something else is superior, then humility and purity enable the mind to progress and offer concern, compassion and the feeling of oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases it is the mind — especially if somebody is mentally predominant. Again, even if the mind is not properly developed, it is usually the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but it is the soul's continuity. It is all the experience of the soul, which is the divine in us. The soul is one hundred percent divine, whereas the heart, mind and vital are not fully divine. In each incarnation the soul tries to illumine the heart, mind and vital. The soul has taken up the challenge to perfect all the members of the family. Sometimes it is so painful: the soul is begging the mind to be more divine, but the mind will not listen.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do people with a soul&#039;s connection look alike?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do people with a soul&#039;s connection look alike?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When two persons are really fond of one another, they try to emulate or imitate one another's good qualities so they can be more worthy. If they are really fond of one another, each one thinks that the other one is super-excellent. So a woman will say, "She is beautiful. Since I am her friend, let me try to be as beautiful as she is." A man will say, "He is such a good warrior; he is such a great singer. Let me try to be like him." They have such feelings for one another that they try to be the same. They feel their oneness and want to be indivisible. So if you really care for someone and have tremendous love for that person, then even on the physical plane you want to resemble one another. Many, many times you can see the soul's connection in the face. Again, in many cases there is no physical resemblance at all. Two people may have a very strong soul's connection but look totally different.</p>
