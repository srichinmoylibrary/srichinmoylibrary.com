  <h2 id="page-title">Who carries the worse luck?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Who carries the worse luck?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day, early in the morning, Akbar met with one of his subjects. Later that day, something unfortunate happened. While the Emperor was having breakfast, he ate a strand of hair that was in his food. He said that just because he had seen that particular man, this had happened and he wanted the man to be punished. Some others at the Emperor's court agreed that this man carried very bad luck. Akbar said, "Then he should be hanged."</p>
<p>The poor man was supposed to be hanged on the following day. He knew that the Emperor's court Minister, Birbal, was aware of his plight, so he went to the Minister and begged for help. But the Minister said, "The Emperor wants to have you killed. How can I dare to save you? Impossible!"</p>
<p>"No, you must save me, you must save me," begged the man.</p>
<p>"How?" said the court Minister. "I cannot prevent the Emperor's order from being executed."</p>
<p>Then suddenly the Minister leaned over and whispered something into the man's ear.</p>
<p>The following day, the time came for the man to be hanged. Akbar said to him, "Are you ready?"</p>
<p>The man said, "O Akbar, greatest of Moghul Emperors, you are saying that because you saw me, your fate became most deplorable. Now, can I not also say that because I saw you, my fate has become most deplorable? Had I not seen you, I would not be facing my death at this moment. I may have caused you some bad luck, true, but in my life you have caused me worse luck. You will stay here on earth, but I have to die. So I ask you, who carries the worse luck?"</p>
<p>The Emperor said, "I have lost the case," and the man was set free.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The foolish and the wise</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The foolish and the wise" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar once asked his Minister, "Birbal, tell me, who are the wise people on earth and who are the fools?"</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "Your Majesty, the wise people are those who perform their duties and do not leave anything incomplete. Once they have undertaken something, they complete it. The fools are those who never fulfil their duties."</p>
<p>"Why are these people fools?" asked Akbar.</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "They are fools because they have to come back to earth again and again. If they do not complete their work in this incarnation, they will have to do it in their next incarnation. They are fools to come back to this earth again in order to finish the work that they could have done in one incarnation."</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>In the spiritual life, the wise are those who want to complete their first and foremost task in this incarnation. Their only work, their main duty, is to realise God. The beginning of their work is aspiration; the end of their work is realisation.</p>
<p>Wise people know that there are many things to do. They know that if they do not start working, they will never be able to accomplish what they want to accomplish. So they start right away before they lose either the inclination or the capacity to do the work.</p>
<p>The wise do three things correctly. First they cry for God. Then they become one with God. Finally they work for God. But the fools do not cry for God. They do not care to become one with God, and they do not want to fulfil God. This is the difference between a fool and a wise man. The fools have the capacity to do this work, but they do not utilise it. Unless they utilise their capacity, unless they accomplish their duty, which is God- realisation, they will never be satisfied. So the fools have to start working like the wise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The darkness of the mind</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The darkness of the mind" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar said to his Minister, "Birbal, for a long time I have been thinking of one question. I am sure you will be able to answer it. We see everything clearly in the sunlight, but is there anything that cannot be seen even with the help of sunlight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your Majesty, there is something that cannot be seen in the sunlight. Even the sunlight fails to illumine it."</p>
<p>"What is it, Birbal?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, it is the darkness of the mind."</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>Birbal's answer is absolutely correct. The only question that Birbal might not have been in a position to answer is whether there is anything that can show us the ignorance of the mind and illumine it. Even if he had been able to answer this question, he still would not have been able to actually illumine the darkness of anybody's mind.</p>
<p>How do we illumine the mind? We illumine the dark, unlit, obscure, impure mind by bringing to the fore our inner sun. The outer sun can show us only earthly objects, but the inner sun can show us what the mind is, how it operates and what it contains. We bring the inner sun to the fore by digging deep within. When we dig very deep into the ground we reach water. Similarly, when we dig very deep into ourselves, we reach our inner sun.</p>
<p>There is not only one inner sun, but many. How many we bring to the fore depends on how we dig and how deep we dig. If we dig deep within most soulfully, in the way the Supreme wants us to dig, then we discover many inner suns, and we can easily bring them to the fore.</p>
<p>Yet, when we have brought our inner suns to the fore, our role is not over. First we illumine our own inner and outer existence, and then we try to illumine the world around us: our friends, our relatives, our dear ones. Finally we try to illumine the entire world. But first we have to dig deep within in order to get in touch with our own inner suns.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The power to punish</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The power to punish" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Akbar asked his Ministers, "Tell me, who is superior, God or me?"</p>
<p>The Ministers were all amused by this question. Outwardly they acted very serious and made the Emperor feel that he had asked a most significant and difficult question, but inwardly they were all laughing at Akbar for being foolish enough to try to compare himself with God.</p>
<p>At last Birbal came forward and said, "I can answer this question. Undoubtedly you are far superior to God."</p>
<p>Akbar was outwardly amused, but inwardly he was deeply pleased. He challenged Birbal, "Prove that I am superior to God."</p>
<p>Birbal said, "Your Majesty, when somebody commits a very serious crime, you have the power to punish him. You have the power to place him in a prison cell for the rest of his life. But poor God! He created everything and the whole creation belongs to Him, yet He does not have the power to give a lifelong sentence to anybody. His Power of Compassion is infinitely more powerful than His Power of Justice. He cannot punish anybody the way you do. So you are far superior to God, because you have the power to punish severely."</p>
<p>Akbar was satisfied and pleased with this answer, but the Ministers were all amused.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>The judgement of equals is condemnation and punishment. But the judgement of the One who is really superior is identification and illumination.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Universal jealousy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Universal jealousy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar asked Birbal, "How is it that there is no hair on my palm? There is hair everywhere else on my body. How is it that there is none on the palm of my hand?"</p>
<p>Birbal answered, "It is because you always have plenty of money in your hands, and you give it away in charity. Your palms are being rubbed constantly, so the hair there has all been rubbed away."</p>
<p>"But how is it that <em>you</em> do not have hair on <em>your</em> palms either?"</p>
<p>"Just because I constantly receive money from you, my palms are always being rubbed. You are constantly giving me money and I am constantly receiving it. That is why we have no hair on our palms."</p>
<p>"But what about those who do not get money from me the way you do? Why do they not have hair on their palms?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is because they are very jealous. Jealous people are always thinking of the money that you are giving me and that I am receiving from you. They constantly rub their hands together in anticipation of receiving some money. They are always burning with jealousy and greed, and so they just rub and rub their palms together. That is why they do not have any hair on their palms either."</p>
<p>Akbar was highly amused and pleased; but those who were listening to Birbal were terribly embarrassed at his accusation, and they bowed their heads in shame.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>By being jealous of what the giver has or of what the receiver gets, one can never have joy or peace of mind. In order to be constantly happy, one has to identify himself with Reality's source and Reality's course, with Reality's glow and Reality's flow.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Heaven and hell</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Heaven and hell" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar once asked Birbal, "After death, who are the people that go to Heaven and who are the people that go to hell?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," replied the Minister, "only clever people go to Heaven after death. The fools go to hell."</p>
<p>"Why is that?" asked the Emperor. "Why do the clever people go to Heaven? How do they become clever?"</p>
<p>"They become clever by knowing that there is only one thing worth having, and that is love. When they give love to the world and receive love from the world in return, everything is done. Only those who love the world and get love from the world are clever, and they go to Heaven. Those who do not love the world and do not get love from the world go to hell."</p>
<p>The Emperor was silent.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>Birbal's answer is almost perfect. His only mistake is to say "clever" when what he really means is "wise." Now we have to know whether we love the world for its own sake, or whether we love God inside the world. If we feel that the Creator and the creation are one, then by loving the Creator of the world we can love His creation as well. Otherwise, we will love the world and expect love from the world in return. And if we do not get love from the world, we will feel sad and miserable.</p>
<p>According to spiritual philosophy, only those who love God in mankind and do not expect anything in return go to the real Heaven. Only those who offer love constantly and unconditionally to God in man can go to the highest abode of peace, light and bliss after death. Those who do not do that will naturally go to an inferior world where these divine qualities are found in less than sufficient measure.</p>
<p>Again, where is Heaven? Heaven is not just a place where we go after death. We go to Heaven and hell every day. Heaven and hell are states of consciousness. In the perfection of the mind, in the peace of the mind, Heaven abides. In the frustration of the mind, in the depression of the mind, hell lives. Every day we experience Heaven and hell in our lives. Frustration, depression, insecurity, worry, doubt, fear, anxiety and jealousy all make us live in hell. Security, beauty, joy, peace, light and love all allow us to dwell in Heaven at every moment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Akbar is superior to Indra</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Akbar is superior to Indra" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Akbar asked his Ministers and the others present in his court, "Tell me frankly, who is superior: Indra, the Lord of the Gods, or me? Be very frank."</p>
<p>Everybody was shocked, and nobody dared to answer. If they said that Indra was superior to Akbar, Akbar would be displeased. And if they said that Akbar was superior to Indra, it would be a real lie. So they all kept silent.</p>
<p>Finally Birbal came forward and said, "I have the answer."</p>
<p>"Then tell me," said Akbar.</p>
<p>Birbal proclaimed, "You are superior."</p>
<p>Akbar was outwardly amused and inwardly pleased. "Prove it," he said.</p>
<p>"That is very easy," replied Birbal. "When the Creator created you and Indra, He put both of you on a scale. On one side He placed you, and on the other side He placed Indra. Just because you were heavier than Indra, you dropped down to earth and Indra remained up in Heaven. So you see, you are superior because you are heavier. You are more fulfilling for earth. That is why you have become the Emperor of the world."</p>
<p>Akbar was very happy. He thought, "Indra remains high because he is light. I came down because of my superior weight. That is why I remain on earth."</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>Everybody was happy with this answer. But poor Akbar did not get the point. He did not understand that Birbal really meant that Indra was superior. Akbar thought that just because he was heavier in weight, he had more power.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, a seeker sits on the scale every day. God places his wisdom on one side of the scale and his ignorance on the other side. The seeker always finds that his ignorance is heavier, much heavier than his knowledge and wisdom. Then he feels miserable. So he tries to pray, he tries to meditate, and gradually he increases his knowledge and inner wisdom. Simultaneously, on the other side of the scale, his ignorance becomes lighter and lighter.</p>
<p>Finally, a day comes when he has only knowledge. His ignorance has all been devoured or illumined by his inner knowledge. When there is nothing on the other side of the scale, the knowledge side drops down to earth again and the seeker enters into the world to work for mankind with his newly acquired wisdom. With this wisdom-power he tries to conquer the ignorance of the world.</p>

<p>Birbal was not only a Minister but also the court jester. He used to amuse Akbar with his wit, his talent and his earthly wisdom. As a result, Akbar was very fond of Birbal.</p>
<p>One day the Emperor was a bit upset. Birbal happened to displease him while he was in this mood, and he burst out, "You are the son of an ass!"</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and the other Ministers were jealous of Birbal because he was Akbar's favourite.</p>
<p>One day, in front of the Emperor, the Prime Minister said to Birbal, "Well now, the Emperor and I have decided to give you a job. We feel that you will be able to do this job better than anybody else."</p>
<p>The Minister asked, "May I know what the job is?"</p>
<p>"From now on you will be the master of all the dogs in the Empire. You will be in charge of them, and they will have to obey you."</p>
<p>Immediately the Minister said, "Since you have given me this post, let me ask you to stand up. I am the master of all the dogs in the Empire, and you also belong to that group, so you have to listen to me. Stand up then!"</p>
<p>Akbar was most amused by this reply.</p>

<p>One of the palace dogs was hungry, so Birbal placed some food before him and Akbar did the same. The dog did not touch the food offered to him by the Minister, but he ate all the food given to him by the Emperor.</p>
<p>Akbar asked Birbal, "How is it that the dog did not touch your food, whereas he ate up all of my food?"</p>
<p>The Minister's reply was, "Your Majesty, you should know that even a dog wants to remain faithful to his caste!"</p>

<p>Akbar and Birbal were walking together along the street. It was a very hot day, and after a while the Emperor took off his new coat and handed it to the Minister to carry. The Minister received the coat gladly, and they continued walking.</p>
<p>All on a sudden the Emperor said, "I am sorry that you are carrying my coat. It is so heavy. You are carrying the load that a donkey should carry."</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "I am happy that I am carrying only the coat of a donkey, and that the donkey itself is not on my back."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Four first-class fools</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Four first-class fools" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once Akbar asked Birbal to bring him four of the world's worst possible fools. So the following morning Birbal began looking for the fools.</p>
<p>The first fool he saw was a Brahmin. This Brahmin was running very fast carrying a plate of betel-nut, rice and a few other things. When the Minister asked the Brahmin why he was running, the Brahmin answered, "My wife has just given birth to a son, and I am bringing her the ceremonial foods. Unfortunately, the boy is not my child, but his father will also be there. So I am going to bless the new father and mother, and the baby. That is why I am running."</p>
<p>"Ah!" thought the Minister, "I have got my first fool," and he told the Brahmin to come to the court with him.</p>
<p>"No, no, no! I cannot come to the court," protested the Brahmin. "I have to see my wife."</p>
<p>Birbal declared, "I am the Emperor's Minister. It is the Emperor's command that I take you," and he showed the Brahmin his identification. So the foolish Brahmin had to go to Akbar's palace.</p>
<p>On the way, they saw a man sitting on a horse. On his shoulders was a very heavy load. Birbal asked him, "Why are you carrying that load on your shoulders?"</p>
<p>The man replied, "My horse is a mare, and she is pregnant. I do not want to hurt this poor animal by making her carry such a heavy burden, so I have put the load on my own shoulders."</p>
<p>Birbal said, "If you are sitting on the horse, the weight will be the same whether it is on your shoulders or on the back of the horse." But the man insisted that he was taking half the burden on his own shoulders.</p>
<p>"Here is another fool," Birbal said to himself, and he commanded this fellow to come along to the Emperor.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," proclaimed the Minister when they came before Akbar, "here are your fools."</p>
<p>"I asked you to bring me four fools, did I not?" said Akbar. "Where are the other two?"</p>
<p>"I have two here," replied Birbal, and he narrated their foolish actions to the Emperor. Then he said, "The third fool is you, your Majesty. Who but a fool is interested in seeing fools? You get pleasure in knowing that there are horrible fools in your Empire, whereas a wise Emperor would like to know whether there are wise men in his Empire. Since fools give you pleasure, you also belong to their group, for birds of a feather flock together.</p>
<p>"And I am the fourth fool. I listen to your foolish commands and waste my precious life carrying them out. Only a fool would obey the commands of a fool, so that makes me the fourth fool."</p>

<p>Once Akbar asked Birbal to bring him the bravest person and the most cowardly person he could find. The following day the Minister brought only one person to the Emperor. The Emperor became angry. "How is it that you have brought only one person?" he shouted. "I wanted to see two different persons with two different characters."</p>
<p>"Please do not be angry, your Majesty," said Birbal. "You wanted to see both cowardice and bravery. If I can show you both these qualities in one person, will you not be satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Certainly I will," replied Akbar. "But it is impossible for someone to be at once the bravest and the most cowardly person."</p>
<p>"No, it is not," said the Minister, "and I will prove it to you." With that, he presented to the Emperor a young and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>"I will tell you in what way she is very brave, and in what way she is very timid. This girl will walk miles through the pouring rain on a deserted road at midnight in order to visit her boyfriend. At that time of night no man would dare go where she goes alone without a thought for her own safety. But when this girl is at home with her husband, if a tiny mouse makes a noise or a little cockroach crawls by, she will be frightened to death. She will stand on a chair and scream until someone chases it away. So you can see that she is at once the bravest and the most cowardly person."</p>
<p>Akbar was satisfied with his Minister's choice.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The depth of gratitude and the height of ingratitude</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The depth of gratitude and the height of ingratitude" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Akbar wanted to see two creatures: the most ungrateful and the most grateful beings on earth. So he asked Birbal to bring before him, on the following morning, the most ungrateful creature and the most grateful creature on earth.</p>
<p>The poor Minister was thrown into a sea of doubt and worry. Whom should he select? Birbal had never lost in any of his little games with the Emperor, but if he could not bring these two creatures to the palace the next day, the Emperor would be terribly disappointed. Also, everybody would know that at last the Minister had been beaten in the game, and perhaps the Emperor would appoint somebody else to take his place. Birbal thought and thought, and at last he decided whom he would take to the Emperor.</p>
<p>The following day he asked his son-in-law to come with him to the palace, and he also brought his own dog. When he entered Akbar's presence with his dog, Akbar became angry. "You fool," he shouted. "Why are you bringing your dog into my palace?"</p>
<p>"Please wait, your Majesty," said Birbal.</p>
<p>"I told you to bring me the most grateful and the most ungrateful beings on earth," said the Emperor. "I see only one person and this dog. Now, how are you going to fulfil the wish I expressed yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, this is my son-in-law," explained Birbal. "No matter what I give him — thousands of rupees, clothes, furniture, anything — he is never grateful. On the contrary, he always feels that he deserves more. He feels that he has done me the greatest possible favour by marrying my daughter. All sons-in-law think that when they marry someone's daughter they are doing him a tremendous favour, so naturally they deserve everything from him. So you see, I have given him my dearest daughter, my money, my house, my prestige, everything, and still he is not satisfied. He will never be grateful.</p>
<p>"Now look at this dog. I give the dog practically nothing — just a little food (and sometimes I even forget to give him that) and a floor to sleep on. But how grateful, how faithful, how devoted he is. All the time he stays in front of my door, eager to protect me. If somebody wanted to commit a theft or hurt me, he would bark and bite, and chase the culprit away. All dogs are like this. Give them a piece of bread and they are ready to die for you. Look at the gratitude of the dog. This is the difference between the most ungrateful being and the most grateful being."</p>
<p>Then Akbar cried, "Why should we keep this ungrateful being on earth? Your son-in-law must be killed immediately. All ungrateful persons should be killed!"</p>
<p>But the Minister quickly responded, "Why only <em>my</em> son-in-law? If <em>my</em> son-in-law must be killed, then all sons-in-law must be killed, for they are all ungrateful to almost the same extent."</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Akbar, "all sons-in-law have to be killed. Since all sons-in-law fall into the same category, they all have to be killed!"</p>
<p>The Emperor was about to order all sons-in-law to be brought to the palace and executed when the Minister said, "Wait, your Majesty."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>"You are also somebody's son-in-law," said the Minister. "Why, the Queen's father is living right here in the palace. That means you also have to be killed."</p>
<p>At this, Akbar changed his mind, and nobody was killed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The blind always outnumber the men of sight</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The blind always outnumber the men of sight" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day Akbar asked Birbal, "In this world are there more blind people or more people who have sight? Tell me who outnumber whom — the men with sight or the men without sight?"</p>
<p>Birbal immediately answered, "The men without sight by far outnumber those with sight. There are many more blind people on earth than people with vision."</p>
<p>"You have to prove it," said the Emperor.</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "I shall prove it tomorrow."</p>
<p>Every morning the Minister used to enter the palace at nine o'clock, but the following day, instead of going in as usual, he sat at the palace gate sewing a piece of cloth. He had a needle and thread and a piece of cloth, and he was sewing like a girl. One by one, as his fellow Ministers and other officials passed him on their way in, they all asked, "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>As soon as each person asked, "What are you doing?" Birbal wrote his name on a list.</p>
<p>After a while, Akbar himself passed by, coming in from his morning walk. "What are you doing out here?" he asked the Minister. The Minister just smiled and put Akbar's name at the very top of the list.</p>
<p>Now the Prime Minister was a shrewd man, and he always used to find fault with the other Ministers. When he came by, he said, "Why are you sitting out here sewing? You lazy fellow, it is high time for you to enter the palace. There is much work for you to do. Is this your job, this silly sewing? You are neglecting your real work." The Prime Minister was the only one who actually mentioned what Birbal was doing, while scolding him for neglecting his real duty. His was the only name that did not go on the list.</p>
<p>After an hour or so, Birbal went to the Emperor and said, "Now, your Majesty, I can prove to you that the blind people are more in number than the men with vision."</p>
<p>"Tell me how you can prove it," said Akbar.</p>
<p>Birbal replied, "Here is the proof!" and he handed his list to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Akbar saw his own name at the top of the list and exclaimed, "I am blind?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Birbal. "You are the Emperor, the father of this Empire. You are the eye of this vast Empire, but you are blind. When you saw me sewing in front of the palace this morning, you asked me what I was doing. I had a needle, I had thread, I had cloth, and I was obviously sewing. But you and all the other people on this list asked me what I was doing. The only man who did not ask me what I was doing was the Prime Minister. He just scolded me and insulted me because I was neglecting my duties here. He is the only one with sight."</p>
