SCA 395-399. Sri Chinmoy was asked these questions by his disciples on 6 January 1995 during his visit to Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Question: What is the future of religion?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Religion represents the earthly aspect of the divinity that the Saviour Christ, or Sri Krishna, the Lord Buddha and others embodied. It represents the body or the outer garment of their divinity. The body cannot last; only the consciousness, the inner divinity that was and forever is being manifested in and through Jesus Christ, Lord Buddha and others, will last and last and last.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that when people worship in the future, they will be more aware of the fact that we belong to one spiritual family. There was a time when even this idea was too much for the world. Now at least we are able to speak about it. It is like the idea of peace. Fifty years ago the word ‘peace’ was not used as it is now; they used other words. But in the last nine or ten years everybody is speaking about peace. Although one country may be dropping a bomb on another country, ‘peace’ is still our mantra! A day shall come when not only will the rest of the world laugh at this particular country, but even this country will start laughing at itself. It will realise that it is only talking about peace but doing just the opposite. At that time it will try to correct itself.</p>
<p>The threat of nuclear destruction will not go on, because even in thirty or forty or fifty years the power of the heart will be much, much stronger. There is great hope that politics will eventually surrender to spirituality. Individual cases we have already seen in history — the Indian King Shivaji, for example. First he did things in his own way, and later he surrendered to divinity. So the inner world is awakening. In some cases in the present-day world, the inner power is becoming more prominent and vivid outwardly. You see how Russia is suffering now in the political world, but in the inner world Russia is awakened. Russia’s inner power and inner awakening will become quite surprising and astonishing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why have you travelled to so many countries and appreciated so many countries and individuals?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why have you travelled to so many countries and appreciated so many countries and individuals?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters are accepted in this country or that country because their divinity is infinitely more manifested in certain places. But in my case, I have gone to many places. I have travelled from country to country, holding Peace Concerts, meditating and writing songs about the souls of the countries. You ask why? For me, the soul of each country is real; the heart of each country is real. I see the divinity that is trying to be manifested in and through each country, in and through each individual, and in my songs I appreciate it and try to bring it forward.</p>
<p>If you have a heart of appreciation, then everything is beautiful; you see each petal of each flower as absolutely unique and beautiful. My little finger is not as strong as my index finger, but to me it is very cute. And the thumb is so strong! So each finger I look at I am appreciating. You may say it is a waste of time to travel so much. But if I can go from country to country appreciating this person who has inspired mankind or inspiring that person who has done something great, then I feel that I am really doing something worthwhile. It is inspiration that is holding up the entire universe. God Himself was inspired, and that is why He created this universe.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not have to worry about what will happen in the future, even if I do not leave behind one perfect or first-class disciple, not to speak of an unconditionally surrendered disciple. Why? Because my creations will stand for me. True, some of my writings, my paintings, my birds, my songs and so forth may be third class, fourth class, even no class! But some of them have touched the very heights of divinity. The quintessence of many of the most sacred books of the past you will find in my writings, and I have composed many prayerful and soulful songs. Again, the soul-birds that I have drawn have abundant inner light. So my writings, my paintings and my music, which are my children, will continue to manifest my light.</p>

But after the Master leaves, it becomes a religion — like Buddhism, for example — and it stands against other religions." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, I only speak about the soul. My philosophy is that the soul is the only reality and at every second we have to listen to our souls. I have not said a word against any religion. On the contrary, I have expressed the greatest love, admiration and adoration for the Saviour Christ, the Buddha, Sri Krishna and the spiritual Masters associated with other religions. So why should my path become a religion and stand against other religions? My writings will make it very, very clear that I was not a man who directly or indirectly tried to establish a new religion. After my departure, the world will see only my creations.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because I am a little more advanced than you, I can see my Beloved Supreme inside each and every one of you. Sri Ramakrishna used to tell Vivekananda, “I am seeing in you God Himself. I can talk to Him face to face.” Was he a liar of the first water? Never! This was his authentic inner experience.</p>
<p>You can do the same. First try to imagine the Supreme inside me. Then you can try to feel His Presence inside me. The same Supreme is in you as well, but for you to feel the Presence of the Supreme inside yourself is infinitely, infinitely more difficult than for you to imagine or feel His Presence inside your Guru. It is much easier for you to find and get the Supreme in me. So on the strength of your imagination and inspiration, please try to feel the Supreme inside me first. Then only will you be able to see and feel it inside yourself. At that time the game will be complete.</p>

SCA 400-401. Questions answered on 28 December 1994.</p>
<h2>Question: Did you have any inner experience when you arrived in Myanmar?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been to many, many countries, and the soul of each country has offered me tremendous affection, love, appreciation, admiration and even adoration. But from the soul of Burma I got a new experience. Around 4:30 this morning, the soul came up to me with such affection and began scolding. She said, “Why did you not come to visit me at least fifteen years ago? What was wrong with you?” Such a powerful, emotional scolding she gave me, but it was full of affection! Like an aunt she was talking to me: “How many times you visited India, but not even once did you visit your aunt!” No other country ever has scolded me, but this one has really blessed me with her most affectionate emotional feelings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Lord Buddha was born in Nepal, but when it is a matter of Lord Buddha’s consciousness, I can say that the whole land of Burma is flooded with Lord Buddha’s compassion-tears. Here in Burma I feel the Buddha’s consciousness even when I walk along the street. God alone knows what is happening in the political sphere, but from the religious and spiritual point of view, Burma is the land of Lord Buddha’s heart.</p>

<h2>Prayer to Lord Buddha</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>O Lord Buddha, O Light of the world, O new pathfinder of humanity’s liberation, we have just invoked your blessingful presence. We have felt and are still feeling the blessings divine and supreme that you have bestowed upon us — upon our heart of aspiration and our life of dedication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years, I have been to a number of countries that follow the teachings of the Lord Buddha. But here, in Myanmar, I feel that the Lord Buddha has a very, very special eye of compassion and a very, very special heart of universal love. Myanmar, I feel, has a most special place in the heart of Lord Buddha. The depths of silence, the beauty of simplicity and the hunger for life’s perfection I see and I feel in the aspiring and self-giving soul of Myanmar — blessed child of the immortal world-liberator, Lord Buddha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Buddha, to your life as a human being I bow. To your supreme attainment of nirvana, <em>parinirvana</em> and <em>mahaparinirvana</em> I bow. You blessed us with the message of continual transcendence in the physical when you attained nirvana and, right after leaving the mortal sheath, <em>parinirvana.</em> Then, at the choice Hour of the highest Transcendental Supreme, you entered into <em>mahaparinirvana.</em></p>
<p>The Silence of the Absolute Supreme and ever-unknowable Reality blessed you and claimed you as its own to liberate humanity from the sufferings of ignorance. Lord Buddha, to the human in you we bow. To the divine in you we bow. To the ever-transcending Reality in you we bow and bow and bow.</p>
