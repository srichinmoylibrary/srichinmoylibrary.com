  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What should I do during meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What should I do during meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have a picture of me in my transcendental consciousness. Look at that picture and try to empty your mind. If thoughts come into your mind and are creating problems for you, try to empty them. Throw them into the consciousness which you observe in my picture during your meditation. Try to throw away or destroy fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, jealousy and other undivine thoughts. If you have divine thoughts, thoughts of love for the world, or service to God, or thoughts about happiness and peace, then you should treasure them. But try to make the mind as quiet and calm as possible.</p>
<p>If you have a few friends who are aspiring, such as your brother and sister disciples, then automatically you will be inspired by them. Their aspiration itself is strength. So as long as you do not have a Centre in Santa Cruz, please try to come to San Francisco as often as possible. And when they can, the disciples of the San Francisco Centre will go to your place and inspire you. If you keep the place where you meditate pure and spiritual, they will definitely want to meditate at your place even if you do not have one other disciple there. Your own sincerity and spirituality will be appreciated and admired.</p>
<p>The door of this Centre will remain always open to you and to other disciples who belong to other Centres. If you are in a position to come from time to time to get inspiration from the San Francisco Centre, you are most welcome. This Centre is doing extremely well. If members of other Centres need inspiration and want to increase their aspiration, they should come here. Members of this Centre should invite you to come here so that you can receive their inspiration and aspiration, and when your Centres grow up, you should invite them. If the Centres in Phoenix, Vancouver and Victoria do well, they will invite the San Francisco Centre to visit them.</p>
<p>But right now I wish you to come here as often as possible, because from here you will be able to receive and achieve abundant light. There are people here who have been with us for some time and have accepted the path wholeheartedly. You will get tremendous inspiration from them. The San Francisco Centre is well founded, well established and very solid. So if you come here, you will get solid strength, illumining inspiration and fulfilling aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best time for meditation is early in the morning. When you get up, that is the best time. If you get up at 5:30, that is the best time. If you get up at 6:00, that is the best time. If you get up at 9:00, that too will be the best time, but you have to know that at that hour you will be swimming against the current. By that time the world has become full of noise and activities; everything is hustle and bustle. But if you get up at 5:00 or 6:00 or 7:00, you will still feel poise and peace in the atmosphere. So the earlier you can get up, the better.</p>
<p>Now, the length of time depends on your capacity. If you can meditate well for fifteen minutes, then do so. But if you just sit at your shrine for two hours, although your mind begins roaming after ten minutes, that is of no use. As long as you can meditate soulfully, you should meditate. But if you are just dragging it out and watching the clock to see how many hours you have meditated, that is of no use. If you can meditate well for fifteen minutes in the morning, that is more than enough.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we always see the divine qualities in others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we always see the divine qualities in others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you do not see the divine qualities in another person, you will feel that you are seeing a tiger, a snake, a panther, a bull or some other animal; you will see jealousy, doubt, fear or other negative qualities. When you see undivine qualities in others, you have to feel that these are ferocious animals. Then what will happen? Those ferocious animals will devour you. If you see a tiger in front of you, do you think the tiger will just go away? The very nature of a tiger is to devour you. If you see the undivine qualities in others, then immediately those ferocious animals will come and devour you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you see in each person a divine child, or a beautiful flower, or a burning candle symbolising the ascent of the flame of aspiration, you will be full of joy. If you see inside them somebody praying and meditating, or a most luminous, divine child, you will be full of joy. If you see the divine in a person, then your strength, inspiration and aspiration will increase. Every divine quality that you have will increase. The moment you think that you see an undivine quality in someone else, feel that your whole hand is full of ink. You are soiled. You can wash it with a good thought. But if you touch the ink again, even though you have washed your hand once, it will again become dirty and black.</p>
<p>If you do not look for the negative qualities, automatically the positive qualities come forward. It is like this: either you like a person or you dislike him. If you do not dislike someone, automatically you like him. It is either one or the other; there is nothing in between. At a given moment, either you are thinking of God or you are thinking of Satan. At every moment the mind is either thinking of something positive and creative or of something negative and destructive.</p>
<p>So the best thing is to see the positive things in others. If you consciously see the positive things, then the negative qualities cannot come forward.</p>

What can I do to clear my head so I can be stronger in my mind and soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Constantly thinking that your mind is bothering you and that it is full of undivine thoughts is not good. By doing this, you will have no clear idea of truth. If the mind is constantly involved in our so-called aspiration, then we will not succeed.</p>
<p>The mind is like a sick person. Let us say you have two brothers. One brother is sick all the time, and the other brother is strong and healthy. If you constantly think of the brother who is sick, then you will also feel sick. If you go to the hospital four or five times a day, then you are bound to feel that you are sick, although the doctors will find nothing wrong with you.</p>
<p>If you spend most of your time with your sick brother, which is the mind, then you will be affected. But if you spend most of your time with your strong, healthy brother, the heart, then you will get strength and energy. When you have become strong, then the two strong brothers can go to help the poor sick brother, the mind. Always try to think of the heart. It is not that you are rejecting or avoiding the mind, but right now you are not strong enough to cure the mind. You are not powerful enough. Only with the added strength of your heart will you be able to go to the mind to make it spiritually stronger.</p>

<p>Dipti Nivas will always remain a temple. Every time I am here, I feel the presence of the cosmic gods and goddesses most powerfully. People who are working here and serving this restaurant are serving the Supreme directly: this is true. But something else is infinitely more true: you people are really fortunate here. You may work nine or ten hours a day, but you are working in a place where the Supreme has most special Blessings. His presence and His children’s presence — that is to say the presence of the cosmic gods and goddesses — is very powerful here.</p>
<p>To each of you I offer my blessingful gratitude for serving the Supreme here. Please maintain the same height, the same standard, which I have been noticing again and again. There is no end to our progress. I really want you people to transcend and transcend. I transcended my transcendental Consciousness in 1970. My transcendental Consciousness, where I am one with the highest Absolute, would have always been more than enough for me, but there is no end to our progress. You people can also transcend, in the same way that I have transcended. The divinity that I see here can be increased by your own aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I sometimes wonder if you ever get tired and discouraged. You have the most difficult job that has ever existed.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I sometimes wonder if you ever get tired and discouraged. You have the most difficult job that has ever existed." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of the time I remain in the soul and in the heart, and then I am not discouraged. But when I am in the physical consciousness of earth, sometimes, as a human being, I am discouraged. If I ask you a hundred times not to do something and then you do it, I do become discouraged. But I have infinite patience; otherwise, I could not have accepted so many spiritual children. When I am displeased with someone, people may think that I am scolding that person mercilessly. But at that time it is not the human in me that is speaking. It is the divine authority in me that I have to exercise.</p>
<p>Our path is the path of love, devotion and surrender. Love is the most powerful force. But sometimes when love does not work, we must use divine force, which is another form of love. This force is called concern. But our concern is sometimes misunderstood. If I have expressed my concern, then you have to know that I am using a kind of force. If I did not use this power of concern, then I would be totally frustrated. I tell my dear disciples that when I scold them, they should feel that they are the luckiest people on earth. When a spiritual Master becomes indifferent to a disciple, that is the disciple’s death blow. If you go on and on doing something wrong, I will scold you up to a point. But once I withdraw my concern, once I show indifference to you, that is your spiritual death-blow. If I am really discouraged and disheartened by a particular disciple, then naturally I will withdraw from that disciple.</p>
<p>The divine in me has infinite patience, compassion and concern. I try again and again with the disciples who consciously and deliberately violate my rules. But if I keep them in the Centre indefinitely, they will just poison the good disciples. What right do I have to keep the sick people and contaminate the healthy ones? They are sick because they do not want to become healthy. They are tired, they are exhausted, they are weak. If you are strong, you can climb the Himalayas. But if you are not strong, then you have to sit at the foot of the Himalayas. The spiritual life is for the strong and the willing.</p>
<p>Again, when disciples lose their aspiration and leave us, usually they do not go to other Masters. They just give up the spiritual life altogether. If they think that I am a bad Master and they go to some other Master, then I am very happy. That Master will then take them to the goal. But they usually do not do this. When they leave us, they just criticise us and try to take a few more disciples with them by speaking ill of us. At that time the human in me does get discouraged, because I see that the infinite love and concern that I gave them while they were with us was all wasted. Naturally the human in me feels sad. But the divine in me will say, “If they are such fools, if they are being tempted, then they are not for us, they are not worth keeping.” My disciples know what is right and what is wrong. If I identify with the human in me, I may feel sad. But, inside the human is the divine. In the case of a spiritual Master the human may come to the fore for a short time, but then the divine will come and solve the problem. It was when the human in the Christ came forward for a fleeting second that he said, “Father, why hast Thou forsaken me?” But then the divine immediately came forward and he said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>Three years ago in one of my Centres, some of the disciples who had been with us for four years were still going to different groups and seeing other Masters. Then, when they came to see me, they created unnecessary problems with their doubt and confusion. For a long time the human in me just forgave them and did not pay any attention to their misbehaviour. But after a while I got exasperated. Then I had to show some divine authority.</p>
<p>I just said, “I am sick of you people! Please leave me. You people are just exploiting my compassion. I want to make my boat quite empty, so that it will go very fast.” I have told my disciples so many times that they cannot make progress if they go on changing from one path to another. There can be only one path, one boat at a time. So when I saw that the disciples were creating problems for themselves and others by going to various paths and various teachers, then naturally I had every reason to be discouraged.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a matter of inner love and an inner bond, like the connection between a mother and son, let us say. Even if the mother lives in India and the son has come to America to study, the mother’s heart is all the time inside the son, and the son’s heart is all the time inside the mother. Even while the son is talking to his professors and colleagues, he can feel his mother’s presence constantly inside his heart. When he sees something beautiful he thinks, “If only my mother could see this, she would be so happy.” If he does well in his studies, and the teacher appreciates him, immediately he thinks, “Oh, how I wish my mother could hear this.” If something goes wrong, he will think, “Where is my mother to ease my sufferings?” His mother is always vivid in his consciousness, because he has established his loving oneness with his mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should try to establish that kind of oneness with me in every aspect of your life: in your success, in your failure, in your progress. Any time that you accomplish something or see something that pleases you, immediately you will say, “How I wish Guru were here!” Of course, this is only in your physical consciousness. If you have done something really good, I will feel it in my inner being, and if you have done something really bad, then too, my inner being will know it. But if you want to be conscious of your oneness with me at every moment, then whenever you perform an action, whether it is good or bad, immediately think of me. If it is something good or successful, immediately say to yourself, “Oh, I have got so much! How I would like to share it with my Master!” And if it is a failure or something sad or bad, then immediately say, “How can I bear it all by myself? I need my Master.”</p>
<p>In this way you can invoke and feel my presence at every moment. Think of me as a life-long friend who is always beside you, whether you are in the sun or in the rain. Your spiritual Master is your Eternal Friend.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your capacity. If you see that your pets are standing in your way, then you naturally should get rid of them. In India we have a traditional story about a king who used to think of his pet deer so much that when he took another incarnation, he himself became a deer.</p>
<p>If you focus your attention on your pet all the time, you will be making a mistake. The time, attention, love and devotion that you spend on your pets you could easily offer to God instead.</p>
<p>You may feel that you are indispensable to your pets, that if you do not look after them, then they will have no place on earth. But there are many people on earth who will gladly accept them. These people do not have an aspiring consciousness like you have, so the animals will not interfere with their present state of consciousness and development. They will be by far the best people to look after your pets. But if you would like to have one pet, and if you feel that it will not take much of your time, then you can do it. But if you keep three or four cats and a dog, how are you going to have time to pray and meditate?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you offer your soul’s oneness to people who aren’t disciples, without entering into their consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you offer your soul’s oneness to people who aren’t disciples, without entering into their consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to remember that you are trying to offer something to the divine in that person. The divine in each person is God. So when you see a person, please do not think of that person as a human being. Think of him as a representative of something divine, of God. Then naturally your attention will be focused on the divine in him. Everybody does not have to follow the same spiritual path as you. One boat is not big enough to hold all of humanity. A person need not have a Master; he need not follow a spiritual path. But inside him the Supreme exists, just as inside you the Supreme exists. It is the same Supreme. If you know that the Supreme exists in others just as He exists in you, then your problem will be solved.</p>
<p>We have come into the world to conquer our pride, but after we meditate or follow a spiritual path for a short time, a kind of spiritual pride enters into us. We feel that we are the only people who embody God. This is very bad. We know that ordinary pride is bad. When we see somebody who is very proud, we laugh at him and say, “Look at his pride.” But spiritual people sometimes become very proud of their inner achievement of Peace, Light and Bliss. When this kind of spiritual pride enters into us, we do not see the divine in others. We feel that it is beneath our dignity to feel oneness with them. We want to see darkness in others so that we can feel that we are at the top of the Himalayas and they are at the foot of the Himalayas. But we should not have that kind of feeling.</p>
<p>As soon as we see someone, we should try to go to the root of that person. The root is God. If we know that the root is God, then there can be no problem, because the moment we look at a person, we will not see the human in him or the animal in him, but the divine in him, the Supreme in him. That person need not be a spiritual seeker at all. If we approach the inner divinity in the other person, we will not have to enter into that person’s human consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is a divine thought, then it is a consciousness that is progressing, like a river that is flowing towards the sea. If it is an undivine thought, then you have to feel that inside the mind there are quite a few flies or insects buzzing and biting, and this thought is one of them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fun, innocent fun, takes away all our tension. If something takes away our tensions, worries and anxieties, then that very thing is as good as meditation. But the fun must be innocent. If it is undivine, unlit, let us say, vulgar fun — then that is forbidden. Innocent fun is a real form of meditation when we want to get rid of tension. Fun immediately relaxes us if it is very simple, innocent and sweet. If it is innocent and pure, then it adds to our aspiration. When our tension is released, we automatically make progress.</p>
<p>When we have fun with our imitations, we have to establish our oneness with the people we are imitating. We have no right to deliberately torture others. If my consciousness in my right hand mocks the consciousness of my left hand, I don’t feel sorry because the consciousness of my right hand and the consciousness of my left hand are one. So if you want to mimic one of your brother or sister disciples, please do it in absolute innocence. The next moment he will also imitate you. But there is a time for this kind of thing. There is a time for us to have breakfast, a time for us to read, a time for us to meditate, and so on. So we shall pray, we shall meditate and, when we have time, we can have some innocent fun. If it is innocent and pure, then it adds to our aspiration. When our tension is released, we automatically make progress. I am sure that nobody will want to do imitations at the time of meditation. But when meditation is over, when you are relaxing, at that time you can do it. If it is very innocent and soulful, it really helps us in our aspiration, just as our Madal Circus helps us in our divine manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can live in the heart the moment you think that you do not have any mind. First think that you have two rooms: one is the heart-room and the other is the mind-room. Now it is up to you whether you will stay in the mind-room or in the heart-room. You don’t have to stay in the mind-room at all. You are wrong if you say, “I have only the mind-room and I must stay there; otherwise, I shall have to stay in the street.” There is another room for you to stay in.</p>
<p>Right now you are staying in one room which is dark. This room will not always remain dark. Today it is dark, but tomorrow it will be illumined. We must do the first thing first. First we have to remain always in the heart-room and then, with the light from the heart-room, we must enter into the mind-room and illumine it. So for the time being, have nothing to do with the mind-room. Later, when you have light, the mind-room need not be neglected.</p>
