 <p></p>
<h2>Question: For what purpose do we have a physical body?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul, which is a conscious, divine portion of God, has to live inside the physical body in order to make progress. Inside the church is the altar. Similarly, the body is a temple, and inside the temple is the shrine, the soul. The body is our outer protection and, at the same time, our instrument for physical manifestation. Without the body the soul is helpless. Until manifestation takes place in the physical world, we cannot offer the real Truth to the world at large. The purpose of the body is to manifest the Reality of the soul. The soul needs the body to manifest the inner Truth, the divine Truth; the body needs the soul to realise the highest Truth. When the soul inspires us to do something, it also gives us the necessary capacity. Unfortunately, the unaspiring body, vital and mind do not obey the dictates of the soul. The body, vital and mind give us messages, but these messages are not the inner dictates of the soul. The desires of the body often directly contradict the divine necessities of the soul, because this material body is unconsciousness itself.</p>
<p>When a person begins to aspire consciously, his entire being gradually starts to aspire. His soul aspires, his heart aspires, his mind aspires, his vital aspires and finally his body aspires. When the physical in the aspirant starts to become one with the soul’s inspiration and aspiration, then God’s Light can find a fit receptacle in him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you mean that the subtle body is a less dense form of matter? Does it interpenetrate or live within the physical body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you mean that the subtle body is a less dense form of matter? Does it interpenetrate or live within the physical body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The subtle body is undoubtedly less dense than the physical body is. We really have three bodies. As we go deep within, these bodies become more subtle. Each person has what is called in Sanskrit <em>sthula sharira</em>, the physical body. Inside the physical there is another body, called <em>sukshma sharira</em>, the subtle body. Inside the subtle body is a third body, called <em>karana sharira</em>, the causal body.</p>
<p>Before the creation started — the creation that we see all around — <em>Hiranyagarbha</em> existed. <em>Hiranyagarbha</em> is a Sanskrit word that means golden womb ( <em>Hiranya</em> means gold and garbha means womb). Our physical eyes will never be able to see or feel this <em>Hiranyagarbha</em>, but it is there that the seed of creation originally germinated. From there the causal body came into existence.</p>
<p>In the causal body we have all qualities in seed form. In the subtle body we begin to get the manifestation of some things that are in the causal body. Finally, we get truth, reality, experiences and realisation in the gross physical body. The physical body is like a huge banyan tree which grows from a tiny seed. When we compare the physical body with the causal body, it is simply unbelievable. This is how the manifestation takes place: from the causal to the subtle, and from the subtle to the gross physical.</p>
<p>The causal body has the capacity to fulfil us, but it fulfils in the process of time, through the evolving wheel which we call evolution. With the causal body the journey begins, but it is with the physical body that we fulfil ourselves, and the universe fulfils itself, through the outer form.</p>
<p>By physical, we mean the outer consciousness of the universe. In its seed form this is <em>karana sharira</em>, but eventually this seed grows into the boundless universe. When it expands, it automatically reaches the highest. You may say that expansion and reaching the highest are two different things. But in God’s case, in the soul’s case, it is not like that. What touches the farthest corner of the universe is meaningless if it has not also reached the highest. God will never remain unfulfilled, and He will never allow us to remain unfulfilled either, so we are bound to reach the highest, farthest and deepest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All of them. Once one gets a real spiritual experience, one sees that experience in all three bodies. When it is a matter of realisation, one sees, feels and becomes the Truth in all three bodies. This is not the case for minor experiences. If it is just an ordinary earthly happening, which is not so important, only the physical or the subtle body will get it. But if it is something serious, important and significant, then the experience will be recorded in all three bodies.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You need not have two physical bodies to live simultaneously in two worlds. One physical body is enough. If you have greatly developed your spiritual faculties, you can function not only in two worlds, but in many worlds or in many places at the same time. The physical body will be in one place, but you can get the knowledge of some other place, some distant place either in this world or in some other world, from your intuitive faculty, your inner vision or your inner beings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The subtle body, which looks and acts exactly like the physical body and can be perceived by others, can appear at one place while the physical body is at another. We leave the physical behind, and with the soul’s light we give form to the subtle physical at any place we want. The things that the soul can accomplish in a fraction of a second will take twenty years if we have to do them in an ordinary earthly way.</p>
<p>But while the soul and the subtle physical are outside the gross physical, the body must not be touched or disturbed in any way. If it is, it loses its purity and divinity, and decay begins immediately. Then the soul finds it very difficult to return. Even under excellent conditions, the soul must return to the body before 11 or 13 hours, or it will find the door closed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible to see the causal or subtle body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible to see the causal or subtle body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The causal body can be seen only by realised souls and great spiritual aspirants. Ordinary persons cannot see the causal body. And most ordinary persons do not see the subtle body either. The subtle body is often seen and felt when our kundalini is awakened, because the kundalini is in the subtle body. It is also seen and felt when a new light descends into our physical body. When a new light descends, in that light all of a sudden we can see the subtle body. There are also other ways to see the subtle body.</p>
<p>When we see the subtle body, we get true confidence in our existence. Right now we contradict ourselves at each moment. This moment we say that we are something and we have something; the next moment we say that we are nothing and we have nothing. But if we frequently see our subtle body, then we get the true confidence that we possess something that is worth having and worth showing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The causal body, the subtle body and the physical body are all, to some extent, impermanent. They lose their existence when the soul leaves the body. As soon as the soul leaves, the physical dissolves into the five elements. But sometimes the causal body stays for a longer time with the soul than the physical and subtle, because the soul’s potentiality is within it in seed form.</p>
<p>Then, when the soul reincarnates, it takes a new causal, a new subtle and a new physical body. First it takes a causal body. Then from the causal comes the subtle body. The subtle body is like the outer body, but we do not see it until we have the inner vision. Then comes the outer body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you develop consciousness in your subtle body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you develop consciousness in your subtle body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciousness is already in the subtle body. Consciousness is functioning most powerfully, vehemently and soulfully in the subtle body, but it is not functioning here on the physical plane. So you should try to develop consciousness in the physical body, the ignorant, lethargic physical body.</p>
<p>Consciousness descends into the subtle body from the causal body. Consciousness means God in His infinite forms with infinite capacity. In the subtle body everyone has enormous capacity. It is in the physical that we do not have capacity. These three bodies are like three rungs of a ladder. The third rung, the physical, is not receiving what the second rung has to offer. The infinite potentiality from the causal body descends into the subtle. But because the physical is not aspiring, the subtle is not strong enough to give this capacity to the physical. The subtle is more than ready, but if the physical is not aspiring and trying to ascend, if the physical is not making some conscious effort, then there is no meeting place.</p>
<p>How can you feed and develop the physical consciousness? You can develop the consciousness in the physical only through proper self-discipline. Two things comprise your daily life: doing something or not doing something. If something wrong presents itself, don’t do it. If you see something right, do it. In that way your consciousness automatically expands. When you do something wrong, you bind your consciousness. If you are caught by temptation which you cannot overcome right now, try to delay your action for a little while. Delay it until tomorrow. Then, when tomorrow comes, delay it until the day after tomorrow. In this way keep on putting off the wrong action. In the meantime you will be doing many good things, and on the strength of these deeds you will be increasing the number of soldiers in your divine army. Then it will be easy for you to overcome temptation. In this way, the consciousness in the physical can be developed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessarily so. This is one theory, and it has a kind of truth. But many times the imperfection starts in the physical body itself with no prior connecting link in the subtle body. The gross physical body is not aspiring, and there is some imperfection in it: so it gets diseases.</p>
<p>When a disease attacks the subtle body before coming to the physical, and the person is aware of it, then he has time to fight and prevent it from entering the physical body. But if it attacks the physical directly, then the victim has almost no time to prevent its entrance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — Hatha Yoga (postures) and physical fitness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — Hatha Yoga (postures) and physical fitness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Is Hatha Yoga necessary in concentration, meditation and contemplation? Is it indispensable for realising God?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If your body is not strong enough, then today you will suffer from a stomach-ache, tomorrow you will have a headache and the next day you will have some other disorder. Naturally, you will not be able to concentrate and meditate. For that reason it is important to keep the body fit. And Hatha Yoga <em>asanas</em> are far better for the body than the vigorous exercises that are done in the West. <em>Asanas</em> will soothe your body as long as you do not do them too much. If <em>asanas</em> are done too dynamically, they may arouse aggressive feelings. But when you do them correctly, you get a kind, mild, soft vibration.</p>
<p>Hatha Yoga may help us a little bit spiritually, but we have to know where we stand in our spiritual journey. If we are very restless, we can do Hatha Yoga in the beginning to learn to sit calmly and quietly. But if we are not constant victims of restlessness, even if we are absolute beginners, Hatha Yoga is not needed, for when we enter into meditation we automatically enter into a calm, quiet state. By doing Hatha Yoga exercises, we feel that we are regulating and disciplining our life. But when we meditate properly and life-energy enters into us from our meditation, automatically our life is disciplined. The divine Peace and Light which we need, we can never, never get from Hatha Yoga.</p>
<p>Just as Yoga exercises will bring calm and quiet, breathing exercises will bring poise. This is not real inner peace, though. It is only a temporary poise. Concentration, meditation and contemplation are the only things that bring real peace.</p>
<p>If your aim is just to keep the body relaxed and fit, then Hatha Yoga will certainly help you. But if you want to complete your course in the inner life, you have to enter into the school of concentration, meditation and contemplation. Hatha Yoga is like kindergarten, whereas your aim is to get a Master’s degree. There are many excellent students who have not gone to kindergarten. They have skipped it and gone directly to primary school, and from there they have gone on to high school and university studies.</p>
<p>In India there are hundreds and thousands of real aspirants who have never done any exercises. I happened to be in an ashram where I did physical exercises for the sake of the body, but even in that ashram the spiritual Master never recommended that the aspirants practise <em>asanas</em> in order to make spiritual progress. In many spiritual communities in India <em>asanas</em> are never done. The seekers start directly with aspiration and meditation.</p>
<p>If one feels that by becoming an expert in Hatha Yoga he can realise God, or make fast progress on the road to realisation, then I wish to say that he is mistaken. There are many people on earth who do physical exercise and keep their bodies extremely fit. There are wrestlers and acrobats and athletes who are very strong and healthy, but God-realisation is not meant for them in this incarnation. They are strong physically, but they do not care for spiritual strength. Fortunately or unfortunately, there is no direct relationship between physical strength and spiritual strength or capacity. Any Indian village has hundreds of little boys who will give a far better performance of Hatha Yoga than the swamis here can do. Nature has taught them; Mother India has taught them. But God-realisation for those village boys will long remain a far cry.</p>
<p>We have to know what we actually want. Hatha Yoga has something to offer which is very limited, and meditation has something to offer which is absolutely unlimited. If you say, “Let me achieve the limited thing first and then grow into the unlimited,” that is all right. Again, if you have the capacity and willingness to enter directly into the vast ocean, God will not ask you to swim in a swimming pool. But if you do not have the capacity to jump directly into the ocean, then God says, “Go to the swimming pool and enjoy yourself for a while.”</p>
<p>My Yoga will not say anything against Hatha Yoga but, at the same time, my Yoga feels that inner strength will also supply the outer strength. That is to say, if I really love God, my eternal Father will take care of the needs of my body. He will give me a sufficiently strong body to enable me to carry on my inner work. If I am ready to sacrifice myself or offer something to my Beloved, my Father, then He will naturally think of my body’s needs; for He knows that if I do not have the physical capacity, I will not be able to fulfil Him as a divine instrument and work for Him on earth.</p>
<p>So if you want to do <em>asanas</em> for five or ten minutes daily to keep your body fit, you can do so. But if you want to do Hatha Yoga for two hours before you meditate, it will be a sheer waste of time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the importance of physical fitness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the importance of physical fitness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With our soul’s aspiration and our inner dedication and surrender, we will be able to reach the Supreme Truth. After we realise the Supreme, we have to fulfil the Supreme by manifesting Him on earth. But in order to manifest the Supreme, the Highest, on earth, physical fitness is absolutely necessary. If we want to reveal and manifest Him, the body must be our divine instrument. If the physical is not fit, manifestation cannot take place at all, or it can take place only to a very limited extent. For that reason we have to pay some attention to sports and exercise. Otherwise, we shall be weak and sick all the time. That does not mean that we must be the world’s fastest runners or best athletes. But we must keep the body fit, according to the necessity of our inner development.</p>
<p>The body needs proper training so that it will be fit to receive the message of the soul. If the body is strong and healthy, it can receive the message of the soul unreservedly, and we can become a perfect receptacle, a perfect instrument. At that time the soul’s aspiration and the body’s aspiration go together.</p>
<p>So please exercise regularly. Your strong body will someday be necessary for the manifestation of the Supreme. The higher, the deeper you go, the more it will be necessary for you to reveal and manifest your inner divinity; and for that manifestation, physical fitness is of paramount importance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To some extent it is true that in the West there is great tension, and that Westerners need peace of mind. But in the East, especially in India, there is tremendous poverty, and this poverty also creates anxiety, worries, tension and turmoil.</p>
<p><em>Asanas</em> do help the body to relax. They are a very good way to keep the body limber and in good condition. But if you expect to get peace of mind by relaxing the body, you will be disappointed. The relaxation that you get from <em>asanas</em> is not real peace. If you want to get infinite Peace, eternal Peace, or a change in your inner consciousness, <em>asanas</em> cannot help you significantly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you want to meditate as well as do Hatha Yoga, should you meditate before doing the exercises?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you want to meditate as well as do Hatha Yoga, should you meditate before doing the exercises?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you do Hatha Yoga exercises, it is better to do them before your meditation. After the Hatha Yoga exercises please rest for about fifteen minutes, lying down, and then meditate. But if you do Hatha Yoga exercises, please do not do more than five or six each day. Those who are meditating daily should not spend more than half an hour or so in Hatha Yoga. Every day you can do some basic exercises and some different ones, but do not go on for more than half an hour. If you do Hatha Yoga exercises for an hour and a half and then want to meditate, it will be extremely difficult for you to enter into meditation.</p>
