  <h2 id="page-title">Humility</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Humility" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God in His highest and in His deepest quality is humility. If we ask why God is so great, the immediate answer is that God is great just because He is soulfully humble. God is omniscient and omnipotent, but all His divine qualities are housed in one divine quality of His, and that is His humility. If God had only played the part of the omnipotent God, then we would have made little progress by this time. But He comes to us as a sincere beggar in all humility just to awaken us from our self-chosen sleep.</p>
<p>One who knows the meaning of humility is truly divine. Humility is not a sign of cowardice. Humility does not mean false modesty. Humility is true divinity. It is the inner being that sustains, supports, guides, moulds and shapes us, but it does so with all humility. The inner being sees us through the eyes of constant humility. Very rarely do we see the inner being, but when we do see the inner being, we see it with pride of vanity.</p>
<p>The mother loves her child with affection and compassion. But if the mother goes one step beyond this love and compassion, then she feels in the child the presence of the divine. At that time she is all humility. She feels that it is the greatest honour to feed the child, to run with the child, to bring up the child, for in him she sees and feels God Himself.</p>
<p>It is through humility that we can dive the deepest and climb the highest in our meditation. The easiest way to enter into the universal Consciousness during our day-to-day activities is through humility. When we show humility, we immediately enter into the universal Consciousness, which is all-humility. In humility is oneness, and in oneness is our divine Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Infinity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Infinity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We feel that infinity is something beyond our reach when we try to grasp it with our mind. When the mind starts its journey, it feels that one millimetre is Infinity, one centimetre is Infinity, a few inches are Infinity. Then after it makes a little progress, it feels that one metre or a few miles is Infinity. The very function of the mind is to see the truth of Infinity in a limited way. But when we aspire, we see the truth not with the mind but with the soul. The soul not only sees Infinity but also feels Infinity as its very own.</p>
<p>With these two naked eyes we cannot see Infinity. But with our third eye we can see Infinity as easily as we can see a human being right in front of us. When the third eye sees Infinity, it does not see Infinity as something other than itself.</p>
<p>In our spiritual life, we can see Infinity if we feel that Infinity is not something foreign to us. In our inner self, in our heart where God dwells, we can possess Infinity. We belong to Infinity and Infinity belongs to us. In the inner world we are bound to feel Infinity and to grow into Infinity. It is not only possible and practicable, but inevitable.</p>

<p>When we use God as our instrument, He is happy because He knows that we are doing the right thing. When we use God, God is happy because He feels that His son has wisdom and knows whom he can utilise. But when God uses us, we misunderstand. We feel that He is trying to lord it over us. Our life of aspiration is living proof of God's acceptance of us as chosen instruments.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Karma</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Karma" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Karma is a Sanskrit word meaning action. In the philosophy of the Lord Buddha, the law of karma has its most significant role. In all spiritual paths we must accept the law of karma to some extent. At present, the law of karma is essential because people are still wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance. But when we enter seriously and completely into the sea of spirituality, the law of karma does not always apply.</p>
<p>"As you sow, so you reap" — this is what the law of karma tells us. But who has inspired us to sow? If an undivine force has inspired us, then naturally we shall reap something harmful and destructive. But if we can run towards the highest force, the Supreme, after committing a wrong action, immediately He will come to our rescue. A child does something wrong, but he runs immediately to his father to escape punishment for his deed. He knows that his father can protect him because his father is most powerful.</p>
<p>The past has not given us what we want, so why should we look back? If we think of yesterday as karma, then we will take today as the result. But if today's result is not satisfactory then we must change our outlook. We must take today as karma and tomorrow as the result. Yesterday we were unconscious, undivine, animal; today we have become divinely conscious and aspiring. So naturally, as the result of our karma, tomorrow's golden dawn will be fulfilling.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, if an aspirant has already made an inner connection with a great spiritual Master, then most of his wrong actions will be nullified by the infinite Grace of the Supreme. At the same time, most of his divine karmic actions will bear fruit sooner than at once. This is because the Master can unite the aspiration of the seeker with the divine Grace, which is the omnipotent power of the Supreme. If there is no intermediary factor, no spiritual Master, then in spite of doing a good, divine thing, the aspirant will have to wait the full time for the result of his action to take place. Today we sow, and then we have to wait for the harvest. But if the Inner Pilot is consciously aspiring inside us and we are conscious of the Inner Pilot, then we will see that our divine karma will bear fruit immediately.</p>

<p>When liberation is achieved in the entire being, first the heart tastes Bliss, then the mind, then the vital, then finally the gross physical. Liberation means our conscious return to the sea of Peace and Bliss. Liberation itself is Bliss. In liberation we feel that life is a constant realisation and manifestation of the Bliss of the Infinite.</p>

<p>The very function of spiritual light is to illumine and transform our darkness. Spiritual light, inner light, illumines our agelong imperfections and bondage.</p>
<p>Outer light is knowledge; inner light is realisation. With our outer light we want to go toward God. With our inner light we see and feel that we don't have to go <em>toward</em> God because we already are <em>in</em> God and God is already in us; we see and feel that God is our highest and most illumined part. With our outer light we feel God is a Goal to be realised. With our inner light we feel that not only is God our own, but God is the essence and substance of our own reality.</p>
<p>Without light, nothing can be accomplished in the spiritual life. With light, everything can be accomplished. In light everything is already accomplished.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">One-Pointed Consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="One-Pointed Consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One-pointed consciousness is the manifestation of one-pointed will. One-pointed will is the manifestation of God's one-pointed Concern. One-pointed Concern is God's unconditional and unreserved Compassion. When God's Compassion descends to the bottom rung of the ladder, we see God's oneness with the obscure, impure, undivine, unaspiring humanity.</p>
<p>One-pointed consciousness means our total surrender to the Will of God. One-pointed consciousness can be achieved through aspiration, constant inner strength, inner will and inner poise. One-pointed consciousness we can get only when we expect nothing from the outer world and everything from God. If God wants, He can give us His inner wealth Himself or He can give it to us through another seeker whom He uses as His instrument. But no human being in and of himself can fulfil us; only the divinity within can fulfil us.</p>

<p>Patience is divine strength. Very often ordinary people do not know the meaning of patience. They feel that it is something feminine, a form of cowardice or a reluctant way of accepting the truth. They feel that because there is no other way left, we have to be patient. But if consciously we can be patient, then we are strengthening our inner will and lengthening the scope of our divine manifestation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Peace</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Peace" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Before one enters into the spiritual life, one sings or cries,</p>

<p>A sea of peace and joy and light<br /> Beyond my reach I know.<br /> In me the storm-tossed weeping night<br /> Finds room to rage and flow.</p>

<p>An ordinary person feels that a sea of peace is beyond his reach. But this sea of peace is at his command if he enters and continues to practise the spiritual life. The foundation stone of the spiritual life is peace. In the spiritual life we achieve peace only when we knock at God's Door. If we knock at the door of a human being, then we shall never achieve peace. At every moment we have to feel that we can get peace only from God.</p>
<p>The life of peace is the result of a life of our unconditional dedication to the Will of the Supreme. If we do not expect anything from the world, either good or bad, then we will have peace in our entire being.</p>
<p>Peace is man's greatest and highest blessing. Man thinks that he can get everything with prosperity; but if he is wanting in peace, then he is the worst possible beggar. We say "peace of mind," but actually we do not have peace in the mind. By staying in the mind, we can never have even a glimpse of peace. When we want peace, we have to go beyond the realm of the mind. How can we go beyond the mind? It is through our constant aspiration. That aspiration will enable us to collect the mind like a bundle and throw it into the sea of the heart. Then we will see that our mind, vital and physical — our whole existence — will be inundated with inner peace.</p>
<p>God has all divine qualities, but His most cherished divine quality is peace. God's inner wealth and peace can never be separated. In peace we see His satisfaction, we feel His own worth and we realise His ultimate, self-fulfilling and self-manifesting Goal.</p>

<p>The personal God and impersonal God are both the same God. The personal God will come to you with a body. You will be able to see His arms, His eyes, His nose and everything. He will be most luminous, infinitely more beautiful than the most beautiful human being on earth. This is God in His personal aspect.</p>
<p>The impersonal aspect of God is His infinite Energy, infinite Light, infinite Power. A man stands in front of you; he is personal. But the moment he shows you his power or his capacity in any form, that aspect is impersonal. The figure that stands in front of you is personal; but the manifestation of his power or capacity is his impersonal aspect. When he houses his capacity, his potentiality, his power, his light, at that time he is personal. But when he expresses his potentiality, this expression is impersonal. God is both personal and impersonal. He has form and He is without form but, at the same time, He transcends both form and formlessness.</p>

<p>Prayer and meditation must go together. When we pray we ask God to be responsible for us, and when we meditate we consciously accept responsibility for God. When we pray, we offer God our responsibilities; we give our helpless, hopeless, useless existence to God. When we meditate, we become like lions: we become divine, devoted instruments of God. At that time we take upon ourselves God's responsibilities. One moment we give our existence to God because we are helpless; the next moment we ask God if we can do something for Him. Prayer takes us up to God and God fulfils us. Meditation brings God down to us and then we fulfil God. The two should go together.</p>

<p>The physical reality is almost a dream. The spiritual reality is Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. If you concentrate daily on truth, you will feel your oneness with your own reality. This is your real life. And what is your own Reality, the ultimate Reality? The ultimate Reality is the fulfilled and manifested divinity that humanity will one day become.</p>

<p>Today's realisation is tomorrow's revelation. What is revelation? Revelation is manifested realisation. What is realisation? Realisation is tomorrow's fulfilled manifestation. God has revealed Himself in you and through you. Now you have to reveal God in and through your totally surrendered and dedicated life.</p>
