<p>Silence, silence.<br />Silence is our aspiration-plant.<br />Silence is our realisation-tree.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.<br />Silence transcends our mind-seed.<br />Silence transcends our thought-fruit.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.<br />On earth, silence speaks most eloquently. In Heaven, silence acts most powerfully. In God, silence lives most fruitfully.<br />Silence is the illumination of our earth-bound greatness. Silence is the illumination of our heaven-free goodness.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.<br />Silence is the world-teacher yet unappreciated. Silence is the world-student yet unrecognised.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.<br />Silence is at once the beauty of the universal creation and the duty of the transcendental Creator.</p>
<p>Silence, silence.<br />Silence is man’s ascendence in God, for God. Silence is God’s transcendence in man, for man.</p>

<p>I wish to offer my heart’s deepest gratitude to the professor of Eastern philosophy who has so kindly given me the opportunity to be of service to the students and seekers of his school. Nothing gives me greater joy, nothing has greater value in my life than to be of dedicated service to those who love the truth and who need the truth.</p>
<p>I wish to give a very, very short talk on philosophy, religion and Yoga.</p>
<p>Your professor has told me that you are studying Eastern philosophy. Here I think it will be appropriate on my part to invoke the presence of the Lord Buddha, to bring down peace, light and bliss in abundant measure. The main reason is that your teacher is, I understand, a follower of the Lord Buddha. So, with your most kind permission, I would like to recite the most soulful and fruitful chant for the followers of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy chants:]</p>

<p><em>Buddham sharanam gacchami</em><br /><em>Dhammam sharanam gacchami</em><br /><em>Sangham sharanam gacchami</em></p>
<p>I go to the Buddha for refuge.<br /> I go to the <em>Dharma</em> for refuge.<br /> I go to the Order for refuge.</p>

<p>Philosophy sees the truth. Religion feels the Truth. Yoga becomes the Truth. God-Perfection is the Truth.</p>
<p>Philosophy is in the searching mind. Religion is in the loving heart. Yoga is in the aspiring entire being.</p>
<p>A real philosophy teacher teaches the outer world. A real religion teacher loves the inner world. A real Yoga teacher discovers his inseparable oneness with both the inner world and the outer world.</p>

<p>The inner world achieves.<br /> The outer world reveals.<br /> The inner world achieves God-Height.<br /> The outer world reveals God-Depth.<br /> God-Height is soulfully beautiful.<br /> God-Depth is beautifully soulful.</p>

<p>When a seeker becomes soulfully beautiful, he embodies the cry of continuous self-transcendence. When a seeker becomes beautifully soulful, he reveals constantly the smile of self-transformation and self-perfection.</p>
<p>The human philosophy ignores the animal in us and belittles the human in us. The divine philosophy accepts the challenges of life, braves the buffets of life and finally, offers life a conscious awareness of the purpose of life.</p>
<p>Human religion is the song of the unfulfilling and unfulfilled many and the marked and isolated many. Divine religion is the dance of the liberating and liberated, fulfilling and fulfilled One in the aspiring many and of the many in the immortalising and immortal One.</p>
<p>The human Yoga needs God because God is great, absolutely great and because He is powerful, eternally powerful. The divine Yoga needs God because God is good, in the sound life of the finite and in the silence-life of the Infinite.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The outer power, the inner power</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The outer power, the inner power" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Each human being on earth embodies the outer power and the inner power. He is aware of his outer power when he looks without, around himself. He is conscious of his inner power when he dives deep within.</p>
<p>Each human being is the outer power and the inner power. When he calls himself the head and the body-consciousness, nothing more and nothing else, then he is the outer power. When he calls himself the soul, the soul-light, then he is the inner power.</p>
<p>The body-consciousness has light of its own. The soul-consciousness has light of its own. The body-consciousness, because of its limitations, does not see far. For the body-consciousness the future always remains a far cry. The soul-consciousness, because of its unlimited capacity, at one and the same time sees, grows into and becomes the achievements of the past, the realisations of the present and the vision-dreams of the future.</p>
<p>The outer power blinds the human in us. The outer power is devoured by the animal in us. The inner power clears and expands our vision; it shows our vision the way to reach the highest transcendental Goal.</p>
<p>The outer power is competition: conscious and constant competition. The inner power is conscious conception: conception of its own worth, its own reality and divinity. Divinity proceeds and succeeds, succeeds and proceeds. Reality eternally is. Again, in its silence-life, reality is at once the transcendental Height and the immanence-Light.</p>
<p>The outer power is supremacy. The inner power is accuracy: accuracy stating the fact of what it has and what it is. What it has is the source and what it is, is the manifestation of the source.</p>
<p>The outer power sings with imagination, dances with temptation, dies in frustration. The inner power is concentration, meditation and contemplation. Concentration accepts the challenges of life. Meditation purifies and illumines the challenges of life. Contemplation transforms the challenges of life into golden opportunities in life for the inner being, the Inner Pilot in us. The outer power wants to strike and then immediately wants to escape. The inner power wants not only to embrace the world but also to convince the world that the world’s existence and its own existence are eternally inseparable.</p>
<p>The outer power says to the inner power, “Look what I have. I have the capacity to destroy God’s entire creation.” The inner power says to the outer power, “Look what I have. I have the power to illumine God’s entire creation.”</p>
<p>The outer power is at times afraid of its own creation: the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb. The inner power is constantly feeding its creation with love-light, concern-light and perfection-light.</p>
<p>The outer power feels that there is a height which has to be transcended and that if this goal is achieved, then satisfaction will dawn. The inner power feels that height and depth, the foot of the mountain and the top of the mountain, are all at one place. It sees that they are singing the song of one reality, that they are all inside the cosmic Heart in perfect union, enjoying inseparable oneness.</p>
<p>The outer power wants only to ascend. It is afraid of descending. The inner power wants to ascend and descend. It knows perfectly well that when it is descending, it is carrying down to earth the descending God; and when it is ascending, it is carrying up to Heaven the ascending God.</p>
<p>The outer power is the dance of sound. The inner power is the song of silence. The life of sound is the creation of the human in us. The life of silence is the creation of the divine in us. The human in us wants to prove its existence. It feels that unless and until it can prove its existence, the world will have no respect for us, the world will not care for us. The divine in us does not want to prove its existence for world-acceptance, world-appreciation and world-admiration. The divine in us feels that its existence is God’s universal existence. God is experiencing His own ascending, descending and transcending Light in the divine in us.</p>
<p>The outer power is the human power. The inner power is the divine power. The outer power says, “I can do. I need no help, no assistance.” The inner power says, “I can do nothing and I am nothing. At the same time, I can do everything because there is someone in me, the Inner Pilot, who will do everything for me.” Furthermore, it says that the Inner Pilot has already done everything for us and that we only have to be aware of this.</p>
<p>When we live in the desire-world, the outer power lords it over us. The desire-world is the world of possession and frustration. When we live in the aspiration-world, the inner power illumines us and fulfils us. The desire-world is the world without. The aspiration-world is the world within. Realisation has a free access to the inner world. And what is realisation? Realisation is the acceptance of reality as it is, reality at its present stage of evolution and reality at its ultimate height. Realisation tells us that the animal in us is for transformation, the human in us is for perfection, the divine in us is for manifestation.</p>

<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is Eternity’s fastest speed.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is Eternity’s fastest speed-communion between man and God.</p>

<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is sound-mission. It is God the Supreme Lover’s Sound-Mission.</p>
<p>What is aspiration? Aspiration is the crying man’s duty. Aspiration is the smiling God’s Beauty. Aspiration is God’s constant declaration of man’s capacity. Aspiration is man’s conscious necessity of God’s real Reality within and without him.</p>
<p>Aspiration is not and cannot be the destination. Aspiration is the eternal journey. It is man’s eternal journey to self-transcendence in the soul-light of perfection.</p>
<p>Aspiration is God’s eternal journey of supreme manifestation in the satisfaction-heart of His transcendental Height, universal Length and unfathomable Depth.</p>
<p>With aspiration God started His journey. With aspiration He asks His children, His creation, to continue the journey.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Patience</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Patience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Patience is our unrecognised capacity; patience is our unrecognised achievement. Capacity succeeds; achievement proceeds.</p>
<p>Physical power, vital power and mental power are no match for patience-power. When physical power is misused against someone, the patience-power of that person will eventually triumph. In the outer life and the inner life, the victim will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>Human power is nothing short of animal power, destructive power, if we do not aspire, if we do not long for truth, light and beauty. Patience is our soul’s light. This light is always unconditional.</p>
<p>Here on the physical plane we notice patience in the mother and in the father. The mother’s compassion-light is patience; the mother’s concern-light is patience. The father’s wisdom-power is patience in his son. The father’s wisdom-power, his all-seeing wisdom for his son, is patience.</p>
<p>God created this world. In His creation vast He considers only one person as His friend: Patience. God and His Patience are inseparable.</p>
<p>God’s creation is not complete; perfection is still a far cry. God with His infinite Patience-Light aspires in and through each creation of His. God feels that His Patience-Light is a divine, magic power that can undo the past and transform it into the golden future.</p>
<p>There is nothing on earth that can undo the past but patience. If we have patience we can easily undo the past. The past is a morning mist, a meaningless experience in comparison to our future realisation. The past brought us the message of suffering, sorrow, weakness, limitation, bondage and death. Again, the soul’s light, which is patience, will eventually conquer delusion, illusion, temptation, limitation, everything undivine. God’s Patience-Light will conquer everything in and through us.</p>
<p>Man needs patience in order to discover what he truly is and God needs patience in order to make man feel not only that he is God’s son, God’s dearest creation, but that he is exactly the same as God. Man has to realise what he eternally is: God Himself. Man is now God veiled; with patience-light man will unveil his inner divinity. Man is God yet to be consciously and constantly realised and God is man yet to be manifested totally, completely and unmistakably here on earth.</p>
<p>Deliberately and consciously man claims something as his own which is not actually his: ignorance. But there is only one thing that man can claim as his own: God, nothing less and nothing else. Unless and until man comes to realise this, he will never know who he is. Man is divinity’s reality. This is the only thing that he has to discover: his real reality which is dormant within him.</p>
<p>When he is in the desire-life, each man should realise that in him there is God-seed. That God-seed is going to germinate eventually into a plant, and from a plant it will grow into a banyan tree. Again, when the same person enters into the spiritual life, he has to feel that the fruit, the eternal fruit, is already there just for him to eat. In the desire-world he has to discover God the seed so that he can grow and grow in aspiration. In the aspiration-world he has to discover God the fruit so that he can recognise what he eternally is.</p>
<p>Patience is our revealing and revealed faith in God, the Supreme Pilot, and our revealed and revealing faith in our own existence. Patience is our faith in our own discovery that we are not only of God but also for God.</p>
<p>The human cry that climbs up from the inmost recesses of our heart makes friends with patience in order to see the smiling face of Heaven and the Eternal Pilot. Again, the Eternal Pilot makes friends with patience so that one day He can see here in humanity’s cry the perfect liberation, everlasting salvation, complete illumination and total transformation of humanity.</p>

<p>Every day, early in the morning, stand in front of the mirror. If you dare to stand in front of the mirror, then you can easily stand in front of the whole world. Now, when you stand in front of the mirror, if you see an undivine face looking back at you, then rest assured that the whole world is undivine. But if you are getting joy from your face, if it is pure and divine, then rest assured that the world is also pure and divine. According to the way you see yourself, the rest of the world will present itself to you. If you see aspiration in your face, I assure you this aspiration you are bound to notice in the whole world. If you see aggressive forces, a devouring tiger inside you, then when you leave the house a big tiger will come and devour you. We are exact prototypes of the world. We are like a microcosm and the world is the macrocosm. A saint always sees everyone in the world — even the worst possible thief — as a saint. Similarly, a thief will see even the most divine saint as a thief. We judge others according to our own standard, according to our own realisation. A thief will think a saint is a thief and a saint will think a thief is a saint. Those who have not realised God will always suspect and doubt those who have. Everyone has to judge others according to his own standard of realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Action</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Action" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Let us not think before we act, for each thought is a heavy burden, a heavy pressure on our shoulders. This burden and pressure weakens our life-energy considerably.</p>
<p>Let us silence the mind before we act. If we silence the mind, if we know the art of silencing the mind, then we can not only accomplish our tasks faster than otherwise, but we can do hundreds of things at the same time in a fleeting minute.</p>
<p>Let us not talk before we act, for talk does nothing but bind us to action. And I really want to add, we have to be free within and without so that with each action we can breathe in the fresh air of perfecting, perfected and perfect action.</p>
<p>Let us pray before we act. Each prayer is our soulful devotion, and this devotion is our self-illumining life in action.</p>
<p>Let us not decide before we act. Each decision will be challenged and will be devoured by hesitation. Let us act spontaneously, for each spontaneous action is the expression of our expanding consciousness, the result of our heart’s preconceived ideals, the result of our life’s preconceived light and the result of our soul’s preconceived goal. Action is perfect when it is of God-inspiration and for God-manifestation.</p>
<p>Each desire-action makes us feel how weak, how ignorant, how hopeless, how helpless and how useless we are. Each aspiration-action makes us feel how strong, how powerful, how soulful, how meaningful and how fruitful we are. Again, action for action’s sake is not and cannot be the right thing. Action has to be for God’s sake.</p>
<p>Before the birth of action, inspiration is our guide. During the course of action, aspiration is our guide. At the end of action, our surrendering height and surrendered depth is our satisfaction and God’s satisfaction.</p>
<p>Imagination tells action, “Run forward, dive deep within, fly above.” Aspiration tells action, “God-Height has not to remain and cannot remain always a far cry. God-Height is our birthright; it is within us. We have only to discover it. And when we discover it, we feel that God-Height does not only belong to us but we belong to it.”</p>
<p>Perfection-satisfaction tells us that each individual is not only a direct representative of God on earth, but God Himself in the process of making and shaping His own Vision-Reality yet unfulfilled and His own Reality-Vision yet to be fully manifested.</p>
<p>Each action is God’s Song here on earth for God-manifestation and there in Heaven for God-satisfaction. Each action on earth is God’s Dance for humanity’s eternal progress and eternal self-transcendence. Each action in Heaven is God’s satisfaction in divinity’s self-awakening and self-illumination for a new universe; each action in Heaven is a new creation and the constant fulfilment of anever-growing, ever-glowing, ever-satisfying and ever-satisfied God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Human art, divine art, supreme art</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Human art, divine art, supreme art" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>First see it and then do it: this is human art. First feel it and then do it: this is divine art.</p>
<p>First see it and then draw it: this is human art. First feel it and then draw it: this is divine art. First live in the inner world with your capacity-light and then live for the outer world’s necessity-life: this is supreme art.</p>
<p>Calculation of earth’s beauty is human art. Liberation of earth’s beauty is divine art. Perfection of earth’s beauty is supreme art.</p>
<p>Human art declares, “Nothing succeeds like success.” Divine art affirms, “Nothing proceeds like progress.” Supreme art whispers, “Nothing satisfies like service, divine service, soulful service.”</p>
<p>The lofty height of human art is the inspiration-moon. The sublime depth of divine art is the aspiration-sun. The illumining goal of supreme art is Eternity’s perfection-day.</p>
<p>Beauty’s possession is human art, the art of earth. Beauty’s distribution is Heaven’s art. Beauty’s satisfaction is supreme art.</p>
<p>Earth’s possession of beauty is earth’s art. Heaven’s compassion for beauty is Heaven’s art. God’s Perfection in beauty is supreme art.</p>
<p>Human art looks around while running towards the goal. Divine art looks ahead while running fast, faster, fastest towards the goal. Supreme art does not run, does not fly, does not dive; supreme art becomes what the Inner Pilot, the Supreme Artist, wants it to become.</p>
<p>Human art is the reality that we have, the reality that needs its expression, the reality that needs world-acceptance, world-appreciation, world-admiration, world-adoration. Divine art is the divinity that we see in the inner world and the outer world — in the world of our earthly experiences, earthly realisations, earthly sacrifices and earthly achievements. Supreme art is the divine reality that is constantly transcending its own height for God’s ever-new creation, ever-new revelation, ever-new manifestation and ever-new perfection.</p>
<p>Human art is the leaf-experience of our life-tree. Divine art is the flower-realisation of our life-tree. Supreme art is the fruit-perfection of our life-tree.</p>
<p>A leaf inspires us: therefore, we run towards our destination. A flower purifies us; therefore, our speed becomes tremendous and we run fast, faster, fastest. A fruit energises us; therefore, we become chosen instruments to fight against teeming darkness and ignorance, to conquer the undivine forces within us and finally, to establish in ourselves the real, the divine, the eternal silence-life and eternal perfection-beauty.</p>
<p>Each creation of God has the real in it. This real reality is the soul. Now, the soul of a bench or a chair need not and cannot be as developed, as illumining, as fulfilling as the soul of an advanced seeker or a realised Master. So if we want to draw a bench or a chair, we may draw it well; but our inspiration is bound to fail us after a few minutes when we try to draw a chair, a bench or a table. But if we draw something or someone that has contributed considerably to the world of aspiration and light, then naturally our inspiration will last a long, long time. In this case, inspiration is the precursor of aspiration, aspiration is the precursor of revelation and revelation is the precursor of manifestation, which is none other than God-perfection: complete, absolute perfection.</p>
<p>The human artist is great, undoubtedly great. The divine artist is good, unmistakably good. The supreme artist is he who cares neither for greatness nor for goodness, who longs for only one thing: God-satisfaction, the satisfaction of God the Supreme Artist in and through him. He doesn’t need greatness, he doesn’t need goodness; he only longs for God-satisfaction in his life.</p>
