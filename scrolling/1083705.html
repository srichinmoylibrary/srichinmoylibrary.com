<h2>God the Supreme Musician</h2>

<p>God the Musician knows that music is spirituality, music is Immortality. Man the musician thinks that music is sensuality, music is mortality.</p>
<p>God the Musician knows that His Music is His transcendental Self-communion. Man the musician thinks that his music is his world's lifelong companion.</p>
<p>God the Musician is divinely and eternally mysterious. Man the musician is humanly and temporarily marvellous.</p>
<p>God's Music tells us that music is the realisation of the universal Soul. Man's music tells us that music is the aspiration of the individual soul.</p>
<p>God's Music runs from the height to the depth. Man's music runs from the breadth to the length. At its height, God's Music is His Vision. In its depth, God's Music is His Realm. In its breadth, man's music is his crying soul. In its length, man's music is his victory's goal.</p>
<p>God's Music is the constant expansion of His Soul's Delight. Man's music is the preparation of his life's hunger for perpetual joy.</p>
<p>God's Music kills God with its infinite luminosity. Man's music kills man with its undying curiosity.</p>
<p>Music in the unlit body is destruction. Music in the unlit vital is passion. Music in the unlit mind is confusion. Music in the unlit heart is frustration.</p>
<p>Music in the aspiring body is creation. Music in the aspiring vital is purification. Music in the aspiring mind is liberation. Music in the aspiring heart is revelation.</p>
<p>My God the Supreme Musician has two families. One is in the East, the other is in the West. God tells His Eastern children, or more precisely, His Indian children, that music is the soul's purity. God tells His Western children that music is life's beauty. God tells His Eastern children that music is the fulfilling rest at the bottom of the life-sea. God tells His Western children that music is the dance of the multitudinous waves of the life-sea.</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, those among you who can walk will walk, those who can march will march and those who can run will run towards their destined goal." God tells His Western children: "My children, I want you all to stay together. I want you all to run together towards your destined goal."</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, what you have is a one-pointed and unbroken chain of unity. That is good." He tells His Western children: "My children, what you have is unity in diversity. That is great."</p>
<p>God tells His Eastern children: "My children, what you have is your dream's poetry, what you have is your reality's literature." He tells His Western children: "My children, what you have is your dream's arithmetic, what you have is your reality's mathematics."</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers, seekers of the infinite Truth. Some of you are consumed with the desire to arouse and awaken your Kundalini so that you can acquire occult powers and perform miracles. But I wish to tell you that you do not have to practise any specific spiritual discipline in order to awaken your Kundalini. Beethoven is a striking example. He was a genuine seeker and his soulful music of the other world awakened his Kundalini. You also try with your own soul's music. I assure you that you, too, will succeed.</p>
<p>What Beethoven says on music is true not only from the intellectual and emotional point of view, but also from the spiritual point of view:</p>
<p>"Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life. Although the spirit be not master of that which it creates through music, yet it is blessed in this creation, which, like every creation of art, is mightier than the artist."</p>
<p>Music is the Vedic bird in us. This bird is called Suparna. This bird divine flies in the welkin of Infinity, through Eternity, with the message of Immortality.</p>
<p>Here on earth we do notice that birds have the capacity to sing in endless measure, whereas we human beings try to create or develop this capacity. Tagore defends us:</p>
<p>"To the birds you gave songs, the birds gave you songs in return. You gave me only a voice, yet asked for more, and I sing."</p>
<p>The poet-bird in Keats, divinely intoxicated, flies in front of me, before my ken.</p>
<p>"Was it a vision, or a waking dream? Fled is that music:-Do I wake or sleep?"</p>
<p>The music-bird is within us to stay, to give us love. The music-bird is without us to fly, to give us joy.</p>
<p>Since music is a universal language, it has no need to express itself in any particular language of the world. Rabindranath Tagore says:</p>
<p>"Music is the purest form of art and, therefore, the most direct expression of beauty, with form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the Infinite in the finite forms of creation is music itself, silent and visible."</p>
<p>Our body's food is either vegetable or meat, or both. But our soul's food is music. Undoubtedly it is so. Even our physical nature at times desperately needs music.</p>
<p>What Bovee says is undeniably true:</p>
<p>"Music is the fourth great material want of our nature-first food, then raiment, then shelter, then music."</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, next to meditation is music, the breath of music. Meditation is silence, energising and fulfilling. Silence is the eloquent expression of the inexpressible. Aldous Huxley says:</p>
<p>"After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."</p>
<p>They say, "Music is another woman who talks charmingly, but says nothing." I say, "Music is verily the woman who at once tells everything divinely and offers everything unreservedly."</p>
<p>They say, "Classical music is the music without words; modern music is the music without music." I say, "Classical music is the music that lasts after it has all been sung; modern music is the music that begins long before it has actually begun." In classical music we try to see God the eternal Beyond. In modern music we see God the eternal Now.</p>
<p>Music is our soul's home, God is the Supreme Musician. In Sri Krishna, I see God the Supreme Musician. Krishna's flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. He plays on His flute. We listen. We do something more. We barter our body's dust with His Soul's plenitude. To Sri Krishna I bow, we bow.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Vital music and spiritual music</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Vital music and spiritual music" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God has created this universe; the universe has come out of God. God will always maintain the world with His inner Music. But His inner Music, His transcendental Music, is unfortunately not the same music that we hear today.</p>
<p>God is the Supreme Musician. The music that God originally created is the music of the soul. He played for the soul and the soul wanted to play for Him. This music from the soul wanted to express and fulfil itself through the heart. But here a problem arose. When the soul started to play its music in the heart, the lower vital and doubting mind did not allow the heart to listen. Then gradually the vital became more powerful than the pure heart.</p>
<p>The music of the vital destroys our subtle nerves. Like a hungry tiger, it wants to devour the heart's divine qualities. Here in this world, when we think of music, the vital immediately comes to the fore. The vital of the world has been to the fore for quite a few years. But lower vital music will not always reign supreme on earth. The world also has soul. Eventually, the music of the soul will replace the music of the vital. Today the vital is nourished and the soul is starving. But when there are more aspiring people than unaspiring people on earth, naturally the inner, soul-elevating music will replace the music of the impure, unlit and obscure vital.</p>
<p>Right now the world may not seem to appreciate spiritual music, but if we continue to create, one day people will appreciate music from a spiritual point of view. Inwardly the world wants to make progress. Outwardly the world wants something new. That which is eternal is outwardly new. On the vital plane and in the physical world, the eternal always seems new. But in the inner plane it is not; there is nothing new in the soul's world. If we see a thing twice in the physical world, we may think it is different each time. If we see our own wristwatch in the morning and again in the evening, if we are in a different consciousness each time, we will feel that it is a totally different watch. But in the inner world, it is not like that. We all know outer music; outer music is very often destructive. But inner music is bound to be soul-stirring and soul-elevating. For God-realisation, inner music is of paramount importance. Again, if outer music is devotional music, if it is something that uplifts the musician's consciousness and spreads pure, unalloyed joy, that music also plays a considerable role.</p>
<p>Inner music one can hear and one can create while one is meditating. Thousands and millions of times at the age of thirteen or fourteen, I used to hear the cosmic gods and goddesses playing music. We can hear inner music through aspiration. What is inner music? We have learned from the Vedas that this music is the mother tongue of humanity, the language of the soul. It is through music that the Divine in us gets the opportunity to manifest itself here on earth.</p>
<p>Spiritual aspirants who have musical capacity can eventually show the world at large that inner music can be played outwardly and appreciated by the world. When artistic capacity is joined with spiritual capacity, the musician can break through the walls that other musicians have created. At that time, outer success will not only be worldly success but also divine success. With guidance from a spiritual Master, a musician's spiritual capacity becomes most powerful. Then it is very easy for the musician to help thousands of people at a time, because they appreciate his music and also see what kind of life he leads. He doesn't have to speak or anything. Others will just look at his face and see the difference between the spiritual life and their own unaspiring life. In this world, inwardly and silently everyone can judge us. Even if we remain silent we can really help.</p>
<p>Music can do much for the Supreme. It is a way to reach humanity and bring spirituality to humanity. The shopkeeper gives something to the customer and the customer appreciates it. Then, when the customer begins to have faith in that particular shopkeeper, the shopkeeper says, "You have appreciated my mango, but now I have something else for you; I have a guava also. This will also satisfy you and nourish you." Because the customer has faith in the shopkeeper, he will taste the new fruit and be satisfied. The time has come for musical people to say, "We can give you something else. It is called spirituality. Try it." When a musician leads a spiritual life, it is very easy for him to help thousands of people at a time, because they appreciate his music and the kind of life he leads. Spiritual Masters can only approach humanity if people come to them with real aspiration, whereas musicians have the means to approach humanity with their art. A musician's biography is written wherever he performs; everybody hears what he is playing. But for spiritual people it is not like that. In the case of spiritual people, their whole biography is written inside, and not all will be able to see it.</p>

<p>When I sing, I am a runner, running and running like an expert runner.<br /> When I compose music, I am a driver, driving and driving like an expert driver.<br /> Running is my life-preparation. Driving is my life-examination.<br /> My life-preparation and my life-examination eventually see the face of God the Supreme Musician.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Silence and music</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Silence and music" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Silence is the source of everything. It is the source of music and it is music itself. Silence is the deepest, most satisfying music of the Supreme. Silence is like a stream that goes to one place and becomes a river, or to another place and becomes a brook, or to the sea where it is totally expanded.</p>
<p>Consciousness will offer us the Music of the Supreme. What is the Music of the Supreme? It is the constant elevation of our consciousness. God-realisation itself is the supreme Music. The meaning of God-realisation is conscious oneness with the rest of the world and with God. Each seeker is one with God, but he is not conscious of it. We use the term 'God' at random. Even an atheist, who does not believe in God, will use the term 'God.'</p>
<p>Where is God? Someone will say He is in Heaven; someone else will say He is somewhere else. One moment He is here; the next moment He is not in our vicinity but is somewhere else. This is our conception of God. But this is wrong. We must feel, "God is where I am." The deeper within we go, the clearer it becomes that it is He who has tied us together and bound us with His inner Oneness. One supreme tune is being played, and this tune is the tune of universal oneness.</p>
<p>God is the Supreme Musician. It is He who is playing with us, on us and in us. We cannot separate God from His music. The universal Consciousness is constantly being played by the Supreme Himself, and is constantly growing into the Supreme Music. God the Creator is the Supreme Musician and God the creation is the supreme Music. The musician and His Music can never be separated. The Musician Supreme is playing his Music Supreme here in the universe. His creation is being fulfilled. The Music Supreme feels its fulfilment only when it consciously becomes one with the Supreme, the Creator Himself.</p>
<p>God's existence and universal music can never be separated. When God spreads His Arms, it is His Music. When He stretches His Legs, it is His Music. When He opens His Eyes, it is all His Music. In His Arms we see the music of Infinity's Benediction; in His Feet we see the music of Eternity's Compassion, and in His Eyes we see the music of Immortality's Illumination. These three-Benediction, Compassion and Illumination make God what He is: Perfection, perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>The difference between a song and a piece of music is this: the song is the rose, the piece of music is the garden. The song is usually of the heart and for the heart. The music is of the entire being and for the entire being.</p>
<p>The excruciating pangs and universal pathos of music is the beauty of the earth-heart.</p>
<p>The transcendental music of liberating Light and immortalising Delight is the beauty of the Heaven-Soul.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Why do we like music?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We like music because it teaches us how to love, whom to love and why to love. How do we love? We love by self-giving. Whom do we love? We love God. Why do we love? We love because the divine lover in us has no existence of his own without feeling his oneness-reality with his Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>Let us not try to understand music with our mind. Let us not even try to feel it with our heart. Let us simply and spontaneously allow the music-bird to fly in out heart-sky. While flying, it will unconditionally reveal to us what it has and what it is. What it has is Immortality's message and what it is is Eternity's passage.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of music: earthly music and Heavenly music. There is also a third type, which is the Music of the Supreme. Earthly music stimulates the vital in us. Heavenly music illumines us and spreads the divinity within us. The Music of the Supreme fulfils the Reality within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Silence is the nest and music is the bird. The bird leaves the nest early in the morning and returns to the nest in the evening. Similarly, in the spiritual world, divine music comes from the inmost soul of Silence.</p>
<p>Ordinary music comes from the vital, from the gross physical consciousness, or from something subtle in our existence. This subtle reality need not be very high or very deep. It may only be an inch deeper than our gross physical.</p>
<p>But when we compare divine music and Silence, we must say that Silence is the all-encompassing nest. All peace, all joy and all confidence are inside that nest and from there the music-bird comes out and flies all over the world. While flying in the firmament, it offers delight to the lovers of music as well as to the Universal Consciousness. The Universal Consciousness is fed constantly by the immortal, divine and supreme Music of the Absolute.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Music is heard by each individual according to his own capacity of receptivity. God plays the same Music, but it will sound one way to one person and totally different to another. When a professor gives a talk, there will be many students in the same classroom. Each student will understand the professor's talk differently. Because of his inner capacity, the best student in the class will understand much more than the worst student in the class. God's Music is heard, valued, understood and felt in a specific way according to the listener's own capacity of receptivity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the Supreme just singing one eternal song?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the Supreme just singing one eternal song?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme has been singing only one song, and that is the song of Perfection. Only that one song gives Him satisfaction, and that one Perfection-song He has been singing eternally. But inside that one song, we have to know that countless songs are being sung. It began with one song, but then it entered into myriad songs. A tree is one. But when we look at the hundreds of leaves and flowers and fruits, we see many. Inside the one we are seeing many. Similarly, there is only one song that the Supreme is singing, and that is the song of Perfection. But inside that song there are many songs, countless songs.</p>
<p>When the Supreme sings, He is not using His Mind; He is not using His Heart. He is using His Vision. According to our vision, when two and two become four, that is perfection. But in God's Vision, two and two may become seven, or anything. God's Vision is not bound by the mind. The mind says, "It is this way; it has to be this way. It is not that way." But the Supreme does not want to be bound.</p>
<p>The Supreme's Freedom is not like a mad elephant. He does not use His Freedom to lord it over the world, as we do. His Freedom is His spontaneous movement, from which He comes to get the highest Delight. In each movement He wants to derive the utmost Delight, which He once upon a time derived while creating His creation. He wants to enjoy Himself as the supreme Delight. He wants to enjoy Himself not as the owner of the ocean but as the ocean itself. Again, He wants to enjoy Himself as the tiniest drop in the ocean. He can take the form either of the tiniest drop or of the boundless ocean. Here, the ocean is the one embodying the many. If we look at the ocean, we can call it one. Again, if we individually count the drops, we see it as many. But we know that the drops have a source, and vision will say that the source is one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I&#039;ve heard that there are different tones or notes for each Heaven. Could you please describe them?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I&#039;ve heard that there are different tones or notes for each Heaven. Could you please describe them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Heaven means the higher worlds, in this case. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. Each world has a music of its own and a note of its own. The higher worlds have a music that awakens us, inspires us, illumines us, perfects us and fulfils us. The music of the higher worlds constantly comes to us as the harbinger of the highest Height, whereas the music of the lower worlds naturally comes to us as a messenger of destruction.</p>
<p>It is not only the higher and lower worlds that have a music of their own; each individual has his own music, each movement has its own music, each action has its own music. Each time we breathe in and breathe out, there is music. When we don't pay attention to the inner depth of the action, we don't hear the music. If we do pay adequate attention to each action, then inside the very depth of that action we are bound to hear music. Unless we hear music inside each action, the action is lifeless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That indicates an awakening. But this does not mean that your third eye is about to open. No. When you play most soulfully, an inner vision-light will come to the fore. Vision is within you, yet it is dormant. But now it wants to function properly; it does not want to sleep anymore. So inner vision is starting to operate. The vision of the third eye is trying to come to the fore and that is why you are getting that sensation. So it is a very good experience.</p>
<p>When you sing, you may feel an awakening in the throat centre. Those who have good voices have, to some extent, opened their throat centre. This is also a very good experience.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In what way does music affect our consciousness?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In what way does music affect our consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our consciousness is like a book. When we play divine music, we are able to write down something significant in the book. If it is undivine music, we will write down something undivine. The moment we write something undivine, the quality of the book suffers. When we write divine things, we see and feel that the quality of the book is greatly improved.</p>
<p>If we listen to bad music, it is as though we have a piece of paper right in front of us and we have dropped ink on the paper and ruined it. But if we hear good music, we will immediately feel that we have written something divine and immortal on the paper.</p>
<p>Water symbolises consciousness. Consciousness, like water, is neutral. What we put inside water is of paramount importance. If it is something harmless, sweet and divine, then we will get joy. But if we put something undivine, poisonous and destructive in the water, then naturally when we drink it we shall die. What we mix with the water before drinking it is entirely up to us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can use music to help us in our spiritual life provided we know that music and the spiritual life are like twin brothers; we cannot separate them. How can we separate two fingers, two eyes? They sit side by side. If one eye is not functioning well, then we feel that our vision is imperfect. Similarly, we have to know that music and the spiritual life must go together; one complements the other. Music helps the spiritual seeker to go deep within to get the utmost satisfaction from life, from truth, from reality. The spiritual life, in turn, helps music to offer its capacity and its strength, which is the soul's light, to the world at large.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does &#039;soulful&#039; mean in relation to music?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does &#039;soulful&#039; mean in relation to music?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we listen to soulful music, or when we ourselves play soulful music, immediately our inner existence climbs up high, higher, highest. It climbs up and enters into something beyond. This Beyond is constantly trying to help us, guide us, mould us and shape us into our true transcendental image, our true divinity. When we hear soulful music, or when we play a soulful piece of music, we feel a kind of inner thrill in our entire existence, from the soles of our feet to the crown of our head. A river is flowing through us, a river of consciousness, and this consciousness is all the time illumined.</p>
<p>Next to deep prayer or meditation, music is of paramount importance. Meditation is like a direct route, or shortcut, to the goal. Music is a road that is absolutely clear: it may be a little longer, but it is quite clear of obstacles. If one can play soulful music or hear soulful music, the power of his own meditation increases. Music, soulful music, adds to our aspiration. Similarly, if a spiritual seeker wants to be a musician, even if he does not have a musical background, he will be able to be a good musician because prayer and meditation contain all capacities. You have never studied music but if you pray and meditate soulfully, then inside your prayer, inside your meditation, by the Grace of the Supreme, the power of music looms large. Then you can utilise this power in your own way.</p>
<p>Soulful music is the music that immediately elevates our consciousness to the Absolute, to the Highest. But ordinary music, vital music, brings our consciousness down. For a fleeting second or a few hours, we get a kind of pleasure; but then this pleasure takes us into a lower vital consciousness where we are tempted. From the temptation-world we enter into the frustration-world, and from the frustration-world we enter into the destruction-world. But soulful music takes us into the world of aspiration. From aspiration we enter into the world of realisation, where our inner existence is flooded with Light and Delight.</p>
<p>Soulful music is the music that wants to eventually transform our consciousness. It carries us into the Universal Consciousness and makes us feel that we are in tune with the highest, with the deepest, with the farthest.</p>
<p>It also makes us feel that God Himself is the Supreme Musician. When we play soulful music, we come to realise that we are not the musician; we are just an instrument. We are like a piano, violin or guitar, and it is God who is constantly playing on us. If we really play soulful music, we will see that we are just an instrument, that somebody else is singing and playing in and through us, and that somebody is our Inner Pilot, the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whether or not the musician is aspiring is not your business. That is only God's business. When you hear music, if it lifts your consciousness, then you will know that it is spiritual music. Again, somebody may pretend to be spiritual, but if his music brings your consciousness down, then he is not playing spiritual music. Sometimes the musician is aspiring and also he is playing spiritual music; at that time you are very fortunate, because you get both.</p>
