<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here on this side is darkness, confusion, suffering, pain, misunderstanding, negativity and uncertainty, to say the least. On the other side is peace, light, understanding, delight and oneness with God the Creator and God the creation. When one reaches the Highest, one can at once become one with God the Creator and God the creation. I am part of God's creation, you are part of God's creation, everyone is part of God's creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have faith in the creation, then will you not look for the Creator? If you see that a wristwatch is giving the time correctly, then you can be satisfied with the wristwatch and go no further. But if you want to understand how the wristwatch operates, then will you not go to the watchmaker? Similarly, there are millions and billions of people on earth who are satisfied with the world as such. But again, there are some people who are not satisfied. Those who are not satisfied want to dive deep within and find the source or the cause of the suffering in this world. When they go to the Source, they see that it is all light and delight.</p>
<p>It depends on you. You can be satisfied with what you get. Then again, you can say, "Who is giving it to me?" Suppose Sunday was your best marathon and it gave you joy. You can say, "Now, who has given me this joy? Who has given me the capacity to run?" If you say that your own body, vital, mind and heart have given you the capacity, then who has given them the capacity? Somebody else has done it. Once we look for that somebody else, we see that He is none other than our own highest reality. A deer runs here and there searching for the source of the musk that it smells. But the musk is inside the deer itself. Now we are looking for someone. We feel that it is a third person. But when we see that person, we realise that it is only our selfsame reality in its highest form.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, we are lumps of clay. But who has given the form to this clay? When we see a vessel, we know that somebody has made it. It did not just come out of the blue. We have to go to the Source. The earthen pot is not the ultimate reality. Somebody has shaped it. That somebody is the one we are searching for. We can call it the Ultimate Reality, we can call it God, or we can call it by any other name. But we have to give credit to someone. When we go to that somebody, after a long search, we see that the one we sought was our own highest Self. The highest in us was being sought by the lowest. We just climb up from the foot of the tree to the highest branch. When we climb up to the top, we start eating the fruits. Once we know how to climb up, it is up to us to remain either at the foot of the tree or at the top of the tree.</p>
<p>God created us. God gave us the motivation to run. It is an inner urge. It is not that we just come out of our house and run aimlessly. Something within us, an inner urge, inspires us to go outside and run. Who gave us that inner urge? Again, we have to go to the Source. The questions never end until we dive deep within. Then all questions are answered. But it does not happen overnight. As you know, you had to practise for months or years to complete the marathon. Similarly, we have to pray and meditate for years if we want to cover long inner distances. It is a lifelong process.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
SCA 979-987. Excerpts from an interview with sports writer John Hanc of <em>New York Newsday</em>, which took place in New York on 19 November 1989.</p>
<h2>John Hanc: How does running fit in with your teaching?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It perfectly fits in with our philosophy. Prayer and meditation always remind us of our inner running. The only difference between the outer running and the inner running is that in the inner running there is no set goal or destination. In the outer running, as soon as I have finished one hundred metres, let us say, the race is over. I may not win, but I have reached my goal. But in the inner running, we are Eternity's runner. Because we pray and meditate, we know that we have three friends: Eternity, Infinity and Immortality. Because we belong to Eternity, Infinity and Immortality, our journey is birthless and deathless; it has no beginning and no end. We have already started our journey and we are never going to end it. Along the way we may have certain temporary goals. But as soon as we reach these goals, they only become the starting point for new and higher goals.</p>
<p>Before we enter into the spiritual life, we want to possess the world. Our goal, let us say, is to become richer than the richest and to lord it over others like a Napoleon or Julius Caesar. Then gradually we come to realise that there is no satisfaction in this kind of life. We begin to reduce our material greed and diminish our desires. At the same time, we start trying to increase our positive qualities.</p>
<p>Take love, for example. As a child we start out by loving only our dear ones — the members of our immediate family. Then, after some time, we begin to claim the village where we were born as our own. Then we begin loving our district, our province, our country. But even this is not enough. At the United Nations all the nations are trying to become one. So we try to become citizens of the world and love the entire world. Like Socrates, we say, "I am not an Athenian; I am a universal man." So you see how much progress we can make in a positive way. This is our philosophy: anything that is bad — fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, suspicion and so on — we shall decrease, and anything that is good we shall increase. On the positive side, we shall start with an iota of love and expand it until it becomes universal love. There is no end to the amount of love we can have; we can keep expanding it until it encompasses not only God the creation but also God the Creator, who is infinite. When we run in the inner world, we are running along the Road of Eternity, and we just continue, continue, continue.</p>
<p>The inner runner and the outer runner are like two brothers. The older, stronger brother can run a very long distance. But the younger one becomes tired after a certain distance because in the physical we are limited. Not only in the physical, but also in the mind and the vital we are limited. So after some time the outer brother takes rest and then he starts again — following the inner brother who is going on and on.</p>
<p>But even on the outer plane our capacity is constantly expanding. Right now 1,300 miles is our longest race. To run 1,300 miles in 18 days is almost beyond our imagination. We feel that is our ultimate capacity. But previously we felt that 1,000 miles was the limit. Who thought of a 1,300-mile race five years ago? At that time people would have thought I was a crazy man if I had suggested that. But now you see that this crazy man was right because people are doing it. Somebody just has to start. We always have to go ahead because life means progress.</p>
<p>The inner runner is always trying to inspire the outer runner. First the inner runner says, "Go forward, go forward, go ahead, go ahead!" Then the outer runner says, "How can I go ahead if you do not give me the aspiration and inner cry?" Then the inner runner gives the outer runner the inner cry to do something and to become something good. In this way the inner runner offers inspiration and aspiration to the outer runner.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">John Hanc: While running, is it also a time to meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="John Hanc: While running, is it also a time to meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For others I cannot speak, but in my case when I am jogging or walking, I am in a very high consciousness. At that time the world of thought ceases and I am in another world — not the thought-world but the world of self-giving and serving. While running, a runner is all joy unless he is suffering from muscle cramps or some other ailment or he is killing himself trying to become first. But in the New York Marathon, for example, thousands and thousands of people are running just for the joy of it. Even if they take five hours, no harm, so long as they finish. They say, "Every runner is a winner," and it is so true. This is also our philosophy.</p>

Have you got any other ideas?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have other ideas. The only question is whether they can be fully manifested. I am not going to stop at 1,300. But before we go beyond that, the runners must acquire the inner confidence that they can do it. It is just like the idea of the marathon. In the beginning, just a handful of people ran the New York Marathon. At that time people did not have the confidence. Now twenty or thirty thousand people are running it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It gives me joy not only when they come to our races but when they come to anybody's races. Everywhere in the world if people can run, it will help them. One of our absolutely worst enemies is our lethargy. Early in the morning we do not want to get up. Then during the day we are not energetic; we are not inspired to do anything. But in the morning if we can energise ourselves with physical activities, then we can accomplish so many things during the rest of the day. That is why I say sports and physical fitness are of supreme importance. If we neglect the physical and let the body become weak, then the mind also becomes weak. At that time it does not have the strength to think of good things all the time and it starts to think of undivine things.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am extremely happy that they are going out of their way to make sure the athletes do not take drugs. It is a great, great achievement. It is not only a physical or mental achievement; it is not only an achievement in the athletic world. It represents also a great advance for the spiritual life. People who take drugs are destroying their nerves and their health. God created us, so why are we destroying ourselves? We are like a flower in God's Heart-Garden. When we plant a seed, we watch it grow into a beautiful flower. The flower is our creation, and we get so much joy and delight from its beauty and fragrance. But if somebody grabs the flower and tears it to pieces, we will be very sad. Similarly, God is our Creator and He wants us to keep our body strong, our vital dynamic and our mind happy and peaceful.</p>
<p>Somebody may say, "No, it is <em>my</em> body, and I can do whatever I like with it. It is none of your business or anybody else's business what I do with my body." But that is not right. In a family, if right in front of you a brother or sister is taking drugs or becoming alcoholic, is it not your bounden duty to beg them to stop? They may say, "Mind your own business," but you will continue trying to persuade them to stop because you love them. Similarly, every human being is a member of our world-family. Because we claim others as part and parcel of our family, we will keep on trying to get them to do the right thing. If they do not listen, what can we do? But we will keep on trying.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am very happy with the way my spiritual students have created such a good atmosphere for these people and are inspiring them in the running world. As I said, the world is all one family. We are inviting our brothers and sisters to come to our races, and it gives us joy when they participate. Our 1,300-mile race is like a Thanksgiving Day celebration. Once a year the family comes together for Thanksgiving, and it gives us all such joy to see one another again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is no limit to the distance because there is no limit to human capacity. Human capacity depends on our inner hunger — how sincerely we need something or are crying for something. In the material world, if someone has tremendous greed and wants to become a multi-millionaire, he works very hard and eventually he fulfils his desire. But by possessing the material world, we can never be happy. We can only find joy by serving as an instrument of God and fulfilling His Will. If God wants us to be a sprinter or an ultramarathon runner and if we follow His Dictates, then naturally we will become very happy. It will not matter if we stand first or last. Success or failure we shall place at His Feet. What matters is that we are pleasing God in His own Way. How do we know what God wants us to do? By praying and meditating.</p>
<p>If it is God's Will for us to do something, there is absolutely no limit to human capacity. One of my students from Washington, DC is thinner than the thinnest. If you see her, it will be beyond your imagination that she can run 1,000 miles. But she does it. Because of her aspiration and heart's cry, God is supplying her with Grace from Above in the form of inner energy and strength.</p>
<p>In my case, I have lifted heavy weights. In a year's time I have also lifted 1,300 people using only one arm. Many of them were heavier than I am. I have even lifted two people at once, although I am fifty-four years old and my muscles are smaller than the smallest. How is it possible? I have a mind, and I am the first person to disbelieve it. But through God's Grace, it is possible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My longest distance was 47 miles. I did it twice. Now I no longer do it, but every year about three hundred disciples of mine from all over the world come here on my birthday and run 47 miles. Being the spiritual father of the family, it gives me tremendous joy when I see my spiritual children run 47 miles. The number 47 is very important to me because in 1947 India got its independence. With this run we are celebrating our inner freedom.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are not proselytising or propagating our spiritual views. Ours is not a religion — far from it. Ours is only a way of life. We have an inner school and from this inner school we are trying to offer some blessings to the people who believe in the inner life. But we are not asking any runner to follow our path. We are only trying to provide opportunities for them to bring to the fore their own good qualities.</p>

SCA 988-999. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 23 December 1990 in Hawaii.</p>
<h2>Question: Can the old scriptures still help us?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, the old scriptures can still help us, although not all the messages of the old scriptures will be helpful. The world is progressing fast, very fast. Sometimes the old rules and old visions may not or cannot be manifested on earth any more. Again, some old scriptures shed universal light and eternal truth. Some messages of the old scriptures are eternal, while others are not. Some messages were meant only for that age. Those messages cannot and should not be applied now. But those messages which are eternal do help us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life, a worker means a server. What makes a perfect server? A sleepless inner cry to become an unconditional self-giver. Everything that you do, you have to do with a sense of unconditional surrender to God's Will.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is God&#039;s relaxation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is God&#039;s relaxation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God gets tremendous relaxation when he hears one individual sincerely speaking highly of another individual. Very often we speak highly of others to God with the hope that God will tell us, "No, no. Your qualities are far better; they are much more significant." We try to make God feel that we are insignificant so that we can get consolation, appreciation and compassion from God.</p>
<p>God already knows everything, but if He hears that we are sincerely appreciating, admiring and adoring someone else who has really done something great and good for God, then God is extremely happy. If we can offer this piece of good news to God without thinking in a very clever way about getting some appreciation from God, then that is God's relaxation.</p>
