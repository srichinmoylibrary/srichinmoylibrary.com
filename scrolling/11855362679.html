<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In most cases, it was destined that you would come to me. There are many souls with me now that had been connected with me in previous incarnations, and there are quite a few that I knew in the soul’s region. Once they started to aspire here on earth, they looked for me. But not all souls are meant for me.</p>
<p>Today at the United Nations a friend of one of the disciples said to me, “When I come here I get real joy from you, but I have accepted someone else as my Guru.” His soul is pulling him towards me, but his vital is pulling him away. I didn’t encourage him. I told him to stay with his Guru.</p>
<p>Most of the souls that have come to me are meant for me, even those who have left, except perhaps for one or two that the Supreme didn’t want me to have and that He took away in His own Way. He will take care of those, but the others who have left me will have to wait for me to give them a push again. Disciples may leave me on the physical plane, but in the inner world their souls remain my real disciples.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The disciple’s mission</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The disciple’s mission" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After fifty, sixty, eighty or a hundred years, you will see the result of the seeds that we are now sowing. Even if only twenty or thirty persons come to attend a public lecture of mine, no harm. Sometimes I feel extremely sorry when only a few people attend, but even if there is nobody, I am prepared to speak to an empty room, facing the wall. I have to give talks because the Supreme wants me to. On the other hand, if more people come so much the better, since then many people will be able to hear about spiritual things. If each of you feels that my mission is your mission, then you will dedicate yourself in every possible way to help our mission.</p>
<p>One of Sri Ramakrishna’s disciples who was very dedicated to his Master’s mission once took an oath that he would establish a Sri Ramakrishna Centre in Madras. When he came to Madras from Bengal, his possessions were only an umbrella and a picture of Ramakrishna. Come rain, come shine, this young man always carried the picture and the umbrella with him. For years and years he worked with almost nothing. He struggled so hard, and now the Ramakrishna Centre in Madras is well-known all over India.</p>
<p>One day he was giving a talk at the Mylapore Centre. Because it was a rainy day, no one turned up. The speaker stood up and said, “Nobody is here? Where could I get a better audience than the walls?” and he gave the talk. Then he said, “The walls have listened so devotedly; they are my best audience. The walls don’t argue, they don’t make a noise, they don’t contradict my views. Others doubt and suspect; they have other views, but the walls have received all that I wanted to offer. Today my audience was really divine.”</p>
<p>So here also, if people come, immediately the light I have to offer is spread to hundreds and thousands. But if we don’t get people to listen, then like Ramakrishna’s disciple we will say, “The walls have accepted me.” When I spoke in Brandeis University, there were very few people, but right at the back of the audience I saw the Supreme facing me. He said to me, “I am the Listener. I am listening.” So He will listen to us even if we don’t see an audience.</p>
<p>All of us can do dedicated service. I am praying that each disciple can spread the message of the Supreme with devotion and dedication. If you do it without any pride, vanity or ego, then you are fulfilling the Supreme the way the Supreme and I want you to fulfil Him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With disciples you can feel that they are all members of your family. If they are members of your family, then you don’t have to worry. Suppose someone is your brother. He may misunderstand you, but the next moment he will forgive you. You should think of yourself as a child and your brothers and sisters as children. Do not think that they are forty years, fifty years or sixty years old and you are twenty-five. When you speak to them, think that you are four years old and they are also four years old. Feel that they are of your standard. In terms of sincerity, simplicity, purity and other divine qualities, they are of your standard. They may have achieved many things in the outer plane that you have not achieved, but since you want to be spiritual and they want to be spiritual, then there is a common ground. You want to approach them with spirituality; they want to approach you with spirituality. In this way automatically you will become spontaneous.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both are equally important. However, you have to know what kind of service you are offering. Many Indian spiritual Masters and realised souls have spent their time in Himalayan caves and secluded places offering good will to mankind. They did not give public lectures or write books. They have sent their good will to mankind and that was their dedicated service. However, if one meditates and offers good will and also offers dedicated service on the physical plane, he is offering more.</p>
<p>When I meditate with my disciples, I offer them my light and inner wealth. When I go to the United Nations and various universities to give lectures and hold meditations, this is my dedicated service. There are some spiritual figures who do not want to mix with humanity, so they offer their good will at the time of meditation. If one offers a good thought this is a form of dedicated service. However, if a spiritual Master offers something on the outer plane, like meditating with others and bringing down peace, light and bliss for seekers, then naturally his dedicated service is more than that of the person who only offers good will in the inner world. Although both are important, if one can use both hands — inner good will and outer dedicated service — then one can offer more. He who offers both makes a greater contribution to Mother Earth than one who only offers on the inner plane.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I please you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I please you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To please me it is not necessary to constantly think of my philosophy. When you come to me, if you just give me a soulful smile, a pure smile, then you have given me the entire universe. When I see a real, soulful smile on your face, I feel the same kind of happiness I felt the day I realised God. I feel that your smile is equal to my God-realisation. So if you want to make me happy and please me the way I want to be pleased, that to me is as good as my God-realisation.</p>
<p>Those who work for me are also pleasing me. But the individual has to feel how much work he can do for me unnoticed and unappreciated. All your problems, everybody’s problems will be solved today if everyone can work without my outer appreciation. But you feel that you have done this for me and you have done that for me. So I have to smile at you and look at you. You call up one of the disciples and say, “Did Guru ask for me? Did he say anything? What did he say about me?” Soon I will simply tell them to say, “No,” even if I did ask about you. For how many months, for how many hours can you work without being appreciated by me? Others will appreciate you or others may not appreciate you. But if I do not appreciate you and if your friends also do not appreciate you and you still work, then that is your real achievement.</p>
<p>When you do something for me, my inner appreciation is immediate — immediate, I tell you. You people give me a gift on occasion. The moment I open up the gift, the moment I touch the box even, my blessingful gratitude goes to you. You don’t have to fulfil my request; the moment I ask you to do something, my gratitude immediately flows. You will perhaps complete the work two months later. I have not seen the results; I do not know whether you will bring me success or failure. I don’t know that you will ever do the job; perhaps you will bring me zero. But even then my gratitude goes to you.</p>
<p>Just because I have asked you to do something, that means that I have also given you the capacity. Without giving you the capacity, I will never ask you to do something for me. And the moment I ask, the moment I touch something, my inner gratitude flows. So the most effective way to please me is to work unnoticed.</p>
<p>Always try to work without caring for appreciation. Inwardly you are being appreciated the moment you begin. There are many who work this way. When I ask them to work, they just work and then they go away. When they come and when they go, nobody knows. On some rare occasion perhaps I see them through the window, but they do not knock at the door.</p>
<p>This should be your attitude, not only when you are working at my house, but when you are working at other places also. If I ask you to work in Manhattan or elsewhere, you will do the job. But then you wait for appreciation or ask others if Guru has heard about it. Or through someone else you may inform me that you have done the work or that you have achieved this. You are feeling shy. Although you want the appreciation, admiration and glory, you cannot ask me for it directly, so you ask your intimate friends in some way to tell me. At that time I will smile and I will bless you. But I wish to say that you are not getting the same mark that you would otherwise have gotten. You may get practically zero. So there is no better way to please me than to work unnoticed, without appreciation. If you care for outer appreciation, you will never make any progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. We use the terms “unconditional surrender” and “constant surrender.” Sometimes we make complete surrender. It is complete for five minutes and at that time it is unconditional. Then, when five minutes are over, at that time unfortunately it becomes conditional. At that time we cannot expect to realise God. For five minutes we can make unconditional surrender, constant surrender. But at the end of five minutes it becomes conditional. So surrender has to become permanently established in our life. First it has to be temporary, then conditional and then permanent and unconditional. When surrender is unconditional and constant, we will see Light, infinite Light, within ourselves.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one surrender oneself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one surrender oneself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please try to remember that there are two types of surrender. One type of surrender, the type that you are familiar with, is that of the slave to his master. The slave is at the feet of the master. He has no existence of his own. Whatever the master commands, immediately the slave has to do; otherwise the master will punish him. The master is usually rude, unkind and ruthless.</p>
<p>But in the other type of surrender, spiritual surrender, you are surrendering your own lower existence to your higher existence. You can think of your feet as your lower existence and you can think of your head as your higher existence. You know that your feet belong to you and also your head belongs to you. You can criticise your feet and say, “My feet do not have the wisdom that my head has.” Again, let us take the example of the heart. The heart has all wisdom. You can take your feet and place them right inside your heart. When you place your own feet right inside your heart, when you place the lowest inside the highest, then the lowest becomes one with the highest and receives all the divine qualities of the highest in boundless measure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great joy not only in succeeding but also in trying. If we offer the result to the Supreme, then the greatest joy, the all-illumining joy we receive. Whenever we are doing something, we should offer our gratitude to the Supreme. We should feel really grateful that we have been given the opportunity to serve Him, whereas others have not been given this divine opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your inner cry is telling your outer being to be more conscious. In your day-to-day, multifarious activities, you are praying and meditating well, but you can be more conscious, divinely and spiritually conscious, in all your activities. That is the inner cry and you heard it with your physical ears. You know the inner cry is telling your outer being to be more alert, more devoted at every moment. Sometimes in the ideal world, you are ready to do everything for the world, for the manifestation. But if you do not establish your security and purity in each thought, then there will be a yawning gulf between your inner cry and the outer activities. So the inner cry comes forward. I am telling you that each thing you do every day has to be guided by that inner cry. Your inner cry must regulate your outer life. You have to feel that my life can manifest your inner cry. Take it that this child is making an inner cry and not a human cry. At every moment be conscious of what your ideal is, what your aim is. The Goal is your eternal friend.</p>

When we look at the petals of the lotus separately, we get tremendous joy because we are getting the individuality and the personality of each petal and, at the same time, when we look at the petals as a whole, we get the individuality and the personality of the entire lotus.</p>
<p>You are all in my boat together, but I don’t want the disciples to be like some military gymnasts I once saw. How uniform they were! When we exercise too much uniformity, then everything becomes monotonous, mechanical, machinelike — there is no life in it. Here we are staying together and working together, but new inspiration, new light is also entering into us. Today some inspiration is entering into you, and that very inspiration can enter into another disciple a few hours later.</p>
<p>When you are meditating, your own individuality and personality are there, but you are also expanding. When you look at someone else during your meditation, you extend your consciousness. You may not recognise it, you may not believe it or you may not understand it, but it does happen. If you are meditating in a collective way, you will see that your child is an extension of your consciousness and your husband or wife is an extension of your consciousness. For example, when people meditate in front of me, even if their children are not here, sometimes I see the son or daughter in the mother’s or father’s heart or face. Sometimes the children feel very deeply moved by the parents’ meditation even when the children are at home.</p>
<p>You are expanding, expanding, but as an individual you are still yourself, and your wife is still your wife, and your children are still your children. Your family looks so beautiful when it is together here; I see all of you as a unit growing together. Although your daughter may be very young, you are both in the same family. I will never say that your child is so inferior to you that she must not stand next to you or be with you. No, I will simply be moved when I see you together.</p>
<p>Let us think of the play I wrote about Lord Krishna. One disciple had the role of Lord Krishna. From the spiritual point of view he held the highest part; he became Lord Krishna. He played his role extremely well and I was most proud of him. Again, Krishna’s friend Sudam, the most insignificant person, the poorest of all, also did his part well. Krishna was the king, the emperor, the Lord of the empire, the Lord of creation; and the other one, Sudam, had no status at all. When they met, the friend had his own individuality and personality and Krishna also had his own status, but when both of them talked they became one. At that time I was not able to separate Sudam or anybody else in the play from Krishna. They went together. Everybody’s personality and individuality all came together and it became a grand play. If we want to separate the characters, we can; one is Krishna and the other is Arjuna. But when both work together, they don’t lose their personality. When both mix together, they don’t lose their individuality. On the contrary, their personality and individuality are strengthened because one person’s force is entering into the other and vice versa. Additional strength goes from one person to the other. If we belong to the same family, then my strength will enter into you and it will increase your own individuality and personality, and your strength will enter into me.</p>
<p>Suppose you are doing a high meditation at the Centre. A close friend of yours who is not a disciple of mine may come into your consciousness. The soul of your friend may be unable to come to me directly, but that soul may feel a great affinity with your soul so it wants help from you. You yourself are getting help from me, but for your friend’s soul’s real help will come from you, and not directly from me. Of course, it is not the same as your thinking about a member of your family who is a disciple. In this case, the person has not accepted me as his spiritual Master whereas the member of your family has consciously accepted me in every possible way. In his case, the soul gets direct help from me because consciously the heart and soul of that person are here with me.</p>
<p>Each quality in our life, each capacity in our nature, is a kind of individuality and personality. An individual’s qualities or capacities are separating him from somebody else, so each quality is an individuality. Somebody can be a musician and also an architect, a carpenter and a cook. How many capacities one person can show! And these we can take as his individuality and personality. As an individual he is embodying the capacity for music, architecture, carpentry, cooking and so on. Everything he is doing as the same individual, but is it creating a conflict in his life? No. He is harmonising everything because he knows that all these capacities are his and he claims them as his very own. If you take the capacities as individual factors in his life, then you will see that each capacity has its own individuality and personality. But since the individual can house all the capacities perfectly in his life, the music capacity will not be threatened by the carpentry capacity; they will go perfectly together. Different capacities are like individualities and personalities, yet they are going together perfectly. In a group, somebody is a singer, somebody is a dancer, somebody is a poet; but they all harmonise. The group is only an extension of the individuals’ consciousness. Similarly, nobody is losing anything when he has a variety of capacities inside him.</p>
<p>A piano has many keys. Each key has its distinct note or sound, a distinct individuality and personality. When the keys are played together, they don’t lose their individuality and personality but they act as a unit and create something really special. In an orchestra, so many instruments are being played, and each instrument represents or embodies a kind of individuality and personality. But when they are played together, they create such a divine atmosphere; they bring down Heaven on earth. If you take them separately, each one will have its own individuality, but it will not be able to achieve that Kingdom of Heaven on earth. So we expand and we strengthen ourselves when we mix together.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: To overcome imperfections in ourselves, should we feel that it is your responsibility to perfect us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: To overcome imperfections in ourselves, should we feel that it is your responsibility to perfect us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I don’t want tamasic surrender, the surrender of an idle person. You will try your utmost. Then you must feel, “I have tried my utmost with the capacity that You have given me, O Lord Supreme! Now I have nothing else save my surrender.” After trying your best, you have to surrender with absolutely full faith in the Master.</p>
<p>Always think of a child and his mother. Imperfection is nothing but a child in the playground playing in the mud, clay and filthy sand. That is imperfection. We say, “Look at that child wallowing in the pleasure of filth.” But the same child knows that there is an answer. He comes running straight to his mother without going to this side or that side. She will take some soap and water and a towel and clean her child. It is a matter of a few minutes. But if the child has to learn how to clean himself first before coming to the mother, then he will not be able to do it. The child knows what soap looks like, what a towel looks like and what water looks like, but he does not have the capacity to find all these things. But he knows that there is someone who is more than ready to clean him. He has implicit faith in his mother. He knows how much he loves his mother. He feels that his mother is doing this on the strength of their oneness. This very thing the mother will do gladly because she claims the child as her very own and he claims her as his very own.</p>
<p>So when you think of me, you have to feel that you are of me and for me, and I am of you and for you. Otherwise, if you want to aim at perfection individually, it will be like trying to straighten the tail of a dog. As long as you hold it, it is straight. But once you release it, again it becomes crooked. This is Vivekananda’s simile and it is absolutely true. Only when a spiritual Master offers real spiritual perfection does the tail remain straightened. Otherwise you will hold it straight for a while and then you will become tired. Then, when you release it, again it becomes crooked. Human nature is like this.</p>
<p>To the disciples I wish to say that you will reach God with your own aspiration, not with anybody else’s aspiration. Your aspiration plus my grace, my compassion, will take you to God. If you exploit my compassion, then you are finished. I am doing things the way the Supreme wants me to do them. Don’t misunderstand my compassion, don’t exploit my compassion and don’t be jealous of others. With men ego is the worst enemy. It is in no way better than women’s jealousy. So men have to get rid of ego and women have to get rid of jealousy.</p>
<p>I said at one time that I would like to have thirteen unconditionally surrendered disciples. No other Masters have gotten that kind of surrender, which is like delicious food. Let us see if any disciples have that kind of love for me so that they can say, “This incarnation let me give myself to you.” If you can be surrendered for five minutes, then try to be surrendered for fifty years. But unfortunately after five seconds condition comes in.</p>
<p>When I say to give up the ego, I mean give up the feeling of supremacy, the feeling that you have to be better than others. You should say, “If I have doubt, then let me conquer it; if I have fear, then let me conquer it. I want to transcend my ego.” Try to transcend your own undivine qualities; then the ego will immediately go away. Whom have you to excel? Only yourself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The moment you are depressed, try to feel consciously that you have imposed a heavy burden or load on your shoulders. You have to feel that you are a runner and there is a goal for you. You have to run towards your goal. The faster you run, the sooner you will reach the goal. Now, if you deliberately and consciously place something heavy on your shoulders, then naturally your speed will be very slow. So do not be unwise; you have entered into this race. Again, this race is not competition with somebody else, it is only competition against yourself and against the undivine forces: depression, doubt, fear, jealousy and all the other negative forces.</p>
<p>The moment depression enters into your mind or vital, please feel that there is a heavy load on your shoulders. Then naturally you will try to get rid of it because you want to run the fastest. You will discard it, just throw it aside, and then you will run towards your destined goal as fast as you can.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all. Possessions are not a hindrance to the soul’s development. We have to have a different attitude towards life’s problems and life’s activities. All hindrances, even if at first we consider them as hindrances, can be taken as opportunities in our life. If we take them as hurdles, then each hurdle will give us an opportunity to cross over it and come closer to our goal. What we think of as a hindrance is not a hindrance in God’s view.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is not a hindrance at all; it is a lack of wisdom. If I have money, that does not mean that I shall squander it all the time. I have to know when to use it and how to use it for a right purpose, for a divine purpose. Similarly, there are many things that might distract me or prevent me from following the spiritual path or the inner life. It is I who am the master of my possessions. I shall have to deal with them according to the dictates of my soul. If I have a TV in my room, then it is I who use the TV, it is not the TV that uses me. I am the master of my possessions. As long as I am the master of my possessions, it is I who have to control my mind and say, “No. I have to go and listen to a spiritual talk, which will be more important than watching a TV show.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, that is not so. If laziness enters, then you may say, “Who cares? Spiritual life is not meant for me; it is something unreal. It is the mind that is creative.” If what you are saying were true, then the poorest people would all be inclined to follow the spiritual life. But it is not like that. There are beggars in India and here also who do not care for the spiritual life. Poverty does not mean that you are one inch closer to God. It is a mistake to say so. The possessions are not responsible for what you do; it is the possessor who is responsible. I am sure you have heard the name of King Janaka. He had a vast kingdom, but in spite of having this vast kingdom his whole life was always devoted to God and God-realisation. Similarly, the material prosperity of the West need not be an obstacle to God-realisation. You must feel that you are the possessor and that you must not be possessed by what you have. Those who don’t have possessions will always harbor ill-feelings because they are poor and they don’t have anything. This feeling will cause difficulties to arise in them. You have a television and therefore you do not want to attend a spiritual class; but the person who does not have a television is thinking of something else. He is not aspiring either. So always you have to see the difference between the possession and the possessor. You have to separate the possessor from the possession.</p>
