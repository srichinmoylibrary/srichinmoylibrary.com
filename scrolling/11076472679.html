  <h2 id="page-title">Consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>The New School for Social Research; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>7 April 1970</em></p>
<p>Consciousness is our real teacher, our dear friend and our sure slave. As a slave, consciousness carries our teeming ignorance to God. As a friend, consciousness tells us what the supreme Knowledge is. As a teacher, consciousness reveals to us the undeniable truth that today’s imperfect and unfulfilled man is tomorrow’s perfect and fulfilled God.</p>
<p>Consciousness sings. It sings the song of universal Oneness. Consciousness plays. It plays the game of cosmic Manifestation. Consciousness dances. It dances with God’s fulfilling Vision within and God’s fulfilled Reality without. Consciousness acts. It acts through man’s crying, climbing and surrendering aspiration, and God’s descending, protecting and illumining Compassion.</p>
<p>When consciousness is all activity, it bows to God the Mother, its Source. When consciousness is all silence, it bows to God the Father, its Source. From the Mother, it gets the mightiest Power to make the supreme sacrifice for the unconscious earth. From the Father, it gets the highest Light to illumine the unlit earth. Consciousness itself is at once Light and Power. As Light, it identifies with the pure inspiration and deep aspiration of our inner world. As Power, it exercises its divine sovereignty over the darkest bondage and the wildest ignorance of our outer world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consciousness that the unaspiring body uses is called the hopeful consciousness. The consciousness that the unyielding vital uses is known as the hurtful consciousness. The consciousness that the uncompromising mind uses is called the doubtful consciousness. The consciousness that the uncovering heart uses is called the truthful consciousness. The consciousness that the unlimited soul uses is called the fruitful consciousness.</p>
<p>— Aum Anandamayee Chaitanyamayee Satyamayee Parame O Mother Absolute of Existence-Consciousness-Delight!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This triple consciousness is the longest length, farthest breadth and deepest depth. The longest length is Infinity. The farthest breadth is Eternity. The deepest depth is Immortality. When consciousness lives in existence, humanity devotedly receives what Divinity soulfully offers. When consciousness lives inside its own domain, humanity and Divinity lovingly yet surprisingly share each other’s experience. When consciousness lives in Delight, humanity is realised and transformed and Divinity is manifested and fulfilled.</p>
<p>Blind is he who does not see the Consciousness-Light. Deaf is he who does not obey the Consciousness-right. Poor is he who cannot eat the Consciousness-fruit. Foolish is he who denies the existence of the Consciousness-sea.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The inner freedom</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The inner freedom" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Fairfield University; Fairfield, Connecticut, USA</em><br /><em>8 April 1970</em></p>
<p>The outer freedom is to see what we should. The inner freedom is to be what we must. What we should see is the golden face of Truth. What we must be is the flowing Life of God’s Vision and the glowing Breath of God’s Reality.</p>
<p>The mother of freedom is Light. The father of freedom is Truth. The wife of freedom is Peace. The son of freedom is Courage. The daughter of freedom is Faith.</p>
<p>Freedom rings where Light shines. Freedom rings when Truth sings. Freedom rings if Peace expands. Freedom rings because Courage demands. Freedom rings, hence Faith blossoms.</p>
<p>Somebody said, “When there is more freedom for mankind, the women will have it.” This deplorable statement fails to breathe in the inner world. In the inner world, woman and man have equal freedom to cherish the mind’s inspiration, the heart’s aspiration and the soul’s realisation. Furthermore, inspiration is woman; aspiration is man; and realisation is man and woman both.</p>
<p>We fight for the outer freedom. We cry for the inner freedom. With the outer freedom, we see and rule the four corners of the globe. With the inner freedom, we see the Soul and become the Goal of the entire universe.</p>
<p>True freedom does not lie in speaking ill of the world, or in speaking ill of an individual or individuals. Again, true freedom does not lie in merely appreciating and admiring the world or humanity at large. True freedom lies only in our inseparable oneness with the world’s inner cry and its outer smile. The world’s inner cry is God the Realisation. The world’s outer smile is God the Manifestation.</p>
<p>Freedom is expressive. This is what the body tells me. Freedom is explosive. This is what the vital tells me. Freedom is expensive. This is what the mind tells me. Freedom is illumining. This is what the heart tells me. Freedom is fulfilling. This is what the soul tells me.</p>
<p>My outer freedom is my self-imposed and self-aggrandised obligation. My inner freedom is the birthright of my eternal aspiration and my endless realisation.</p>
<p>Now, the paramount question is whether or not my inner freedom and my outer freedom can run abreast. Certainly they can. Certainly they must. My inner freedom knows what it has and what it is: realisation. My outer freedom must know what it wants and what it needs: transformation.</p>
<p>When the freedom of my life without is soulfully and unreservedly transformed, it immediately becomes the mightiest might and the highest pride of the freedom of my life within.</p>
<p>My outer freedom is my life-boat. My inner freedom is my life-sea. My God is my Pilot Supreme. Today I am my journey’s searching and crying soul. Tomorrow I shall be my journey’s illumining and fulfilling Goal.</p>
<p>My soul of freedom is my God’s compassionate and constant Necessity. My goal of freedom is my God’s smiling and dancing Transcendental Assurance everlastingly fulfilled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Earth-bound time and timeless time</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Earth-bound time and timeless time" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Long Island University; Brooklyn, New York, USA</em><br /><em>10 April 1970</em></p>
<p>Time: earth-bound time and timeless time. When I look upward, I earn time. When I look forward, I utilise time. When I look inward, I save time. When I look backward, I waste time.</p>
<p>How do I use my time? I use my time serving sincere seekers. When do I use my time? I use my time when God commands my service and man, the aspirant, needs my light. There are only two things: time and life. Time is for life and life is of time. In life, we see God. In time, through time, we become consciously one with God.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein, the world-renowned scientist, said something most striking: “When we sit with a nice girl for two hours, we think it is only for a minute. When we sit on a hot stove for a minute, we think it is for two hours. And that is relativity.”</p>
<p>In the spiritual world we come across a similar experience. When we go to a real spiritual Master and drink deep of his divine Peace, Light and Bliss for two hours, we feel we have been with him for only a fleeting minute. And when we sit on the stove of wild ignorance for just a fleeting second, we feel it is for an endless hour. This is spirituality, an eager aspirant’s reality.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon also said something striking: “To choose time is to save time.” This is a most significant statement. Now, why do we choose time and how can we choose time? We can choose time by loving time. How can we love time? We can love time by meditating constantly on our life’s promise to God. What is our life’s promise to God? The promise is that God’s Light Divine will grow and glow in human life.</p>
<p>What happens when we save time? Opportunity knocks at the door of possibility, and possibility knocks at the door of inevitability. Possibility says to opportunity while opening the door, “My child, you are wise.” Inevitability says to possibility while opening the door, “My child, you are no longer your searching soul. Today you have become your fulfilling Goal.”</p>
<p>“I am the mighty, world-devouring Time.” This message is from the Bhagavad Gita, the Song Celestial sung by Lord Krishna. We have to know what is actually devoured and destroyed—ignorance, limitation, bondage, imperfection and death. Sri Krishna has already told the human aspirant, Arjuna, why He has appeared on earth: “Whenever righteousness declines and unrighteousness prevails, I embody Myself, O Arjuna. To protect the good, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma [the inner code of life], I come into being from age to age.”</p>
<p>In our day-to-day human experience we very often feel that time destroys us. Herbert Spencer, on behalf of suffering humanity, says, “Time is that which man always tries to kill, but which ends in killing him.” We try to kill time. But what actually happens is that time ultimately kills us, devours us. Our hopes are dashed, our desires are frustrated. When founded on insincerity, doubt, worries and anxieties, our aspiration unfortunately fails to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Earth-bound time and timeless time. In our day-to-day life we use earth-bound time. This time measures all our activities and can itself be measured — one hour, two hours, three hours. Again, one hour is divided into sixty minutes, one minute into sixty seconds. We can break earth-bound time into pieces. We can pick the time; we can be on time. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, we will get up. At eight o’clock we shall be in the office. At eleven o’clock at night we will go to bed. Time is registering our life-activities.</p>
<p>But timeless time is totally different. It is like a river flowing into the sea, merging into the sea and, finally, becoming one with the sea. On the strength of its oneness, it becomes the boundless vast. Here the finite enters into the Infinite and loses itself. What happens when the Infinite plays its role in the finite?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“O Infinite, in the heart of the finite You are playing Your own melodies. In me is Your Revelation and Manifestation. Therefore, ecstasy within, ecstasy without.” India’s greatest poet, Rabindranath Tagore, sang this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earth-bound time. The body uses this time. The physical consciousness uses this time. The physical mind uses this time. We can use or misuse this time. But once we use or misuse it, this time is exhausted. We cannot get it back.</p>
<p>The soul uses boundless time. Infinity looms large in this time. And if we are consciously one with the soul, we can use the boundless time, the eternal time. We also can misuse it if we want to. But fortunately our soul will not permit us to misuse this time. And even if we do misuse it, the time still remains boundless, eternal.</p>
<p>In our earth-bound time we observe one thing: today we have a headache, tomorrow time cures it. Today we suffer from some ailments, tomorrow we are cured. Time comes to our rescue. Similarly, our soul sees a disease in the earth-atmosphere. The soul itself has no disease, for it is beyond disease, beyond death. But in the earth-atmosphere the soul sees the most fatal disease of all, ignorance: ignorance within, ignorance without. The soul wants to put an end to this ignorance. That is, the soul feels that each human being can swim across the sea of ignorance and, finally, dive into the sea of the soul’s infinite plenitude. The hour has to strike. When it does, it is up to us how we utilise this hour.</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha, teaching his disciples, was reading something from a sacred book. After a while he said, “The evening has set in,” and closed the book. Immediately his disciples realised that it was time for them to meditate, so they entered into meditation. On that particular day, two newcomers, a thief and a woman of ill repute, had attended Lord Buddha’s discourse. The thief immediately decided that it was time for him to go and commit a theft. So he left the place. The woman of ill fame realised that it was time for her to go home and wait for her friends. And this she did. At the same hour a seeker of the infinite Truth enters into meditation, a thief does what he thinks best for him and a woman of ill repute does what she feels best for her.</p>
<p>In our spiritual life also, when the hour strikes, three different types of seekers play three different roles. There are lamentable seekers, able seekers and admirable seekers. Lamentable seekers are those who come to a spiritual Master out of curiosity, because they see that thousands of other seekers are flocking towards him. They have countless problems, and they feel that the moment they come to a spiritual Master all their problems will be solved: family problems, financial problems and other kinds of problems.</p>
<p>The able seekers have faith in themselves and faith in God, fifty percent each. They feel that God is pleased with them, and showers His choice blessings upon them just because they meditate. They feel that their realisation is due in part to their personal effort and in part to God’s Grace, and they are happy when they finally reach their Goal.</p>
<p>The admirable seekers feel that their realisation has taken place precisely because God has showered infinite Grace upon them. They feel it is God’s Grace that has enabled them to realise the highest Truth. Their prayer is, “O God, fulfil Yourself in and through us. If You want us to remain unrealised, unknown and imperfect, we are fully prepared. If You want us to realise the highest Truth, to enter into Infinity, Eternity and Immortality, then we are also prepared to do this. Our only prayer is to please You, to fulfil You, the way You want to be pleased and fulfilled. We reject all personal choice. It is Your Choice that we want in our life. We have one aim, one Goal: to fulfil You in Your own Way, at Your own Golden Hour.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The song of the ego</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The song of the ego" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Adelphi University; Garden City, New York, USA</em><br /><em>15 April 1970</em></p>

<p>My ego needs.<br /> My soul has.<br /> My ego tries.<br /> My soul does.<br /> My ego knows the problem that is.<br /> My soul becomes the answer that is.<br /> I am not alone.<br /> Within my unlit self:<br /> My ego, my naked death.<br /> I am not alone.<br /> Within my snow-white heart:<br /> My soul, and my Spirit’s Flame.</p>

<p>Ego is the thief of thieves. Not to speak of ordinary experiences, even realisations are afraid of this intruder.</p>
<p>To feel the absence of ego is as difficult as to see God’s constant Presence in oneself. Ego helps bondage grow. Bondage, in return, helps ego flourish or run amok.</p>
<p>Self-pity, self-indulgence and egoistic emotional cries are but one shortcoming with different names.</p>
<p>O small ego, O big ego, do not worry. Both of you have God’s Compassion at your disposal. As there is no difference between a rill and a river when they run into the sea, neither is there a difference between an ordinary man and an important man when they dive into the sea of God’s Compassion.</p>
<p>Ego is diversity in unfulfilling action. Surrender is unity in fulfilled action, fulfilled manifestation and fulfilled perfection.</p>
<p>Self-advertisement cannot even touch the feet of God-realisation. God-realisation cannot lower itself even to touch the head of self-advertisement.</p>
<p>To think oneself always great is to believe that toil and skill are unnecessary.</p>
<p>No doubt, man is infinitely superior to a wild beast. But he always drinks two bottles of poison: one bottle is ego and the other is doubt. Until he has done away with these two bottles, man is no more than a higher animal.</p>
<p>To strive to do something unique is undoubtedly good, but it is better to know whether that unique thing is what God wants you to do.</p>
<p>The difference between God and man is this: man is the determining ‘I’. God is the determined ‘We’.</p>
<p>Happy is he who has overcome all selfishness. Blessed is he who sees God emerging from the sea of his ego.</p>
<p>The moment we remove the mirror of self-flattery from our eyes and hold up before us the mirror of Truth, we see a half-animal jumping within and without us.</p>
<p>With your unlit and wild ego do not destroy yourself. Suicide is the worst possible barrier to the goal of Self-realisation. If you destroy yourself, instead of starting your next life where you have left off in this one, you will have to go back to a much earlier point.</p>
<p>There is one defeat that brings us an even greater triumph than victory does. What is that defeat? The defeat of our ego by our soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Immortality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Immortality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>University of Massachusetts; Amherst, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>24 April 1970</em></p>
<p>He who does not aspire thinks that Immortality is an impossibility. He who aspires feels that Immortality is a sure possibility. He who has realised God knows that Immortality is an absolute reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘Impossible!’ That is not good French,” says Napoleon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“ ‘Impossible!’ That is not good self-discovery.” This is what I say. Today’s self-discovery is tomorrow’s Immortality.</p>
<p>It is good to be immortal, but it is infinitely better to be divine. Socrates said something quite memorable: “All men’s souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are both immortal and divine.”</p>
<p>If Divinity looms large inside Immortality, then only can reality be all-embracing, all-sustaining and all-fulfilling.</p>
<p>The outer life is humanity. The inner life is Immortality. The life around is reality. The life above is Divinity. The life below is obscurity.</p>
<p>When Divinity descends into humanity, the soul of humanity becomes hopeful. When Divinity descends into Immortality, the soul of Immortality becomes meaningful. When Divinity enters into reality, the soul of reality becomes fruitful. When Divinity enters into obscurity, the soul of obscurity becomes prayerful.</p>
<p>God inspires man with His immortal Inspiration. Man realises God with his immortal self-consecration. God meditates on man for his immortal perfection. Man meditates on God for His immortal Manifestation.</p>
<p>To copy others is an act of stupidity. To copy oneself is an act of absurdity. To imitate God is to imitate Immortality. When we imitate God, our life of imagination ends and our life of realisation dawns.</p>
<p>How can we imitate God when we do not know who God is? God is the Man Divine, supremely inspiring there in Heaven and supremely sacrificing here on earth.</p>
<p>What is Immortality? Immortality is the Consciousness divine that eternally grows and endlessly flows. While growing, it reaches God the Transcendental; while flowing, it reaches God the Universal.</p>
<p>The body says, “Life is but pressure.” The vital says, “Life is but pleasure.” The mind says, “Life is the homeland of ideas.” The heart says, “Life is the homeland of ideals.” The soul says, “Life is the homeland of experiences.” God says, “Life is the homeland of Immortality.”</p>
<p>Mother Earth symbolises human aspiration. Hence, it is a woman in the Upanishads, Maitreyi, who teaches humanity the highest aspiration towards God: “Of what use to me are things that do not make me immortal?”</p>
<p>Let us be inseparably one with Maitreyi and feel that mortality’s binding consciousness is bound to be flooded with the boundless consciousness of Immortality.</p>
<p>O aspiring man, go deep within. Listen to God whisper, “My child, you are good. Therefore, I have made you My Infinity’s Heart. My child, you are nice. Therefore, I have made you My Eternity’s Breath. My child, you are great. Therefore, I have made you My Immortality’s Life.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Intuition</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Intuition" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>University of Maine; Orono, Maine, USA</em><br /><em>24 April 1970</em></p>
<p>Intuition is a push and a pull. It is an inner push and an outer pull. The push comes from our aspiration. The pull comes from God’s Illumination.</p>
<p>When God invites an aspirant to dine with Him, it is the aspirant’s intuition that immediately accepts the invitation. The mind is fond of investigation and invention. The heart is fond of aspiration and unification. Intuition is fond of illumination and supramentalisation. Intuition tells us in a flash what God looks like. Realisation in a twinkling tells us who God is. Intuition, like an arrow, flies towards the Goal. Realisation, like an expert dancer, eternally dances in the heart of the Goal.</p>
<p>Intuition is the creation above the mind. Intuition is the freedom beyond the mind. Intuition is the evolution of consciousness-light outside the boundaries of the physical mind.</p>
<p>Again, there is an infinitely inferior form of intuition in the body, the vital, the mind and the heart. The intuition in the body is practically blind. In the vital, it is powerfully obscure; in the mind, surprisingly uncertain; in the heart, deplorably helpless.</p>
<p>The difference between intuition and will-power is this: intuition sees the Truth; will-power wants to become the Truth. Intuition has the ability to shorten the road that leads to the highest Illumination. Will-power has the ability to bathe in the sea of Illumination.</p>
<p>Imagination is not intuition. Inspiration is not intuition. Aspiration is not intuition. But when intuition presents imagination with the Truth, imagination successfully expands the Truth. When intuition presents inspiration with the Truth, inspiration soulfully embraces the Truth. When intuition presents aspiration with the Truth, aspiration devotedly devours the Truth.</p>
<p>Intuition is the golden link between Vision and Reality. Vision needs intuition to carry its all-transforming message to humanity. Reality needs intuition to carry its all-surrendering message to Divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Aspiration: the inner flame</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Aspiration: the inner flame" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Purdue University; Lafayette, Indiana, USA</em><br /><em>27 April 1970</em></p>
<p>God had a glowing Dream. The name of that Dream was Aspiration. Man has a climbing cry. The name of this cry is also aspiration. God was originally One. With His Aspiration, God wanted to become Many. He wanted to divinely enjoy and supremely fulfil Himself in and through an infinite number of forms.</p>
<p>Man is many. With his aspiration, man the dividing and divided consciousness, man the obscure mind, man the unfulfilled being wants to become one with the world-consciousness, the world-life and the world-soul. He unmistakably and soulfully feels that this is the secret and sacred way to feel the deepest depth of Reality and the highest height of Truth.</p>
<p>Aspiration is the inner flame. Unlike other flames, this flame does not burn anything. It purifies, illumines and transforms our life. When purification takes place in our lower nature, we hope to see the Face of God. When illumination dawns in our outer nature, we feel that God is near and dear, that He is all-pervading and all-loving. When our nature, both lower and outer, grows into the transformation-flame, we shall realise the Truth that God Himself is the inmost Pilot, brightest Journey and highest Goal.</p>
<p>Some people are under the impression that desire and aspiration are the same thing. Unfortunately or, rather, fortunately that is not true. They are two totally different things. The difference between desire and aspiration is very simple and clear. Desire wants to bind and devour the world. Aspiration wishes to free and feed the world. Desire is the outgoing energy. Aspiration is the inflowing light. Desire says to man, “Possess everything. You will be happy.” Poor man, when he wants to possess just one single thing, he sees that he has already been mercilessly caught and possessed by everything in God’s Creation.</p>
<p>Aspiration says to man, “Realise only one thing, and that thing is God. You will be happy.” Fortunate and blessed man — on his way upward and inward, long before he sees God, he feels sublime peace in his inner life and radiating joy in his outer life. He feels that the realisation of the Supreme Beyond can no longer remain a far cry.</p>
<p>Aspiration has not one but three genuine friends: yesterday, today and tomorrow. Yesterday offered its inspiration-flight to aspiration. Today offers its dedication-might to aspiration. Tomorrow will offer its realisation-delight to aspiration.</p>
<p>Aspiration is our inner urge to transcend both the experience and the realisation already achieved. This is absolutely necessary because God the Infinite constantly transcends His own Infinity, God the Eternal constantly transcends His own Eternity and God the Immortal constantly transcends His own Immortality.</p>
<p>The childhood of aspiration wants to realise the Supreme in an earthly and individual way. The adolescence of aspiration wants to realise the Supreme in a divine and glorious way. The adulthood of aspiration wants to realise the Supreme in the Supreme’s own Way.</p>
<p>Aspiration is realisation. Aspiration is revelation. Aspiration is manifestation. Aspiration is realisation if and when the aspirant needs God-realisation and God-realisation alone. Aspiration is revelation if and when the aspirant feels that God-revelation is absolutely for God’s sake. Aspiration is manifestation if and when the aspirant feels that God-manifestation is his birthright.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Reality</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Reality" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Case Western Reserve University; Cleveland, Ohio, USA</em><br /><em>28 April 1970</em></p>
<p>There are three realities: God, soul and life. God is the Transcendental Reality. Soul is the inmost reality. Life is the universal reality. God reveals the soul; the soul reveals life. God the Reality lives in His creative Will. Soul the reality lives in its sustaining will. Life the reality lives in its fulfilling will.</p>
<p>Again, God’s Realisation embodies His creative Will. His Concern shelters the soul’s sustaining will. His Compassion feeds the life’s fulfilling will.</p>
<p>Reality is the constant and dynamic process of our inner evolution. The reality of the past is growing. The reality of the present is soaring. The reality of the future will be glowing.</p>
<p>Real reality is not an escape from life. It is the acceptance of life, the expression of life and the interpretation of life. When we accept life, we become divine warriors. When we express life, we become conscious representatives of God. When we interpret life, we become God’s eternal Pride.</p>
<p>Reality is at once the expansion of our human consciousness and the essence of our divine Consciousness. Human consciousness shakes hands with possibility and ability. Divine Consciousness embraces faith and surrender. The flowering of human consciousness is realisation. The flowering of divine Consciousness is manifestation. The human consciousness thought that God was unknowable. Now it feels that God is merely unknown. Soon it will realise that God is unmistakably and unreservedly knowable. The divine Consciousness knows that there was nothing, there is nothing and there can be nothing other than God.</p>
<p>Faith is the simple, direct, effective and complete form of reality. Doubt is the complex, indirect, ineffective and incomplete form of reality. Faith is God-comprehension. Faith is God-description. Doubt is Truth-detention. Doubt is life-suffocation.</p>

<p>Reality’s unity is God’s Existence.<br /> Reality’s multiplicity is God’s Experience.<br /> Reality’s singularity is God the Eternal Lover.<br /> Reality’s plurality is God the Eternal Love.<br /> Reality’s Time-age is Eternity.<br /> Reality’s Experience-age is Infinity.<br /> Reality’s Realisation-age is Immortality.</p>

<p><em>Columbia University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>St. Paul’s Chapel</em><br /><em>23 April 1971</em></p>
<p>Dear sisters and brothers, we belong to one family, one spiritual family. The head of this spiritual family is the Supreme, our Inner Pilot. Today I offer to each of you my soulful gratitude for granting me the opportunity to be of dedicated service to the Supreme in you. Nothing gives me greater joy than to be of selfless service to the Supreme in humanity. Again and again, to each seeker present here this evening, I offer gratitude, soulful gratitude, endless gratitude, from the inmost recesses of my heart.</p>
<p>Our Inner Pilot is crying for us. Let us run, run towards His Boat. Let us enter into His Boat, and let us sail along with Him towards the Golden Shore of the Beyond. He is our Aspiration. He is our Soul. He is at the same time our journey’s perpetual Goal. He is our own, very own. We came into the world, Him to serve, Him to reveal, Him to manifest, Him to fulfil. He showers His choicest blessings on the dedicated hearts of His spiritual children.</p>
<p>“Uttisthata jagrata…/ — Arise, awake! Awake, arise!” Let us stop not until the Goal of Goals is won. This Goal of Goals is the Heart of the Supreme, our Eternal Pilot.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Upanishads: India’s soul-offering</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Upanishads: India’s soul-offering" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Princeton University; Princeton, New Jersey, USA</em><br /><em>22 October 1971</em></p>
<p>India’s soul-offering is the perennial light of the Upanishads. The Upanishads offer to the world at large the supreme achievement of the awakened and illumined Hindu life.</p>
<p>The Vedas represent the cow. The Upanishads represent milk. We need the cow to give us milk, and we need milk to nourish us.</p>
<p>The Upanishads are also called the Vedanta. The literal meaning of Vedanta is ‘the end of the Vedas’. But the spiritual meaning of Vedanta is ‘the cream of the Vedas, the pick of the inner lore, the aim, the goal of the inner life’. The <em>Muktikopanishad</em> tells us something quite significant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tilesu tailavad vede vedantah supratisthitah</em></p>
<p>Like oil in the sesame seed, Vedanta is established essentially in every part of the Vedas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Upanishads tell us that there are two types of knowledge: a higher knowledge and a lower knowledge. <em>Paravidya</em> is the higher knowledge, and <em>aparavidya</em> is the lower knowledge. The higher knowledge is the discovery of the soul. The lower knowledge is the fulfilment of the body’s countless demands.</p>
<p>According to our Indian tradition, there were once one thousand one hundred and eighty Upanishads. Each came from one branch, <em>sakha</em>, of the Vedas. Out of these, two hundred Upanishads made their proper appearance and, out of these two hundred, one hundred and eight Upanishads are now traceable. If a seeker wants to get some glimpse of Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss, then he must assiduously study these one hundred and eight Upanishads. If a real seeker, a genuine seeker, wants to get abundant light from the Upanishads, then he has to study the thirteen principal Upanishads. If he studies the principal Upanishads and, at the same time, wants to live the Truth that these Upanishads embody, then he will be able to see the face of Divinity and the heart of Reality.</p>
<p>The thirteen principal Upanishads are: <em>Isa</em>, <em>Katha</em>, <em>Kena</em>, <em>Prasna</em>, <em>Mundaka</em>, <em>Mandukya</em>, <em>Chandogya</em>, <em>Brhadaranyaka</em>, <em>Taittiriya</em>, <em>Aitareya</em>, <em>Svetasvatara</em>, <em>Kaivalya</em> and <em>Maitri</em>.</p>

<p><em>Tad ejati tan naijati tad dure tadvantike…</em><br /> That moves, and That moves not.<br /> That is far, and the same is near.<br /> That is within all this;<br /> That is also without all this.</p>

<p>The <em>Isa</em> Upanishad has this special message for us. To the desiring mind, this message is vapid, nebulous, puzzling and confusing. To the aspiring heart, this message is inspiring and illumining. To the revealing soul, this message is fulfilling and immortalising. Brahman, God in His absolute Aspect, is immutable; but in His conditional Aspect He is ever-changing, ever-transforming, ever-evolving, ever-revealing, ever-manifesting and ever-fulfilling.</p>
<p>Again, the <em>Isa</em> Upanishad reconciles work and knowledge, the One and the many, the impersonal God and the personal God, in a striking manner. Work done with detachment is real knowledge. When we consciously try to see God in everything and in everybody, we soulfully offer ourselves to dedicated action. Thus knowledge is action. The One and the many: we need the One for our self-realisation; we need the many for our self-manifestation. The impersonal and the personal God: when we live in the impersonal God, we see Truth in its illumining Vision; and when we live in the personal God, we see Truth in its revealing Reality.</p>
<p>The Son of God declared, “I and my Father are one.” The <em>Chandogya</em> Upanishad makes a bold statement, to some extent more daring and, at the same time, more convincing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tat twam asi</em> That thou art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it mean? It means that you are none other than God. Who else is God, if not you?</p>
<p>A God-lover knocked at God’s Heart-Door. God, from within, said, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>The God-lover said, “It is I.” The door remained locked. The man knocked and knocked. Finally, he went away.</p>
<p>After an hour, he came back again. He knocked at God’s Heart-Door. God, from within, said, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>The God-lover said, “It is I.” The door remained locked. The man knocked and knocked at the door in vain. Finally, he left.</p>
<p>After another hour, again he came back and knocked at God’s Heart-Door. From within, God said, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>The God-lover said, “My Eternal Beloved, it is Thou.” God immediately opened His Heart-Door.</p>
<p>When a seeker feels this kind of intimate and inseparable oneness with God, God opens His Heart-Door to him and offers him His very Throne.</p>
<p>The Upanishadic Seers felt no necessity to go to any spiritual centre, no necessity to go to a temple, no necessity to hear a talk or a sermon or even to study books. God was their only outer book, and God was their only inner Teacher. God-realisation was their only necessity, and God-manifestation was their only reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great German philosopher, Schopenhauer, voiced forth, “In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the solace of my life; it will be the solace of my death. They are the products of the highest wisdom. They are destined sooner or later to become the faith of the people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Upanishads offer us three lessons. The first lesson is Brahman. The second lesson is atman. The third lesson is jagat. Brahman is God, atman is the soul, and jagat is the world. When we meditate on Brahman, our life grows into immortalising Bliss. When we meditate on the soul, our life becomes a conscious and speedy evolution. When we do not neglect the world, our life becomes fulfilling manifestation.</p>
<p>If you study the Upanishads, not in a cursory or perfunctory manner, but with the mind’s clarity, then you will see that God and you, you and God, are eternal. And if you study the Upanishads with your heart’s receptivity, you will see that God and you are equal. And finally, if you study the Upanishads with your soul’s light, you will come to realise that there in Heaven you are the realised and esoteric God, and here on earth you are the manifested and exoteric God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nayam atma balahinena labhyo</em> The soul cannot be won by the weakling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inner strength dethrones the idol which has been installed by fear and doubt. When your inner strength comes to the fore, the poltroon, the doubter in you, will be transformed into the soul’s effulgent light.</p>
<p>The Upanishads are the obverse of the coin of which the reverse is consciousness. There are three states of ordinary consciousness: <em>jagrti</em>, <em>svapna</em> and <em>susupti</em>. <em>Jagrti</em> is the waking state, <em>svapna</em> is the dreaming state, <em>susupti</em> is the state of deep sleep. There is another state of consciousness which is called <em>turiya</em>, the pure consciousness of the Transcendental Beyond.</p>
<p>The <em>Mandukya</em> Upanishad offers us a most significant gift. It tells us about the Universal Soul. The Universal Soul has two aspects: <em>vaisvanara</em> and <em>virat</em>. The microcosmic aspect is called <em>vaisvanara</em>; the macrocosmic aspect is called virat. <em>Jagrti</em>, the waking state; <em>vaisvanara</em>, the physical condition; and the letter ‘A’ from ‘AUM’, the sound symbol of <em>Prakrti</em>, the primal energy, form the first part of Reality. <em>Svapna</em>, the dreaming state; <em>taijasa</em>, the brilliant intellectual impressions; and ‘U’ from ‘AUM’ form the second part of Reality. <em>Susupti</em>, the state of deep sleep; <em>prajña</em>, the intuitive knowledge; and ‘M’ from ‘AUM’ form the third part of Reality.</p>
<p>But <em>turiya</em>, the fourth state of consciousness, at once embodies and transcends these three states of consciousness. On the one hand, it is one part of the four parts; on the other hand, it is the culminating whole, the end, the Goal itself. <em>Turiya</em> is the Reality eternal, beyond all phenomena. <em>Turiya</em> is the Transcendental Brahman. <em>Turiya</em> is Saccidananda—Existence, Consciousness, and Delight. It is here, in <em>turiya</em>, that a highly advanced seeker in the spiritual life or a spiritual Master can actually hear the soundless sound, ‘AUM’, the supreme secret of the Creator.</p>
<p>The supreme wealth of the Upanishads is the Self:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yato vaco nivartante aprapya manasa saha</em></p>
<p>Whence the words, the power of speech, come back with the mind baffled, the Goal unattained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Self cannot be won by mental brilliance. It can be won only with an aspiring heart and a dedicated life.</p>
<p>This Transcendental Self is covered here in the world of relativity by five distinct sheaths: <em>annamaya kosa</em>, the gross physical sheath; <em>pranamaya kosa</em>, the sheath of the vital force; <em>manomaya kosa</em>, the mental sheath; <em>vijña</em>nama/ya kosa/, the sheath of the advanced and developed knowledge; and anandamaya kosa, the sheath of Bliss.</p>
<p>There are three types of bodies corresponding to these five sheaths. These bodies are called <em>sthulasarira</em>, <em>suksmasarira</em>, and <em>karanasarira</em>. <em>Sthula</em> means ‘gross physical’, and <em>sarira</em> means ‘body’. Suksma means ‘subtle’, and karana means ‘causal’. The physical body, <em>sthulasarira</em>, comprises <em>annamaya kosa</em>, the material substance. <em>Suksmasarira</em>, the subtle body, comprises <em>pranamaya kosa</em>, <em>manomaya kosa</em> and <em>vijñanamaya kosa</em>. <em>Karanasarira</em>, the causal body, comprises <em>anandamaya kosa</em>, the sheath of Bliss.</p>
<p>On a dark and tenebrous night the glow-worms appear. They offer their light and feel that it is they who have chased the darkness away. After a while, the stars start shining, and the glow-worms realise their insufficient capacity. After some time the moon appears. When the moon appears, the stars see and feel how dim and insignificant their light is in comparison to the light of the moon. In a few hours the sun appears. When the sun appears, the joy and pride of the moon is also smashed. The sunlight chases away all darkness, and the light of the glow-worms, stars and moon pales into insignificance.</p>
<p>This is the planet sun. But each of us has an inner sun. This inner sun is infinitely more powerful, more beautiful, more illumining than the planet sun. When this sun dawns and shines, it destroys the darkness of millennia. This sun shines through Eternity. This inner sun is called the Self, the Transcendental Self. [fn:3]</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The revelation of India’s light</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The revelation of India’s light" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>University of California at Berkeley; Berkeley, California, USA</em><br /><em>7 November 1971</em></p>
<p>Each Upanishad is the unfoldment of the supreme knowledge which, once spiritually attained, is never lost. According to the Upanishads, the entire universe of action, with its ephemeral means and ends, lives in the meshes of ignorance. It is the knowledge of the supreme Self that can destroy the human ignorance of millennia and inundate the earth-consciousness with the Light and Delight of the ever-transcending and ever-manifesting Beyond.</p>
<p>As we have the heart, the mind, the vital, the body and the soul, so also the Upanishads have a heart, a mind, a vital, a body and a soul. The heart of the Upanishads is self-realisation, the mind of the Upanishads is self-revelation, the vital of the Upanishads is self-manifestation, the body of the Upanishads is self-transformation, and the soul of the Upanishads is self-perfection.</p>
<p>What is of paramount importance right now is self-realisation. For self-realisation we need only four things. First we need the help of the scriptures, then a guide, then yogic disciplines and, finally, the Grace of God. The scriptures tell the seeker, “Awake, arise! It is high time for you to get up. Sleep no more.” The spiritual Master tells the seeker, “My child, run! Run the fastest! I am inspiring you. I have already kindled the flame of aspiration within you. Now you can run the fastest.” Yogic disciplines tell the seeker, “You are practising the spiritual life, and I am giving you the result of your practices. I have made the road clear for you. Now you can run the fastest on a road that is empty of danger.” Then something more is required, and that is God’s Grace. One may run the fastest, but one may not reach the Goal even if there is no obstacle on the way, because human beings very often get tired. Before they reach the Goal they feel that they are totally exhausted. At that time what is required is God’s Grace. Without God’s Grace one cannot complete the journey. God’s Grace tells the seeker, “Lo, the Goal is won.”</p>
<p>To be sure, God’s Grace starts right from the beginning. When we study the scriptures, God’s Grace has already dawned on us. Had there been no Grace from God, we could not have launched into the spiritual path in the first place. And had there been no Grace from God, we could not have found our spiritual Master. It is out of His infinite Bounty that God brings a seeker to the Master. Then the seeker and the Master must play their respective roles. The Master will bring down God’s Compassion, but the seeker has to practise spiritual disciplines. His task is to aspire, and the Master’s task is to bring down Compassion.</p>
<p>In the inner world, one thing that everybody must have is aspiration. Here on earth the tree offers us an example of this aspiration. It remains on earth with its roots in the dirt, but its aim is to reach the Highest. We are afraid of staying on earth. We feel that if we stay on earth we cannot reach the Highest. But the tree shows us how absurd this is. Its root is under the ground, but its topmost branch is aspiring towards the Heavens. In the Upanishads we come across a tree called the asvattha tree. Unlike earthly trees, this tree has its roots above and its branches below. It has two types of branches. One type enters into the meshes of ignorance and then starts struggling, fighting and trying to come out again into the effulgence of Light. The other type of branch always tries to remain in the Light. Its movement is upward; its aspiration is upward.</p>
<p>Here on earth each human being has capacity. A human being sees ignorance within and without, but he has the capacity to remain beyond the boundaries of ignorance. How? Through aspiration. Why? Because he needs constant satisfaction. And it is aspiration alone that can give us this constant satisfaction. Why do we aspire? We aspire for delight,Ananda. Delight is self-creation and self-experience. Delight in the Highest, absolute Highest, is known as Anandapurusa. There the Delight is Infinity, Eternity, and Immortality. There is another type of delight which is called Anandatma, when from infinite Delight, Delight takes shape and form. In the earth-bound consciousness, delight is called Anandatma.</p>
<p>When Delight actually descends into the obscure, impure, unlit, imperfect nature of man to transform human nature, it finds constant resistance. Then we see that Delight loses its power because of teeming ignorance, and pleasure, short-lived pleasure, looms large. In the Highest, the triple consciousness — Saccidananda — Existence, Consciousness, and Delight go together. But when they want to manifest themselves, they have to do it only through Delight.</p>
<p>When Delight descends, the first rung that it steps on is called the Supermind. The Supermind is not something a little superior to the mind. No, it is infinitely higher than the mind. It is not ‘mind’ at all, although the word is used. It is the consciousness that has already transcended the limitations of the finite. There creation starts. Form begins one rung below. This rung is called the Overmind. Here form starts, multiplicity starts in an individual form. The next rung is the intuitive mind. With the intuitive mind we see multiplicity in a creative form. With intuition we see all at a glance. We can see many things at a time; we see collective form. From the intuitive mind, Delight enters into the mind proper. This mind sees each object separately. But although it sees everything separately, it does not try to doubt the existence of each object. Next, Delight enters into the physical mind — that is, the mind that is governed by the physical. This mind sees each object separately, plus it doubts the existence of each object. Real doubt starts here in the physical mind.</p>
<p>After it has descended through all the levels of the mind, Delight enters into the vital. In the vital we see the dynamic force or the aggressive force. The force that we see in the inner or subtle vital is dynamic, and the force that we see in the outer vital is aggressive. From the vital, Delight enters into the physical. There are two types of physical: the subtle physical and the physical proper. In the subtle physical, Delight is still descending, and we may still be conscious of it. But in the subtle physical we cannot possess or utilise the Truth; we can only see it, like a beggar looking at a multimillionaire. Finally, when we come to the gross physical, there is no Delight at all.</p>
<p>Delight descends, but we do not see even an iota of it in the gross physical. What can we do then? We can enter into the soul on the strength of our aspiration, and the soul will consciously take us to the highest plane, to Saccidananda — Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. At that time our journey can become conscious. We have entered into the triple consciousness, and we can begin descending consciously into the Supermind, the Overmind, the intuitive mind, the mind proper, the physical mind, the vital and the physical. When we are successful in the physical, that is to say, when we can bring down Delight from the highest plane and the physical can absorb and utilise this Delight, the life of pleasure ends. At that time we come to realise the difference between the life of pleasure and the life of Delight. The life of pleasure is followed by frustration and destruction. The life of Delight is a continuous growth, continuous fulfilment, continuous achievement and continuous God-manifestation in God’s own Way.</p>
<p>The <em>Mundaka Upanishad</em> has offered us two birds. One bird is seated on the top of the life-tree, the other on a branch below. The bird seated on the low branch eats both sweet and bitter fruits. Sweet fruits give the bird the feeling that life is pleasure; bitter fruits give the bird the feeling that life is misery. The other bird, seated on the top of the tree, eats neither the sweet fruit nor the bitter fruit. It just sits calmly and serenely. Its life is flooded with peace, light and delight. The bird that eats the sweet and bitter fruit on the tree of life is disappointed and disgusted; disappointed because pleasure is impermanent, ephemeral and fleeting; disgusted because frustration ends in destruction. Unmistakably disappointed and utterly disgusted, this bird flies up and loses itself in the freedom-light and perfection-delight of the bird at the top of the life-tree. The bird on the top of the tree is the Cosmic and Transcendental Self, and the bird below is the individual self. These two beautiful birds are known as Suparna.</p>
<p>In some of the Upanishads we see a continuous rivalry between the Cosmic Gods and the demons. The self-resplendent ones are the Gods; and the self-indulgent ones are the demons. The Gods and the demons are the descendents of Prajapati, the Creator. When the Gods win the victory, the light of the soul reigns supreme. When the demons win the victory, the night of the body reigns supreme. Originally the gods and the demons were the organs of Prajapati. The organs that were energised by the divine Will, illumined by the divine Light and inspired by the divine Action became Gods.</p>
<p>The organs that were instigated by the lower thoughts and were eager to live in the sense-world and enjoy pleasure-life, and were aiming at lesser and destructive goals, became demons. Needless to say, it is infinitely easier to reach the lesser goals than it is to reach the Goal Supreme. This is precisely why the demons greatly outnumbered the Gods. But we, the seekers of the infinite Light and Truth, need the quality of the Gods and not the quantity of the demons.</p>
<p>Once the Gods made a fervent request to the organ of speech, the nose, the eyes, the ears, the mind and the vital force to chant hymns for them. All sang successively. The demons immediately realised that the Gods would, without fail, gain supremacy over them through these chanters, so they secretly and successfully contaminated them with the blatant evil of strong attachment to sense objects and the life of pleasure. They immediately succeeded with the organ of speech, the nose, the eyes, the ears and the mind. But to the vital force they lost badly. The vital force broke them into pieces and threw them in all directions. The vital force won the victory for the Gods. Their existence was inundated with Divinity’s eternal Light. They became their true selves. The chicanery of the jealous demons was exposed, and their pride was smashed.</p>
<p>This vital force is called <em>ayasya angirasa</em>. It means ‘the essence of the limbs’. The vital force was victorious. It was also kind, sympathetic and generous:</p>
<p>The vital force carried the organ of speech beyond the domain of death. Having transcended the region of death, the organ of speech became fire, and this fire shines far beyond death.</p>
<p>The vital force carried the nose beyond death. The nose then became the air. Having transcended the boundaries of death, the air blows beyond death.</p>
<p>The vital force carried the eyes beyond death. The eyes became the sun. Having transcended the region of death, the sun perpetually shines.</p>
<p>The vital force carried the ears beyond death. They then became the directions. These directions, having transcended death, remained far beyond its domain.</p>
<p>The vital force carried the mind beyond death. The mind then became the moon. The moon, having transcended death, shines beyond its domain.</p>
<p>The <em>Brhadaranyaka</em>, or ‘great forest’ Upanishad, offers to humanity an unparalleled prayer:</p>

<p><em>Asato ma sad gamaya</em><br /><em>Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya</em><br /><em>Mrtyor mamrtam gamaya</em></p>
<p>Lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br /> Lead me from darkness unto Light.<br /> Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>

<p>The unreal is the frown of death; the Real is the song of Immortality. Darkness is the colossal pride of death; Light is the life of the illumining and perfecting power of Immortality. Death is the message of nothingness. Immortality is the message of humanity’s liberated oneness with Divinity’s Transcendental Height.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The beauty and duty of India’s soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The beauty and duty of India’s soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>New York University; New York, New York, USA</em><br /><em>17 November 1971</em></p>

<p>This beauty is not tempting.<br /> This beauty is illumining.</p>
<p>This duty is not self-imposed.<br /> This duty is God-ordained.</p>

<p>The Upanishads offer us self-knowledge, world-knowledge and God-knowledge. Self-knowledge is self-discovery. After self-discovery we have to feel that world-knowledge is within us, and we have to grow into world-knowledge. Then comes a time when we know the Possessor of world-knowledge, and then we have God-knowledge. We have to enter into God-knowledge, which is the Possessor of the universe.</p>
<p>“Neti, neti — Not this, not this,” or “Not this, not that” — is the message of the Upanishads. All of us here are seekers of the Infinite Truth. A real seeker is not and cannot be satisfied with his individual life, individual achievements, worldly possessions. No. He can be satisfied only when he has achieved the Absolute. Now what is the Absolute? Brahman is the Absolute.</p>
<p>The Seers of the hoary past offered this sublime knowledge: “Brahman cannot be limited by anything, Brahman cannot be housed by anything, Brahman cannot be defined by anything.” This was their assertion. But we feel that this is the negative way of seeing Brahman. There is a positive way, and this positive way is: “Brahman is Eternal, Brahman is Infinite, Brahman is Immortal. Brahman is beyond and beyond.” This is the positive way. We, the seekers of the Infinite Truth, will follow the positive way. If we follow the positive way in our life of aspiration, we can run the fastest and reach the Ultimate Goal sooner.</p>
<p>We have to see Brahman in the finite as we wish to see Brahman in the Infinite. But during our meditation, if we can have the vision of Brahman as the Infinite Self, then it becomes easier for us to enter into the world of relativity where we see everything as finite.</p>
<p>We see the world within us; we see the world without us. In the world within there is a being, and in the world without there is also a being. These two beings are called ‘non-being’ and ‘being’. From non-being, being came into existence. This very idea baffles our minds. How can non-being create being? Non-being is nothing. From nothing, how can something come into existence? But we have to know that it is the mind which tells us that from non-being being cannot come into existence. We have to know that this ‘nothing’ is actually something beyond the conception of the mind. ‘Nothing’ is the life of the everlasting Beyond. ‘Nothing’ is something that always remains beyond our mental conception. It transcends our limited consciousness. So when we think of the world or of being coming out of non-being, we have to feel that this Truth can be known and realised only on the strength of our inner aspiration, where the mind does not operate at all. It is intuition which grants us this boon of knowing that ‘nothing’ is the song of the ever-transcending Beyond, and ‘nothing’ is the experience of the ever-fulfilling, ever-transcending and ever-manifesting existence.</p>
<p>The Upanishads and the essence of <em>prana</em> are inseparable. <em>Prana</em> is a Sanskrit word. It can be translated into English in various ways. It may be called ‘breath’ or ‘energy’ or even ‘ether’. But <em>prana</em> is life-energy. This life-energy is not material, it is not physical, but it is something that maintains and sustains the physical body. The source of <em>prana</em> is the Supreme. In the field of manifestation, <em>prana</em> is indispensable. <em>Prana</em> is the soul of the universe.</p>
<p>In India, the term ‘/prana/’ has a special significance of its own. <em>Prana</em> is not just breath. Daily we breathe in and out thousands of times without paying any attention. But when we use the term ‘/prana/’, we think of the life-energy that is flowing within and without in our breath.</p>
<p><em>Prana</em> is divided into five parts: <em>prana</em>, <em>apana</em>, <em>samana</em>, <em>vyana</em>, and <em>udana</em>. The life-energy, life-force, that is inside the physical eyes, nose and ears, we call <em>prana</em>.</p>
<p>The life-energy in our organs of excretion and generation is <em>Prana</em>. <em>Samana</em> is the life-energy that governs our digestion and assimilation. In the lotus of the heart, where the Self is located, there we see one hundred and one subtle spiritual nerves, and in each nerve one hundred nerve branches, and from each nerve branch seventy-two thousand nerve branches. There the <em>prana</em> that moves is called <em>vyana</em>. Through the centre of the spine, life-energy flows. When it goes upward it reaches the Highest and, when it goes downward, it reaches the lowest. When a seeker of the infinite Truth leaves the body, his <em>prana</em> rises towards the Highest and, when a sinful person leaves the body, his <em>prana</em> goes downward. This <em>prana</em> which flows through the centre of the spine is called <em>udana</em>.</p>
<p>When we are in a position to enter into the cosmos with the help of our life-force, we feel that the Beyond is not in our imagination. It is not a chimerical mist; it is a reality that is growing within us and for us. God was One. He wanted to be many. Why? He felt the necessity of enjoying Himself divinely and supremely in infinite forms. “Ekam aiksata bahu syam — One desiring to be many,” was His inner feeling.</p>
<p>When the Supreme projected His Life-Energy, He saw two creatures immediately. One was male, the other female. <em>Prana</em>, the life-force, is the male, and the female is <em>rayi</em>. <em>Prana</em> is the sun. Rayi is the moon. From <em>prana</em> and <em>rayi</em> we all came into existence. Again, <em>prana</em> is spirit and <em>rayi</em> is matter. Spirit and matter must go together. Spirit needs matter for its self-manifestation, and matter needs spirit for its self-realisation.</p>
<p>Very often the Vedic and Upanishadic Seers used two words: <em>nama</em> and <em>rupa</em>. <em>Nama</em> is name; <em>rupa</em> is form. In our outer world we deal with name and form. In the inner world we deal with the nameless and the formless. The name and the nameless are not rivals. The form and the formless are not rivals. The name embodies the capacity of the outer body. The nameless reveals the Immortality of the soul. In form, the Cosmic Consciousness manifests itself by circumscribing itself. In the formless, the Cosmic Consciousness transcends itself by expanding and enlarging itself.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, the term ‘sacrifice’ is often used. The Vedic Seers spoke elaborately on sacrifice. According to them, the horse sacrifice, asvamedha sacrifice, was most important. The <em>Brhadaranyaka Upanishad</em> starts with the sacrificial horse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Usa va asvasya medhyasya sirah…</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aum. The head of the sacrificial horse is verily the dawn, the eye of the sacrificial horse is the sun, the vital force the air, the open mouth the fire named vaisvanara, the trunk the year, the back Heaven, the belly the sky, the hoof the earth, the flanks the four directions, the ribs the intermediate directions, the limbs the seasons, the joints the months and fortnights, the feet the days and nights, the bones the stars, the flesh the clouds, the half-digested food (in the stomach) the sands, the arteries and veins the rivers, the liver and spleen the mountains, the hairs the herbs and trees, the forepart the rising sun, the hind part the setting sun. Its yawn is lightning, its shaking body is thunder, its making water is rain, its neighing is, indeed, speech.</p>
<p>Why did the Upanishadic Seers, the Vedic Seers, speak of the horse and not any other animal as the symbol of sacrifice? They realised the speed of the horse, the dynamism of the horse, the faithful and devoted qualities of the horse. Speed is necessary, dynamism is necessary, faithfulness and devotedness are necessary to realise and reveal the Absolute. That is why they chose the horse for the religious rites and for help in their inner awakening.</p>
<p>Just by sacrificing a horse we cannot gain any divine merit. Far from it. We must meditate on the horse, on the qualities of the horse, and invoke these divine qualities to enter into us from Above. The Vedic and Upanishadic Seers did this. They succeeded in getting the divine qualities from the horse, and the result was that they entered into Brahmaloka, the highest Heaven.</p>
<p>But even in the highest Heaven, the Delight we get is not everlasting. For everlasting Delight we have to enter into the Brahman on the strength of our inner cry. When we have the inner cry, we can eventually enter into the Brahman and there get everlasting Delight.</p>
<p>To come back to the horse, one has not to make a horse sacrifice in this age. But one has to see the qualities of the horse and inwardly meditate on the divinely fulfilling qualities of the horse. It is from one’s own concentration and meditation that one will get the qualities which the horse offers or represents. Very often people misunderstand the idea of sacrifice, especially Westerners. They cannot understand how one can gain any divine merit just by killing a horse. They think it is absurd. But sacrifice is not in killing. Sacrifice is in becoming one with the consciousness of the horse. When we do this, only then can we get the divine wealth from Above. We need not, we must not kill the horse at all.</p>
<p>To be sure, there can be no sacrifice without aspiration. At every moment aspiration is necessary. But this aspiration has to be genuine and has to come from the very depths of the heart. It cannot give us realisation if it is not genuine. Aspiration does not know how to pull or push. Restlessness and aspiration can never go together. Very often beginners think that if they aspire they have to be very dynamic. This is true. But we do not see dynamism in their aspiration. What we see is restlessness. They want to realise God overnight. If we take this restlessness as determination or dynamism, then we are totally mistaken.</p>
<p>May I repeat an oft-quoted story? A seeker went to a spiritual Master. He was properly initiated and, in a few days’ time, this seeker said to the Master, “Master, now that you have initiated me, please give me God-realisation.” The Master said, “You have to practise meditation for a long time.” After a few days the disciple again said, “Master, Master, give me realisation, please give me realisation.” He bothered the Master for a long time.</p>
<p>One day the Master asked him to follow him. The Master went to the Ganges for a dip and invited the disciple also to enter the water. When the disciple was neck-deep in water, the Master pushed his head underwater and held it there. When the Master finally let the struggling disciple come up, he asked him, “What did you feel while you were underwater?” The disciple replied, “O Master, I felt that I would die if I did not get a breath of air.” The Master said, “You will realise God on the day you feel that you will die if He does not come and give you life. If you sincerely feel that you will die without God, if you can cry for Him in that way, then you are bound to realise Him.”</p>
<p>The Master offered this Truth to the disciple. Unfortunately, we very often see that when a Master offers the Truth, the disciples misunderstand. They understand it according to their limited light, or they feel that the message the Master has given is totally wrong. Now if the Truth that is offered by the Master is not properly understood and used, then in the field of manifestation the disciple, the seeker, will never be fulfilled. The highest Truth will always remain a far cry for him.</p>
<p>In the Upanishads, Indra and Virochana went to Prajapati for the highest Knowledge. Indra represented the Gods, and Virochana represented the demons. When Prajapati offered them the knowledge of Brahman, Indra went back again and again to verify the knowledge he had received, and he finally did realise the highest Knowledge. But Virochana understood the truth in his own way and did not feel the necessity of going back again and again to realise the highest Truth.</p>
<p>There are quite a few spiritual Masters on earth who are offering their light to the seekers, but the seekers unfortunately do not understand the message of Truth which they offer. How can they understand the message, the meaning, the significance of the Truth which the Master offers? They can do it only on the strength of their devotion — devotion to the cause, and devotion to the Master. If they have a devoted feeling towards their Master and towards the cause of Self-realisation, then the Truth can be realised in the way the Truth has to be realised and the message that the Master offers to chase away ignorance not only can be properly understood, but also can be established in the earth atmosphere. When Truth is permanently established here on earth, man will receive the garland of eternal Victory.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Glimpses from the Vedas and the Upanishads</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Glimpses from the Vedas and the Upanishads" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Fairleigh Dickinson University; Teaneck, New Jersey, USA</em><br /><em>30 November 1971</em></p>

<p><em>Nalpe sukham asti bhumaiva sukham</em></p>
<p>In the finite there is no happiness.<br /> The Infinite alone is happiness.</p>

<p>Anything that is finite cannot embody happiness, not to speak of lasting Delight. The finite embodies pleasure, which is not true happiness. The Infinite embodies true, divine happiness in infinite measure and, at the same time, it reveals and offers to the world at large its own Truth, its own Wealth.</p>
<p>The Infinite expresses itself in infinite forms and infinite shapes here in the world of multiplicity; and again this Infinite enjoys itself in a divine and supreme manner in the highest Transcendental Plane of its own Consciousness. The Infinite here in the world of multiplicity expresses itself in three major forms: Creation is the first aspect of the Infinite. The second aspect is preservation. The third aspect is dissolution or destruction.</p>
<p>These terms — ‘creation’, ‘preservation’ and ‘destruction’ — are philosophical and religious terms. From the spiritual point of view, creation existed, does exist, and is being preserved. When we use the term ‘destruction’, we have to be very careful. There is no such thing as destruction in the Supreme’s inner Vision — it is nothing but transformation. When we lose our desires, we feel that they have been destroyed; but they have not been destroyed — they have only been transformed into a larger vision which is aspiration. We started our journey with desire, but when we launched into the spiritual path, desire gave way to aspiration. The unlit consciousness, which we see in the form of desire, can be transformed and will be transformed by the aspiration within us. What, with our limited knowledge and vision, we call destruction, from the spiritual point of view is the transformation of our unlit, impure, obscure nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ekam evadvitiyam</em></p>
<p>Only the One, without a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this One we came into existence and, at the end of our journey’s close, we have to return to the Absolute One. This is the soul’s journey. If we take it as an outer journey, then we are mistaken. In our outer journey we have a starting point and a final destination. It may take a few years or many years for us to reach our destined goal, but the starting point is at one place and the destination is somewhere else. But the inner journey is not a journey as such, with the origin here and the Goal elsewhere. In our inner journey we go deep within and discover our own Reality, our own forgotten Self.</p>
<p>How do we discover our forgotten Self? We do it through meditation. There are various types of meditation: simple meditation, which everybody knows; deep meditation, which the spiritual seeker knows; and higher or highest meditation, which is the meditation of the soul, in the soul, with the soul, for the entire being. When an ordinary seeker meditates, he meditates in the mind. If he is a little advanced, he meditates in the heart. If he is far advanced in the spiritual life, he can meditate in the soul and with the help of the soul for the manifestation of Divinity in humanity.</p>
<p>Spiritual Masters meditate in the physical, in the vital, in the mind, in the heart and in the souls of their disciples. These Masters also meditate all at once on the Infinite, the Eternal and the Immortal. These are not vague terms to the real spiritual Masters. They are dynamic Realities, for in their inner consciousness real spiritual Masters swim in the sea of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. They can easily concentrate, meditate and contemplate on these three divine Realities which represent the Absolute.</p>
<p>The Upanishads have come into existence from four Vedas: the <em>Rig Veda</em>, the <em>Sama Veda</em>, the <em>Yajur Veda</em>, and the <em>Atharva Veda</em>. Each Veda has something unique to offer to mankind. The first and most famous Veda is the <em>Rig Veda</em>. It starts with a Cosmic God, Agni, the Fire God. Fire means aspiration. Aspiration and the message of the Vedas are inseparable. This fire is the fire of inner awakening and inner mounting flame. It has no smoke in it. This fire does not burn anything; it only illumines and elevates our consciousness. The Fire God is the only Cosmic God who is a Brahmin.</p>
<p>Agni, fire, expresses itself in seven forms and it has seven significant inner names: <em>Kali</em> the black; <em>Karali</em> the terrible, <em>Manojava</em>, thought-swift; <em>Sulohita</em> blood-red; <em>Sudhumravarna</em>, smoke-hued; <em>Sphulingini</em>, scattering sparks; <em>Visva-ruci</em>, the all-beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Kali</em>, the black, is not actually black. <em>Kali</em> is the divine force or fire within us which fights against undivine hostile forces. Mother Kali fights against demons in the battlefield of life. In the vital plane we see Her as a dark, tenebrous Goddess but, in the highest plane of consciousness, She is golden. We see Her terrible form when She fights against hostile forces, but She is the Mother of Compassion. We misunderstand Her dynamic qualities — we take them as aggressive qualities. Mother Kali has compassion in boundless measure but, at the same time, she will not tolerate any sloth, imperfection, ignorance or lethargy in the seeker. Finally, Mother Kali is beauty unparalleled. This beauty is not physical beauty. This beauty is inner beauty, which elevates human consciousness to the highest plane of Delight.</p>
<p>The <em>Sama Veda</em> offers us God’s music, the soul’s music. In addition, it offers India’s religion, India’s philosophy and India’s politics. All these striking achievements of India have come from the <em>Sama Veda</em>. Music is of paramount importance in the <em>Sama Veda</em>. It is not at all like modern music; it is the real, soul-stirring music. The greatest sage of the past, Yajñavalkya, said, “The abode of music is Heaven.” It is the <em>Sama Veda</em> which holds this Heavenly music—the soul-stirring, life-energising music.</p>
<p>Most of you have read the Bhagavad Gita, the Song Celestial of Lord Krishna. There Lord Krishna says, “I am the <em>Sama Veda</em>.” He does not say that he is the <em>Rig Veda</em> or the <em>Yajur Veda</em> or the <em>Atharva Veda</em>. No, he says that he is the <em>Sama Veda</em>. Why? Because in the <em>Sama Veda</em> Lord Krishna found the soul’s music, which is his very own. A great Indian philosopher-saint, Patañjali, begins his philosophy with the <em>Sama Veda</em> precisely because of its inner music. If music is taken away from God’s Creation, then it will be an empty Creation. God the Creator is the Supreme Musician, and His Creation is His only Delight. It is in His music that God feels Delight, and it is through music that He offers Himself to His aspiring and unaspiring children.</p>
<p>From the <em>Sama Veda</em> we get the most significant Upanishad, the <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em>. This Upanishad is equal to the <em>Brhadaranyaka Upanishad</em>. It is by far the largest in size and, according to many, it is not only the largest but also the best. Again, there are those who are of the opinion that the Isa Upanishad, which is tiny, very tiny, is the best — not because of its size, but because of its depth. Some will say the <em>Svetasvatara</em> or <em>Katha</em> or <em>Kena Upanishad</em> is the best. Each one has to express his sincere feeling about the essence of a particular Upanishad.</p>
<p>The <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em>, which derives from the <em>Sama Veda</em>, says something most significant to the sincere seekers. One question which spiritual Teachers are very often asked is, “Why do we need a Teacher? Can we not realise God by ourselves?” In the <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> there is a specific way of convincing the doubters and the unaspiring human beings who argue for the sake of argument.</p>
<p>The <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> says: Think of yourself as a traveller. You have lost your way, and a robber attacks you. He takes away all your wealth, and binds your eyes. Then he takes you to a faraway place and leaves you there. Originally you had vision, and you were able to move around, but now your fate is deplorable. You cannot see, you cannot walk, you are crying like a helpless child, but there is no rescue.</p>
<p>Now suppose someone comes and unties your eyes and goes away. You will then be able to see the paths all around you, but you will not know which one is the right one for you and, even if you did, you would not be able to walk on it because your legs and arms are still bound. This is the condition of the seeker who wants to realise God by himself. Now suppose someone comes, unties you completely, and shows you which path will take you home. This person has really done you a favour. If you have faith in him and confidence in yourself, then you will reach your Destination swiftly and surely. If you have faith in him, but do not have confidence in your own capacity to reach the Goal, then he will go along to help you. The same Teacher who freed you from blindness and showed you the path will go with you, inside you, to inspire you. He will act as your own aspiration to lead you towards your Destined Goal.</p>
<p>If you get this kind of help from a spiritual Master, then your life can be of significance, your life can bear fruit, and you can run the fastest towards the Goal. Otherwise, you will walk today on this path, tomorrow on that path, and the following day on some other path. You may have the capacity to walk, but you will come back again and again to your starting point, frustrated and disappointed. Along with capacity, if you know the right path and have a true Master to help you, who can prevent you from reaching your Destined Goal? Once you reach your Destined Goal, you reach God’s Heights and start manifesting God’s Light here on earth. You are fulfilled — fulfilled multiplicity in Unity’s embrace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The crown of India’s soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The crown of India’s soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Harvard University; Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA</em><br /><em>3 December 1971</em></p>
<p>In the silent recesses of the Upanishadic heart, we see and feel a splendid combination of the soul’s spirituality and life’s practicality. In the world of imagination, in the world of aspiration, in the world of realisation, in the world of revelation and in the world of manifestation, the soul of the Upanishads has the divine effrontery to assume the sovereign leadership, because that is its natural role. Its understanding embraces all the foibles of weak humanity. Its universal love is the song of self-offering.</p>
<p>The Upanishads are at once the heart’s aspiration-cry and the soul’s experience-smile. They have the vision of Unity in multiplicity. They are the manifesation of multiplicity in Unity.</p>
<p>The message of the Upanishads is the life divine, the life of transformed humanity and the life of an illumined earth-consciousness. The Upanishads tell us that the renunciation of desire-life is the fulfilling enjoyment of world-existence. This renunciation is neither self-denial nor self-rejection. This renunciation demands the transcendence of ego to breathe in freely the life-energy of the soul and yet to live a dynamic and active life in the world where one can achieve Infinity’s Height, Eternity’s Delight and Immortality’s Light.</p>
<p>Each major Upanishad is a pathfinder in the forest of experience that comprises human life. Each major Upanishad offers us the intuitive knowledge and the inner courage to find our way through the labyrinth of curves and dead ends, doubts and subterfuges. We come to realise that life is a glorious adventure of the aspiring heart, searching mind, struggling vital and unsleeping body. We explore the hidden places of illumining individuality and fulfilling personality. Gone is our mind’s obscurity. Gone is our heart’s poverty. Gone is our vital’s impurity. Gone is our body’s insincerity. The train of Light has arrived. The plane of Delight is come.</p>
<p>The Upanishads teach the seeker that Delight is the manifestation of divine Love, Consciousness is the manifestation of the soul-force, and Existence is the manifestation of Being. In Delight, Brahman is Reality. In Love, Brahman is Divinity. In Consciousness, Brahman contemplates on the Vision of perfect Perfection. In the soul-force, Brahman becomes the achievement of perfect Perfection. In Existence, Brahman is the Eternal Lover. In Being, Brahman is the Eternal Beloved.</p>
<p>For God-realisation we need a Guru. The <em>Katha Upanishad</em> says, “A seeker cannot find his way to God unless he is told of God by another.” The <em>Mundaka Upanishad</em> says, “A seeker must approach a Self-knower for his inner Illumination.” The <em>Prasna Upanishad</em> says, “O Father, you have carried us over to the Golden Shores.” The <em>Katha Upanishad</em> says, “Arise, awake! Listen to and follow the great ones.” The <em>Mundaka Upanishad</em> says, “A Guru is he whose outer knowledge is the Veda and whose inner knowledge is the contemplation of Brahman.”</p>
<p>A seeker who studies the Upanishads and leads a life of self-enquiry and self-discipline is not and cannot be a mere player on the stage of life, but is rather a spiritual art director and a real, divine producer. Further, he has two broad shoulders and does not mind the burdens of the world. He feels that it is his obligation to assuage the bleeding heart of humanity. His life is the independence of thought and spirit. His heart’s dedicated service receives rich rewards from Above. He has mastered his own philosophy of life, which is to please Divinity in humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taccaksur devahitam sukram</em> <em>uccarat pasyema saradah satam</em></p>
<p>May we, for a hundred autumns, see that lustrous Eye, God-ordained, arise before us…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To live for a hundred years is not just to drag out our existence here on earth. One has to fight against ignorance. Desultory efforts cannot carry us to God. It takes time to realise God. It takes more time to reveal God. It takes even more time to manifest God. That is why the Seers of the Vedas prayed for sound health and long life, a life beyond a hundred autumns. They also warned us that anything that is deleterious to our health has to be avoided.</p>

<p><em>Uru nas tanve tan</em><br /><em>Uru ksayaya nas krdhi</em><br /><em>Uru no yamdhi jivase</em></p>
<p>For our body give us freedom.<br /> For our dwelling give us freedom.<br /> For our life give us freedom.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda, the great Vedantin of indomitable courage, voiced forth, “Freedom — physical freedom, mental freedom and spiritual freedom — is the watchword of the Upanishads.”</p>
<p>In order to achieve freedom, we need energy, power and spirit. And for that, here is the mightiest prayer:</p>

<p><em>Tejo ’si tejo mayi dhehi</em><br /><em>Viryam asi viryam mayi dhehi</em><br /><em>Balam asi balam mayi dhehi</em><br /><em>Ojo ’si ojo mayi dhehi</em><br /><em>Manyur asi manyur mayi dhehi</em><br /><em>Saho ’si saho mayi dhehi</em></p>
<p>Thy fiery spirit I invoke.<br /> Thy manly vigour I invoke.<br /> Thy power and energy I invoke.<br /> Thy battle fury I invoke.<br /> Thy conquering mind I invoke.</p>

<p>The Upanishads always hold the intrepid view of life. Progress, constant progress, is the characteristic of the Vedic and Upanishadic age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prehi abhihi dhrsnuhi</em> Go forward, fear not, fight!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fight against what? Bondage, ignorance and death. Life is ours. Victory must needs be ours, too. Anything that stands in the seeker’s way has to be thrown side without hesitation. His is the life that knows no compromise.</p>
<p>The main longing of the Upanishads is for the Ultimate Truth. This Truth can be achieved by a genuine seeker who has many divine qualities and whose love of God preponderates over every other love. The seeker needs three things: <em>vrata</em>, self-dedication; <em>krpa</em>, grace; and <em>sraddha</em>, faith. These three qualities embodied, <em>satya</em>, Truth, is unmistakably attained.</p>
<p>Who wants to remain alone? No one, not even the highest, the first-born, Virat. There came a time when He felt the need of projecting the Cosmic Gods. He projected the Fire God, Agni, the only Brahmin God, from His mouth. Indra, Varuna, Yama, Isana and others were projected from His arms. These are the Kshatriya Gods. Then He projected the Vasus, the Rudras, the Maruts and others from His thighs. These are the Vaishya Gods. He projected Pusan from His feet. Pushan is the Shudra God.</p>
<p>A Brahmin embodies knowledge. A Kshatriya embodies strength. A Vaishya embodies prosperity. A Shudra embodies the secret of self-dedication. These four brothers are the limbs of the Cosmic Being. Although they are outwardly distinguishable by their quality and capacity, in spirit they are inseparably one.</p>
<p>Brahman, or the Supreme Self, is the greatest discovery of the Upanishads. No human soul knows or will ever know when ignorance entered into us, for earth-bound time itself is the creation of ignorance. Still, a man swimming in the sea of ignorance need not drown. The Seers of the hoary past, the knowers of the Brahman, in unmistakable terms tell us that all human beings can and must come out of the shackles of ignorance. The knowers of the Transcendental Truth also tell us that the individual soul is, in reality, identical with the Supreme Self. The only problem is that the individual does not remember his true Transcendental Nature. Finally, they tell us that “to know the Self is to become the Self.” On the strength of his direct realisation, a knower of the Brahman declares, “/Aham Brahmasmi/ — I am Brahman.”</p>
<p>In concluding this talk on the Upanishads, “The Crown of India’s Soul,” my realisation declares that the mind-power, the heart-power and the soul-power of the Upanishadic consciousness are boundless. In the realm of philosophy, Shankara embodies the mind-power; in the realm of dynamic spirituality, Ramana Maharshi, the great sage of Arunachala, embodies the mind-power. The Christ, the Buddha and Sri Chaitanya of Nadia, Bengal, embody the heart-power. Sri Krishna and Sri Ramakrishna embody the soul-power. In Sri Aurobindo the vision of the mind-power reached its zenith, and the realisation of the soul-power found its fulfilling manifestation on earth. These spiritual giants and others are steering the life-boat of humanity towards the Transcendental Abode of the Supreme.</p>
