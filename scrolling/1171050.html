<h2>Before the <em>Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart</em> programme</h2>

<p>In my heart-garden today I am seeing a few most beautiful and most soulful flowers. I cannot go to Yugoslavia, but Yugoslavia’s soul and heart have come to me. And for that, my heart’s boundless love and gratitude and my soul’s infinite blessings and compassion I am offering to my spiritual children who are now here from Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>From this moment on, I shall grow in the very depths of your aspiration-heart every day, and every moment the beauty and fragrance of your hearts will please our Lord Beloved Supreme. I am extremely happy to have you all in our boat, the Golden Boat. And this boat will without fail carry all of us to the Golden Shore.</p>
<p>Once more, to each of you my heart of love and my life of gratitude I am offering.</p>

 <p>
SCA 581-585. On 18 January 1990 in Athens, Sri Chinmoy invited questions from the large group of his Yugoslavian disciples who had made the trip to Greece to see their spiritual Master for the very first time.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we avoid criticising someone?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Always we have to see what happens to us when others criticise us. It is like two boxers fighting. I am a boxer and somebody else is a boxer. When I criticise someone, it is like hitting them and hurting them. And when they criticise me, they are hurting me by making me feel sad. If we can remember how we feel when we are criticised, then we can sympathise with others. If we do not like being attacked by others, why should we attack them? Try to think of others as flowers. Feel that you are entering into a garden. You can enjoy the beauty of the flowers, or again, you can destroy the petals one by one. If you criticise others, you are destroying the flowers. What kind of beauty, purity and other divine qualities will you find in the garden when all the flowers are destroyed?</p>
<p>How can you prove to the world that you are very wise if you are constantly criticising others? Anything that helps you in your spiritual life, you have to do as often as possible, and anything that does not help you, you have to give up. Before you came to the spiritual life, you did many undivine things. When you enter into the spiritual life, it means that you are ready to give up those bad qualities. When you are eager and willing to do the right thing, automatically the bad qualities will leave you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to be very just, impartial, simply look at one part of your body. You have two eyes, but for some reason you like your right eye more. Perhaps your right eye has better vision than your left eye. So what do you do? You immediately establish your oneness with the left eye as well. Again, your left arm is weaker than your right arm. But you do not chop it off for that reason! It is also yours, just as your right arm is yours. You have identified yourself with the weaker parts as well as the stronger parts of your body.</p>
<p>When you see that somebody is not perfect, your heart has to come forward and say that the person who is imperfect is also part and parcel of your life. Always we have to be very, very wise. Our sisters and brothers who are weaker can be made stronger by our concern, compassion and sympathy. Otherwise, if we disregard the weaker ones, we will not be in the picture either! Who is good, who is bad? Just because I can say that one person is imperfect, I cannot say that I am perfect. Why should God tolerate me if I cannot tolerate others?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: There are disciples who are faithful to you, but they do not believe in God.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: There are disciples who are faithful to you, but they do not believe in God." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are here inside a hall. Before we enter into this hall, we can have any opinion about it. Somebody will say this hall can be illumined and somebody else will say this hall is all darkness. Then you become the judge. You come into the hall to see if there is light or if it is all dark. If it is all light, it is up to you to remain in this hall or leave. When people are well-educated in the mind, it is difficult for them to feel something inside their heart because they are using their mind too much. The mind immediately starts doubting. If someone says I am a very bad person, I think perhaps it is true. I may be a very good person, but the moment you say I am not good, I start doubting my own good qualities.</p>
<p>But if I feel deep inside my heart that I am a good person, then no matter what anyone says, even if twenty people say that I am a bad person, I will not believe them because my heart is telling me that I am a good person. I know that I have done many good things in this life. My mind can tell me twenty times that I am a good person, but still I do not believe my mind. I say, “Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not true.”</p>
<p>These people who are using their mind say they do not believe in God. But I wish to say that they do believe in something. For us God is all Love, all Compassion, all Forgiveness. At this moment, if their father or mother is dying, they will say, “Please save them.” They will ask someone to help. They may not use the term ‘God’, but at that time they are praying to God for help. The One they do not know is God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindly imagine a large swimming pool with many people swimming. When you see the people swimming in it, immediately you jump in. But when you are alone in front of the swimming pool, you become afraid. You are afraid that if something happens, no one will be there to save you. At home when you meditate, you have to think of the Centre when other people are meditating. Then you will be able to throw yourself into your meditation without any fear.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not good to leave your son and family. What you have to do is become very strong inwardly. Just because you cannot meditate at home right now, you must not leave your son and family. If you move, you will only think of your son. You will wonder what he is doing, what he is eating and so on. Wherever you go, you will carry the same mind. It is the mind that is not allowing you to meditate.</p>
<p>What you should do is to live in the heart. While looking at your son or talking to him or the members of your family, inwardly repeat “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme”. Try to inwardly repeat the name of the Supreme as often as possible. Then the vibration from this soulful chanting will enter into your son. I strongly feel that if you go away, it will be worse for both you and your son. You should be there with him. If you cannot pray and meditate most intensely to your satisfaction, you can say “Supreme”.</p>

<h2>A farewell to Yugoslavian disciples</h2>

<p>Soon you will be leaving Athens. Your so-called physical existence will leave this hotel and return to Yugoslavia, but your inner existence, which is real, absolutely real, which is the only reality, you will leave behind inside the depths of my heart. It will remain with me permanently. Physically I may not be able to go to your country in the near future, but spiritually I am already there. My heart of boundless love, infinite affection and inseparable oneness is all for you who have come from the aspiring heart and dedicated life of Yugoslavia. Those who have joined our boat have a very special significance in the depths of my own aspiring heart. In the short span of two days you have proved in unmistakable terms your sincere, most sincere cry for our Lord Beloved Supreme. My prayerful life and blessingful soul will always lead you and guide you to the highest Destination.</p>
<p>As in a school there are some good students and some students who are not as good, in the spiritual life there are also some good students and some poor students. I wish all of you to make a bold attempt to become excellent students of our Lord Beloved Supreme. I would like all of you to run the fastest. The things that are unnecessary and unaspiring, the things that may lead you to stray from the spiritual path, please, please, please, even in your wildest dreams, do not encourage or cherish. Run the fastest.</p>
<p>Very special Blessings you have from our Lord Supreme, my dearest Yugoslavian children. Anything that will stand in your way, anything that will delay your progress, please discard it consciously and immediately. The goal is for the brave and the swift. Those who can run the fastest in the spiritual life will get the highest reward. Therefore, at every moment, consciously, soulfully, devotedly and self-givingly, try to run the fastest and thus make our Lord Beloved Supreme extremely, extremely proud of you.</p>
<p>Since we are all seekers, we <em>do</em> believe in the existence of the soul. The soul flies in the firmament of Infinity, sleeplessly and eternally, like a bird. Birds symbolise the soul, the celestial soul. Let us all grow into most beautiful and dynamic souls, so that we can, at every moment, fly in the heart of Infinity’s Sky.</p>

 <p>
SCA 587-597. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 31 January 1990 at P.S. 86 in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: The hostile forces seem to be increasing and making progress, and the good forces seem to be losing strength. How is it possible that the good forces will ever win?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who are we to say which are the hostile forces, which are the good forces and who is winning? We use the term ‘hostile forces’, but do we actually know which are the hostile forces and which are the good forces? We ourselves can play the role of hostile forces most perfectly. Let us try, consciously and soulfully, to minimise our wrong actions. Each day if we can do one less wrong action, we help the divine within us to make us perfect. Since God has not given up on us, we must continue to try. As He has infinite Patience, let us also have patience in conquering wrong forces.</p>
<p>We must not add to God’s problems. Unconsciously we do many wrong things; for those, we have to forgive ourselves. But consciously also we do many wrong things. We look around and see that someone has done something and God has forgiven him, so we think, “I can do the same thing and God will also forgive me.” Is there any human being who every day is not consciously doing wrong things for no other reason than to fulfil a kind of desire, specially in the thought world? Insecurity comes, jealousy comes, inferiority and superiority come and we allow them to enter. We just connive at them. If we do not conquer these wrong forces, if we do not fight against them, we will surrender to them. We have to be all the time like brave soldiers or heroes to conquer them once and for all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In your New Year’s Message you mentioned in the last two lines &#039;My Transcendental Silence-Crown and my Universal Sound-Throne&#039;. Can you say something about that?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In your New Year’s Message you mentioned in the last two lines &#039;My Transcendental Silence-Crown and my Universal Sound-Throne&#039;. Can you say something about that?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is not my poetical expression; it is my own inner experience. If you can raise your consciousness, your inner height, then you will see that my New Year’s Message is not mental jugglery. Last year when I said certain things in the message, they came true. This year also they will happen. Every day tremendous things are happening in the inner world. In the inner world when we see a bud of beauty, then we know it will blossom, petal by petal. But unless it is fully blossomed outwardly, with our outer vision we cannot call it a flower. So in the inner world, if we have confidence or faith, we can see the inner reality. But if we cherish doubt, then we cannot see what is really most beautiful and most real. The doubting and practical mind does not perceive it. Most of the time when something is in seed form in the inner world, we see that it will eventually manifest fully. Very developed spiritual seekers can envision the future with their third eye. They know that their vision is real. It has already taken place in the inner world, but it is not showing on the outer plane.</p>
<p>Only eleven more months remain in this year. So let us have patience. With our aspiration and eagerness, we can also expedite God’s absolute Height. Our receptivity is nothing other than gratitude. As soon as we can offer an iota of gratitude to God, our receptivity increases.</p>
<p>God is pleased even with our short-lived surrender-life and infinitely shorter-lived gratitude-breath. We see how little gratitude we have. But when we increase our power of receptivity, the vision of tomorrow can be manifested as reality in today’s heart, in today’s life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can just shed tears — and I do not mean crocodile tears — you will develop discrimination-power. Try to feel that you are absolutely helpless, like a babe in the woods. You have to bring forward humility and feel that you are nothing and can be nothing without God’s Protection, God’s Compassion. You have to cry like a child. Think of the way a child cries for the mother’s milk or a toy. Then immediately you will be able to discriminate and choose only the things that are going to help you make spiritual progress. What you need will be there. The power of discrimination comes from our utmost sincere cry. If you use the mind to discriminate, it will be a mistake. Discrimination is founded upon the heart’s purest cry. Immediately God’s Compassion and Protection will give you nectar and keep you away from poison.</p>
<p>The other way is to act like a hero. Here you have to have the confidence to know that you are God’s supremely chosen child. With this confidence, you will conquer wrong forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My father committed suicide eleven years ago and it still disturbs me. He had cancer and had three months to live, so he took his life.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: My father committed suicide eleven years ago and it still disturbs me. He had cancer and had three months to live, so he took his life." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to my inner philosophy, God has given us this life. At every moment we must avail ourselves of the opportunity to fight against death. You can say your father’s life was useless. Even if he stayed, perhaps he would not have been able to contribute anything to the outer world. But there is an inner world, the soul’s world. The soul may no longer be able to manifest in and through a particular body, but it can manifest through the near and dear ones. In this way, it keeps a connection with the earth. Like this, there are so many reasons why one should not commit suicide.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, spiritual Masters may leave their physical body because they know that God’s choice Hour has come for them. It is God’s Will. But for ordinary people, it is the worst possible inner crime. In the case of your father, he has departed, but you are still here on earth. You can pray to God for forgiveness for your father. The dear ones remaining on earth can pray to God.</p>
<p>At the end of your life, even if you are only moving at the speed of an Indian bullock cart, God is still achieving something in and through your life. Do not take a wrong turn by committing suicide. If you discard this life, how can there be any progress? Suicide is the worst possible experience, not only for the one who commits suicide but also for his family members. Anyone who has close connections with that individual suffers tremendously. If your brother or father or sister or someone else commits suicide, then some of your subtle nerves, which are absolutely necessary for God-realisation, can be damaged. So you have to pray for your own protection as well. When somebody breaks the cosmic law in the family, for example, if your brother has gone to jail, then something very sacred in you or in one of your inner beings will snap. Again, if your family members do something good or great for humanity, it affects you also. So we have to be so careful. Unless we consciously surrender our near ones to God’s Will every day, we are bound to be affected if they do something wrong in the inner world. Something in our consciousness will be damaged.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inside my Transcendental picture you want to imagine a crying child? No, that is not the way. My Transcendental as such is not crying. In a sense, you can say it is crying for the perfection of the human beings, but my Transcendental is full of infinite compassion, love and light. When I spoke about the crying child within, I meant that you as an individual have to cry the way a child cries. You can cry to my Transcendental for the things you need, to discriminate right from wrong, and so on. The Transcendental will fulfil your aspiration. But if the Transcendental also starts crying, how will the Transcendental be able to give anything? For those who cry to the Transcendental the way a child cries, the Transcendental embodies infinite compassion, blessings, love and light, and these divine attributes or qualities will enter into you. If you wish, you can ask the Transcendental to teach you how to cry. The Transcendental itself is not going to cry, but in a deeper sense the Transcendental <em>does</em> cry for the transformation and perfection of humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not an expert on music. For that you have to read books about Indian ragas. If you read Indian books, they will tell you which raga is best in the evening, which in the morning and which in the afternoon. But with regard to my music, since I have composed thousands of songs, you can make the choice. If you are not a singer, then you can listen to my tapes or to the disciples’ tapes, and see which songs are best for you. You be the judge. Some songs will appeal to you most early in the morning, others late in the evening and still others perhaps far into the night.</p>
<p>I have tried a few Indian ragas. Unfortunately, I do not agree that you have to listen to or play such and such a raga early in the morning and another one at noon. That approach does not appeal to me. I feel it depends on our consciousness. If our consciousness is not high, no matter which music we listen to, even the most soulful music, we will find nothing appealing in it. But if our consciousness is high, every kind of spiritual music will appeal to us. As I said before, you be the judge. Select a few songs, either sing them or listen to them at different times of the day, and then you decide which ones are best for you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Naturally it is simply impossible to make spiritual progress if she remains in the mind. But if she remains in the heart, then she will remain an eternal child. I am also in my fifties, but I feel I am still progressing. If you can remain in the heart, no matter how old you are, even at the age of 99, you can make progress. But if you remain in the mind, you will be bound to your physical age. There are disciples who are only 25 or 26 years old, but in terms of lethargy, unwillingness and other unaspiring attitudes which they cherish, they are acting like 90-year-olds. Again, there are two or three women who are on the wrong side of fifty, but how hard they work, how energetically, how eagerly! Sometimes they do not even go to sleep at night. How I appreciate them! They do not remain in the mind; they remain in the heart. They are always enthusiastic and ready to inspire others. So elderly women at your Centre should try to remain inside the heart. If this disciple remains inside the heart, she does not have to worry about her age. A childlike heart will help her to make all the necessary progress in her life.</p>
