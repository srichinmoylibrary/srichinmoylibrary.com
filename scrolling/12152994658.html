<p>The people are so nice here in the Bahamas. Everywhere I go, people wish me "Good morning, good morning!" When I am out walking, I want to enter into my meditation. But at least twenty times, different people tell me "Good morning!" If three ladies are passing by, each one has to say "Good morning!"</p>
<p>My answer is to smile. Again, how many times I have to smile! Sometimes I am walking so fast and I have to smile or say "Good morning." This happens on the path right in front of the hotel.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Little Girl With The Candy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Little Girl With The Candy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning, when I reached my two-mile mark on Queens Boulevard, I was debating with myself whether to go back the same way to make four miles, or whether to continue on to Hillside Avenue and then come up 150th Street to make a little more than six miles. Then I remembered how steep the hill on 150th Street is. I said, "I do not want to climb up that hill. It is impossible." So I started going back.</p>
<p>While going back, I passed right in front of the courthouse. There I saw a little girl about three or four years old. She was a very nice looking child and she was wearing white. She came up to me and said, "Sir, would you like to have a piece of candy?"</p>
<p>She was practically giving the candy to me. She was such a sweet little girl. Her older brother was four or five metres behind her. He came running and said, "No, you have to give me a dollar."</p>
<p>She was so nice. She wanted to give it to me for free, but he demanded a dollar from me. I felt very sad for the little girl because her brother was so bad, but I did not see what I could do at that moment. I crossed the road and walked about ten metres. The little girl also went away. Then I turned around. I said, "I must give her a dollar since she was such a sweet little girl."</p>
<p>When I turned around, she came running towards me. She said, "I want to give it to you for free." This time she had four or five pieces of candy in a small box. What happened? Immediately I put my hands in my pockets. I pulled out three one-dollar bills. Quickly I gave them to her. Then the brother came. When the brother came, I gave him a dollar.</p>
<p>Now the pieces of candy were in my hand. I said to her, "Would you make me happy?"</p>
<p>She said, "Why, yes."</p>
<p>I said, "Please, you take the candy. I am on a strict diet. I will not be able to eat it." I became a saint there! Yesterday I took 1,300 calories. I ate Sicilian pizza, a kind of cake, a candy bar, all kinds of things. Yesterday I ate everything, but today I became a saint.</p>
<p>The little girl was so kind. She looked at me. When I gave her the three dollars, she was very sad. She said, "I do not want money from you." But I gave them to her. Then when I returned the candies to her, she took them from me.</p>
<p>Her name was Eva. Her brother said, "Eva, you cannot give candy for free." He was only two or three years older than his sister. She got three dollars from me and he got one dollar from me. Then everything was over.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Lord Krishna&#039;s Blessing</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Lord Krishna&#039;s Blessing" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>While I was walking during the meditation at PS 86, during my third round I was seeing Lord Krishna playing on the flute. He went this side and that side. I was walking one way and he was walking the other way. How beautiful he looked, and how soulfully he was walking!</p>
<p>What was the reason? About an hour before, I invoked him to come and bless my dog Chela on Chela's birthday. He blessed the dog there at my house while I was feeding him. Chela's name was given to him by Lord Krishna. I gave him the name Dil, but Lord Krishna did not like it, so he changed the name.</p>
<p>Then tonight Lord Krishna came on his own while I was walking. I was in my highest, walking and meditating, and Lord Krishna was playing his flute, his soul-stirring flute. These are not my mental hallucinations. One day your third eye will also open up and you will see that everything is true. Lord Krishna was playing his flute and blessing us all.</p>
<p>Today was Lord Krishna's day. Many, many times when I walk, the spiritual Masters walk with me. Here in this school, they bless us all. That is why I am giving so much importance to the meditation when I walk. Please try to remain in your highest. That will be a great achievement for me and for you as well.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Water Fountain</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Water Fountain" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I went walking at TWA. A shoeshine man was so happy to see me. I do not know how the shoeshine men survive. As I was passing by their station, I asked them, "Where do you come from?" One man said China and another said Ukraine. The tall, thin one who is from the Ukraine is not nice at all.</p>
<p>I have been going to walk at TWA for four years or even more. Today, for the first time, I drank water from the water fountain there. Necessity knows no bounds. It was all my fault. I thought that Pulak would bring some water for me. But Pulak did not bring any water in his car.</p>
<p>I said, "All right, I shall buy some." I borrowed two dollars from Pulak, but when I went to the counter, I saw that it was not open. At six-thirty it is supposed to open, but I went at ten minutes to seven and it was not open. What could I do? I walked for two rounds, which is 500 metres, and then I decided to take a drink from the water fountain.</p>
<p>The first two or three times I pressed the button, the water was not going inside my mouth. It was all going into my nostrils and eyes. How do people drink this water? It went everywhere else, except inside my mouth. It even went into my ear! I said, "How is it going there?" I could not make the water go into the right place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pulak had purchased some water, but he did not come upstairs to give it to me. When I got into the car to go home, I said to him, "Pulak, now you have water. Why did you not bring it?"</p>
<p>He said, "I gave you the money."</p>
<p>He was sure that because he gave me the money, I would be able to buy water. Tomorrow I will not depend on him. And I do not think I will use the water fountain again. I never had that experience before.</p>

<p>While I am walking, I see many, many neighbours. Today I was entering into Divine Robe when a car stopped outside. A man asked, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I was talking to Govinda and from the car he called out.</p>
<p>What a smile I received from him!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Ascent And Descent Of Consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Ascent And Descent Of Consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How consciousness ascends and descends! This morning I forgot to take a towel for myself when I went out to walk. I desperately needed one, so one of the boys went out and bought me two small towels. Then I appreciated him and extolled him to the skies. He was very happy.</p>
<p>The next moment, his consciousness descended! I asked him to go and bring prasad. I looked at his face and I saw such hesitation on his face. Here I was appreciating and admiring him and the next moment he was showing such hesitation. I thought that perhaps he had no money, but I know that you all believe in credit cards. So I asked him what was wrong. He said that in his mind he wanted to go out for a run, and that is why he felt sad that he had to go to the store.</p>
<p>Previously, he developed such sympathetic oneness with me that he literally ran to get towels. Then when I appreciated him, his consciousness descended. His oneness only lasted for a few fleeting seconds.</p>
<p>Like this, everybody goes up and down, up and down.</p>

<p>Today Pulak took me to US Air to walk. Agraha accompanied us. Outside the terminal, the security men did not allow Pulak to park, so he had to circle round. Then he parked at one place and told the security, "Please let me wait here. It is a matter of two minutes."</p>
<p>The man was very, very nice to him and allowed him to wait at that place. Pulak waited for two minutes. Then the goddess of sleep descended on him. Meanwhile, I had finished my walk and Agraha and I were waiting outside the terminal for Pulak to come. Agraha was watching the time. So many minutes passed. We could not believe that he would take such a long time. Where could Pulak have gone?</p>
<p>Finally, after twenty-one minutes, Pulak appeared. As usual, Pulak said, "It cannot be twenty-one minutes! It is impossible. I just fell asleep for a minute or two."</p>
<p>We were wondering and wondering where he was. Even the security guard could not believe he was taking so long. How could he take such a long time? Pulak was 'meditating'.</p>

<p>This year I became a totally different person at our Masters Games. Previously, for various reasons, I did not go and shake hands with my old running friends or with the prominent athletes. This time I went up to so many and asked our photographers to take photos. As usual, my photographers were off duty.</p>
<p>During the day, I walked five laps on the track. While I was walking, a tall black man came up to me and said, "You are a celebrity. How can you mix with us?"</p>
<p>I said, "We are all brothers."</p>
<p>Then he looked at me with such joy and affection. I became very, very friendly to all the athletes.</p>
<p>I hope that at our Sports Day in August I can do a little running. Today what a struggle it was to do five laps walking!</p>
<p>It was a day of tremendous joy, success and achievement for all the athletes. They were so friendly and kind.</p>

<p>I have just started walking again. For years I was lame. From the middle of July I started seriously, so it is not even one month. My goal is to go 15 minutes a mile for 4 miles. Today I walked for 4 miles at Jones Beach. My time was 1 hour 10 minutes and 35 seconds.</p>
<p>I feel like my India days. My shoulder movement, chest, everything is Indian feeling. That is how I used to walk — very smartly.</p>

<p>This morning I was walking on 150th Street. An Indian gentleman crossed in front of me, but he did not say hello to me, and I did not say hello to him. We did not acknowledge each other. For about ten metres we continued walking. Then God knows what happened to him. At my 200-metre mark, he came back running to say, "Gurudev, good morning!"</p>
<p>I gave him a very broad smile.</p>
