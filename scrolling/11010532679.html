<p>Where was I? I was inside the Forgiveness-Heart of my Lord Supreme. Where am I? I am inside the Compassion-Eye of my Lord Supreme. Where shall I be? I shall be at the Protection-Feet of my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Who was I? I was God's birthless and death-less Vision-Light. Who am I? I am God's earth-ascending aspiration-cry. Who will I be? I will be God's Heaven-descending manifestation-delight.</p>
<p>When I occasionally think of God, He says to me: "My son, you have to cover the length and breadth of My entire creation walking all by yourself."</p>
<p>When I soulfully pray to God, He says to me: "My son, My son, I am waiting for you. I am expecting you in the blue of My Infinity's Sky."</p>
<p>When I silently meditate on God in the inmost recesses of my heart, He says to me: "My son, My son, My son, your fond invitation-hospitality I am accepting with immense Joy."</p>
<p>My soul unconditionally loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My heart faithfully loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My mind cautiously loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My vital dramatically loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. My body fearfully loves my Lord Beloved Supreme. And I love my Lord Beloved Supreme secretly, breathlessly, openly and sleeplessly. Secretly and breathlessly I love my Lord Beloved Supreme in His eternal Duty. Openly and sleeplessly I love my Lord Beloved Supreme in His universal Beauty.</p>

<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not think of You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not pray to You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not meditate on You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not serve You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do not love You. Yet You forgive me.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme, I do everything wrong and I say everything wrong. Yet You forgive me at every moment. Why, why, my Lord Beloved Supreme?</p>
<p>"My child, I am the eternal Dreamer and you are My Eternity's Dream. In My Existence-Consciousness-Reality I am dreaming in and through you at every moment. You want satisfaction. By not thinking of Me, by not praying to Me, by not meditating on Me, by not serving Me, by not loving Me, you will never have satisfaction. You can have satisfaction only by loving Me and claiming Me as your own, very own.</p>
<p>"In My case, too, I cannot get satisfaction, full satisfaction, unless I can make you a perfect seeker and a perfect human being. Throughout Eternity I have been longing for humanity's perfection. This perfection needs My infinite Compassion and My birthless and deathless Forgiveness. If necessary, I shall wait throughout Eternity to make each creation of Mine perfectly perfect, for this is My Eternity's Dream.</p>
<p>"I forgive you because I know there shall come a time when you will become a choice instrument of Mine. Not only that, you will become My representative here on earth. In you and through you I shall bless the world with a special Message: the Message of universal oneness.</p>
<p>"My child, do not be sad that you do not think of Me, that you do not pray to Me, that you do not meditate on Me, that you do not serve Me and that you do not even love Me. Do not be doomed to disappointment. There shall come a time when you will be awakened, fully awakened. My unconditional Compassion will awaken your entire being, your earthly life. Then you will think of Me sleeplessly, pray to Me breathlessly, meditate on Me soulfully, serve Me self-givingly and love Me unconditionally. That golden Hour is fast approaching. I am all Love and you, My child, must be fully prepared to receive Me with all your heart's love and love, gratitude and gratitude."</p>

<p>I must sleeplessly raise my aspiration-heart. I must immediately lower my resistance-mind.</p>
<p>I must never allow my aspiration-heart and dedication-life to fall asleep at my Beloved Supreme's God-manifestation-wheel.</p>
<p>I must never allow inferiority's quick and wild invasion of my heart. At the same time, I must never allow superiority's vainglory-aggrandisement to enter into my mind.</p>
<p>My sense of helplessness, unworthiness and uselessness definitely is my own creation. Nobody has thrust these weaknesses upon me. I must not allow them to force me to walk towards my spirituality-graveyard.</p>
<p>Here and now I must draw the curtain over my uncertainty-mind. I must bring to the fore my confidence-heart, which is always eager to listen to the dictates of my Inner Pilot. I must completely evacuate my mind's complaint-department, for it is only with oneness-love that I can have peace in my mind.</p>
<p>I must never neglect my heart's enthusiasm-fragrance-garden. I must never carry with me my yesterday's elephant-heavy frustration-burden. In spite of my teeming weaknesses, my Lord Supreme tells me that He will before long grant me His Eternity's Peace and Infinity's Grace. "Why, why, why?" I ask my Lord Beloved Supreme. He tells me that His choice Hour has struck for me. Now I am consciously willing to listen to His Dictates. I am consciously willing to change; I am consciously willing to be moulded, guided and liberated from the meshes of ignorance-night by Him.</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme to please in His own Way is the sole reason I came into the world. I must and I must please and fulfil Him at every moment. His Satisfaction can be my only satisfaction. There is no other way. This solemn promise of my entire being I am now offering to my Inner Pilot Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p>This morning I offered my body's awakening to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my vital's determination to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my mind's willingness to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my heart's surrender to my Lord Beloved Supreme. I offered my life's readiness to my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my body, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your wakefulness. Never, never go back to ignorance-sleep — never! For you is My infinite Compassion."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my vital, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your determination. I am now transforming your determination into adamantine will power."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my mind, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your willingness. I shall definitely make you a choice instrument of Mine."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my heart, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your surrender. I shall inundate you with My boundless Delight."</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my life, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your readiness. Now that you are ready, I want you to serve Me in My entire creation."</p>
<p>This evening I offered my soul's fulfilled fragrance-promise to my Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>My Lord Beloved Supreme said to my soul, "My child, I am so proud of you. I am so proud of your patience-light. For aeons you have been dreaming in and through the physical consciousness, the vital consciousness, the mental consciousness, the psychic consciousness and the life-river to manifest Me here on earth. I am exceedingly proud of you, My child."</p>
<p>Then my Lord Beloved Supreme said to my body, vital, mind, heart, life and soul, "My sweet children, I began piloting My Eternity's Dream Boat with you, and now with you I have reached My Infinity's Reality Shore. To you all I am offering My Immortality's Blessings."</p>
<p>My body, my vital, my mind, my heart, my life and my soul all said to our Lord Beloved Supreme, "O Supreme, You are our Eternity's All, All, All."</p>

Do not offer even an iota of affection to your insecurity. Be a constant prayer-cry and a constant meditation-illumination."</p>
<p>My Lord Supreme, I do not know how to pray. I do not know how to meditate. Is there any way You can teach me how to pray and how to meditate? Is there any way You can shorten the distance to my destination? Is there any way you can expedite my spiritual journey?</p>
<p>My child, I am telling you the supreme secret: cry like a child, sleeplessly cry; and smile like a child, sleeplessly smile. If you can cry sleeplessly for My Compassion-Eye, then you will learn how to pray. If you can smile sleeplessly inside My Satisfaction-Heart, I shall teach you how to meditate.

  <h2 id="page-title">Stupidity, insecurity and fear</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Stupidity, insecurity and fear" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Stupidity, insecurity and fear are three foes of our inner life. Stupidity includes insecurity and fear. As a matter of fact, stupidity encompasses everything that is unaspiring and negative in our life of aspiration. Why am I stupid and why do I remain stupid? I am stupid because I have not yet seen my true form and I have not yet realised my own highest height. I remain stupid precisely because inwardly I cherish stupidity.</p>
<p>There is not a single day when my mind does not cherish authority and supremacy. In my outer life I try to exercise supremacy over others; I show my undue and unauthorised authority. As soon as I show my authority and supremacy, I separate myself from the rest of mankind. With the disappearance of my oneness-life, my stupidity begins.</p>
<p>Why am I insecure and why do I remain insecure? I am insecure because I have not yet felt my inseparable oneness with the rest of the world. I remain insecure because inwardly I cherish insecurity in a very strange and peculiar way: I think that my insecurity is keeping me alert and cautious. I know that I have countless superiors but very few inferiors. But because of my insecurity I am always afraid that even these inferiors are going to dethrone me and start dominating me.</p>
<p>As long as I do not have confidence in the purest sense, I feel that I have to keep insecurity at my heart's door to protect me, which is absurdity on the face of it.</p>
<p>Why am I afraid? I am afraid of certain people for various reasons, but the main reason is that I dislike them. When I dislike anyone, I feel that the person I dislike is always speaking ill of me; I feel that sleeplessly and breathlessly that person is counting my shortcomings. I feel that he is leaving no stone unturned to expose me to the outer world. Because I dislike others, because I have no love for others and feel no oneness with them, I am afraid of the world. Where there is division and lack of oneness, there is always fear. But if I like the world, the world will also like me. If I love the world, my love will be reciprocated. In the life of a person who does not feel oneness with the rest of the world, stupidity, fear and insecurity can never come to an end.</p>
<p>Stupidity, insecurity, fear: These are my problems. But do I sincerely, soulfully and bravely try to liberate myself from these problems? No! I feel in a very peculiar way that my countless problems are keeping me alive. I feel that if I had no problems, by this time I would have become lifeless, inactive, and my life of sloth and inertia would have made me even more miserable. I feel that because I have problems to face, my inner energy comes to the fore. Alas, these are the strange ideas that I cherish.</p>
<p>At times, when I am beset with problems, I go to my friends and dear ones in the hope that they will be able to free me from my problems. But, like me, they too are loaded with problems, and they cannot help me.</p>
<p>Each problem is an inner ailment, an inner disease, and only an inner doctor can cure me. My inner doctor is my Inner Pilot. He tells me, "My son, I can cure you of all your problems, but I have to charge you a fee. The fee that I need is your constant prayer-life. The fee that I want is your constant aspiration-life. If you give Me your prayerful heart and your aspiration-life, I shall cure you of all your centuries-old maladies. Only a life of prayer and a heart of meditation can cure you of your long-cherished ignorance-dream.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Helplessness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Helplessness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>What is the thing that I like most about myself today? My utter helplessness. I never knew that genuine helplessness could be so pure, so soulful, so useful and so fruitful. Up until now, I thought that the entire world was at my behest. I thought that everything I could have for the asking, that everything was within my easy reach. Like Napoleon, I thought that impossibility was not born in my life. Like Julius Caesar, I thought I could utter: "I came, I saw, I conquered." But alas, now I see that my feeling about myself was utterly wrong.</p>
<p>When I studied world history, I identified myself with all the supreme heroes of the world, and my complete imagination-identification made me feel that I was one of them. I felt that I belonged to the galaxy of contemporary great souls. This is how my imagination, which is nothing other than mental hallucination, ran riot. But now, alas, I see that helplessness is my name, inner and outer.</p>
<p>What do I learn from my helplessness? I learn a most significant lesson: surrender to a higher Power-the Power that acts in and through me and in and through all, the Power that does and the Power that eternally is. I wanted to get satisfaction by lording it over the world, by becoming something. But now I see that abiding satisfaction can be achieved only by constant, conscious and cheerful surrender to God's Will.</p>
<p>I also realise that I must sincerely and genuinely accept the world and not expect anything from the world, for expectation is nothing other than frustration and frustration is synonymous with destruction. No expectation, no frustration and no destruction. Willingness, constant willingness to serve God the Creator and God the creation unconditionally must be my new name. If I can serve God the creation and love God the Creator soulfully, sleeplessly and unconditionally, only then can I have satisfaction and peace infinite. Pride must be banished from my mind-territory and humility must surcharge my heart. Inside this humility I must sleeplessly feel my utter helplessness, which is nothing other than my conscious awareness of my Inner Pilot Supreme. Him to serve in His own Way I came into this world: this is what I must remember at every moment, for this is the key to my life's perfection and my heart's constant satisfaction.</p>
