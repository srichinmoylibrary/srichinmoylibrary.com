<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you dream of me, that means you are actually receiving one part of my being. When you see me in a dream, part of your physical being, part of your vital being or part of your mental being is receiving me. Or instead of a part, it can be the whole being; the whole physical being, vital being, or mental being can receive me. But if it is a part of your physical being, or the physical being proper, if it still has impurity in it, it will be frightened to receive and welcome the Master. If it is the vital being or a part of the vital being, it may be frightened because of its aggressive and stubborn qualities. If it is a part of the mental being or the mental being proper, it may be frightened because of its obscurity and lack of wideness.But there comes a time when the disciple has made considerable progress in the spiritual life. The moment he receives his Master with part of his physical being or the physical being proper, he feels a sense of tremendous joy — the joy that awakens him and makes him aware of the world within him and without him. Then if part of the vital or the entire vital being receives the Master, he feels that he is marching and running toward his destined Goal. And if part of the mind or the entire mental being receives the Master, then he feels that he is flying, flying in the sky of Infinity and Eternity. So, almost any part of our being can actually receive the Master in a dream.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every human being is of the opinion that a dream is infinitely more inspiring than reality. The immediate effect of a dream on our mind is to create inspiration, This is because when we are in the dream world all our soul’s capacities are at our disposal. We can do many things and see many things which we cannot do or see during our waking hours. We can freely enter into many realms which we cannot enter at other times. When you develop the inner capacity to enter into all these realms at will, then you will see that dream and reality have become one. At that time reality and dream will be equally inspiring.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mother India was shedding tears of gratitude because you are all Americans and you have accepted me so devotedly and soulfully. When Mother India sees that children from another shore have accepted her son as their own, very own, she is very happy. Mother India was shedding tears of gratitude because I love you people and you people also love me. In my acceptance of America and in America’s acceptance of me, we have become one.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! Aspiration always increases one’s capacity to remember dreams. But here we have to know what the connection is between aspiration and purification. The connection between the two is very simple. Aspiration tells us that God is within. Purification tells us that God is all around. Just as we increase our purification through aspiration, through purification we also increase our aspiration. When we give ourselves totally to God, our aspiration increases. When we receive from God devotedly, our purification increases.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do dreams have anything to do with ambition?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do dreams have anything to do with ambition?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dreams can easily have much to do with ambition. There are usually two types of ambition. One is like the ambition of Napoleon and Caesar and Alexander the Great. When Caesar said, <em>Veni, vidi, vici,</em> “I came, I saw, I conquered,” that is vital ambition. But spiritual ambition will say, “I saw, I loved, I became.” With vital ambition we try to trample others and dominate others, but with spiritual ambition we try to become inseparably and universally one with others. This kind of ambition is good.</p>
<p>In the outer world you are a pilot. When you fly, at that time if you feel that your consciousness is flying in the sky of Infinity and Eternity, then you are flying into something infinite. But if your ambition is only to go from one place on earth to another, then your goal is limited. It is not an ever-transcending Goal. So if you dream of doing something expanding, something transcending, that kind of dream embodies spiritual ambition. But if the dream has its start and finish together, if you know your own destination, then you cannot go very far. The ambition that binds you and the ambition that frees you, liberates you, or gives you a sense of Infinity are two different ambitions. When you have a dream, try to feel that you are entering into the worlds of beauty, peace, light and bliss where everything is constantly growing in infinite measure and where everything is transcending its own reality. If you have that kind of dream, if you have that kind of ambition, then earth-life is meaningful and fruitful, and you really become a chosen instrument of the Supreme, for the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On very rare occasions, if the dream occurs on a very high plane, and if the disciple is very spiritual and devoted and sincere, then the message can be really true. But many times the dream will come from the vital plane. The disciple carrying the message will have his own likes and dislikes and vital propensities. This kind of dream you cannot believe.</p>
<p>Every day I hear hundreds of juicy stories about what “Guru has said.” This is on the physical plane. But those who are saying this do not go to the length of saying that I have asked them to give you a message. No! They only say, “Guru has said this, Guru has said that.” Where, when, to whom they do not mention. The context in which I said it they totally forget. In order to gain prominence, in order to make others feel they are close to the Master, they say this. I cannot be responsible for their message at that time. So you have to be on your guard. Each disciple has his own personality; this personality may enter into the message that you are going to get and it can be totally wrong.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we feel that some divine dreams will inspire us because for the past few days or weeks or months we have not been able to meditate well, then it is advisable to try to have divine dreams when we go to sleep. In this case, they will be an inspiration to help us meditate as well as we once used to. But if we are only carried away by the word ‘dream’ and want to have a dream for the sake of the pleasant feeling or pleasure it gives, then it does not help our spiritual life in any way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important are dreams?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important are dreams?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It entirely depends on the seeker’s necessity. If the seeker needs a dream in order to inspire him to go deep within or to go far beyond the mind, then dreams are of paramount importance. Divine dreams, spiritual dreams, do play a considerable role in one’s spiritual life. Also, we have to know that everything is a dream before it is manifested in the world of reality. If we value a reality, then we have to value the dream as well. But this does not mean that we have to have thousands and millions of dreams in order to have God-realisation. No! If we have a few significant dreams, that is more than enough. Even if we do not have any dreams, that will not stand in our way.</p>
<p>But there is not a single human being on earth who has not had any dreams.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em>: When we dream, our souls visit many different planes of consciousness. Our soul is like a bird. Today it sits on one branch, tomorrow it can sit on another branch and the day after tomorrow on a third branch. Every time we have a dream, there is the possibility for our soul to enter into different planes of consciousness. If the soul wants to, it can enter one particular plane many times. But, like us, the soul enjoys variety. It likes to visit different states of consciousness. Novelty gives us joy; so also in the case of the soul. By visiting new planes of consciousness it acquires more light and, at the same time, offers light from its own self. There is mutual giving and taking.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you dream of me, it is absolutely true that one part of my being or one emanation of mine is in touch with you. My physical mind may not know and need not know what is happening, but an inner existence of mine is definitely aware of it. And if something very important, serious, significant, dangerous, alarming or illumining has happened, then the emanation or inner being of mine is bound to bring the message into my physical mind either that morning or during the day. But if it is only the kind of divine nourishment that you usually get, then the being need not or will not bring it to my attention. When you dream of me, it is either because I knew of the situation previously and wanted you to have the dream so that you would know or do something special, or it is because of my soul’s love for you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a dream of exhilarating flying, you have to know that that dream has actually taken place in the vital world — not the lower vital but the higher vital plane, where our vital actually flies. We do not fly on the mental plane or any other plane, but only on the vital. When we become part and parcel of that vital plane, we do fly. And when you become a Yogi, then if you fly in the vital plane, you become aware that it is your vital being that is flying and you can convince your physical mind of this. Otherwise, you may think your flying is a coincidence or a mere stroke of fate or luck. But when you realise God, you feel that your own capacity, your own light, is enabling you to fly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since you have accepted the spiritual life, if you see in your dreams that you are dead or you are dying, then you have to know that it is the death of the vital, of the physical, or of something that was rebellious, destructive, undivine or hostile. Anything that stood as an obstacle to your God-realisation, anything that stood as a hindrance to your manifestation of light or to your aspiration, is dying so that a new life of aspiration and dedication can dawn. If you see that you are dead in a dream, usually it means something wrong in you is now dead, and a new life is dawning very fast.</p>
<p>But sometimes it means that you are not feeding some of your good qualities. If someone led a spiritual life for many years and became an advanced aspirant, and then if he gave up the spiritual life altogether, this kind of dream will mean that the divine in that person — his sincerity, simplicity, humility, purity and other good qualities — is dying. But when you are practising the spiritual life, this question does not arise. At that time it is your physical life, lower vital life, undivine life that is dying so that a new life of illumination and aspiration can dawn.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. When one dreams, if at that time the consciousness is low and unaspiring, then it affects the seeker in us. This kind of dream is detrimental to our inner life. If we have this kind of dream, the best thing is to meditate more sincerely, more devotedly, more soulfully on the following day. In this way we can prevent these undivine dreams from entering into us, and stop their attack. Low types of dreams especially do affect our inner sky. They cloud our mental sky and ruin our aspiration or dynamic vital, and even try to destroy our physical health.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can a spiritual dream be as beneficial as meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can a spiritual dream be as beneficial as meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a kind of dream which amounts to vision. If you have a dream that indicates an imminent new dawn, a new birth, this kind of dream is nothing short of a vision and it is as good as a high meditation. If you have that kind of vision, you can get God-realisation if it is God’s Will. Sri Ramakrishna used to say that if you have a vision of the highest order, if the Supreme wants to, He can give you partial realisation. Such a dream is not only as good as meditation, but far surpasses meditation. It is a vision of the highest order, a minor realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do our feelings or emotional reactions in dreams reflect our soul’s feelings?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do our feelings or emotional reactions in dreams reflect our soul’s feelings?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul proper is not affected by our emotional actions and reactions. When we use the term ‘emotion’, usually we are referring to vital emotion, and this cannot affect the soul. But if the soul enters into the plane of the lower vital and accepts the emotional life of the vital world as its very own and becomes part and parcel of it, then it is affected. If the soul enters into the vital plane and makes the vital plane feel it is ready to deal with its emotional problems, then the soul puts aside its own divinity and can suffer from the emotional problems of the vital life. But if the soul wants to remain aloof and separate, it can. There is no danger to the soul’s light; it is eternally pure. If the soul remains in its own plane, then it will not be affected.</p>
<p>Everything depends on the soul’s compassion, on its inclination to help the vital life of the person. If I want to take your karma, I take it and then I suffer like anything for days and months. But it is up to me to accept it or not. If I take your impurities, I can rid myself of them because I have the capacity. I can take some garbage and just throw it into the universal Consciousness right away, or I can bring it to a certain spot and leave it there and then, at the right time, throw it into the proper place. But the soul cannot take something from you and then throw it into the universal Consciousness. Only spiritual Masters can do that.</p>
