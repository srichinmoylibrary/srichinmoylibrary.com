<p>Today, when I was playing tennis after lifting the car, those six boys on my calf machine and so on, I didn’t have the strength in my legs to take even one further step. Both my legs were like two wooden things, absolutely numb, with no sensation at all. I played mechanically, using only my will power. Even then the boys didn’t win. I won 9 games and they won one. God alone knows when my bragging will end.</p>

<p>Soon I will lift an elephant, the way I have lifted cars. Now, if my disciples make it so difficult, if they use an elephant that weighs too much, then I will ask them to try to lift it instead of me. If I fail, then I will say, “All right, now you try.”</p>
<p>Once in India there was a very great Bengali boxer. They tied a rope around him, like the ones used in tug-of-war, full of grease. He had escaped from the rope so many times. But this time, when he tried, he couldn’t do it. One thousand people were watching. Some people showed sympathy; some were laughing.</p>
<p>Then he started screaming at his student, saying that he had to do it, since he was to one who had asked him to come and perform. So the student could not do it.</p>

<p>About a month ago, I tried so hard to move the 400-pound weight, even on the same level. I could not move it at all.</p>
<p>I was telling the Supreme, “You always cut jokes with me. Now I am cutting jokes with You.”</p>
<p>Now I have made such fast progress from 300 to 400. It is all due to confidence and also the fact that my muscle power has increased — which means my receptivity to God’s Compassion and God’s Grace has increased.</p>
<p>Exactly one month ago, on Agraha’s birthday, I lifted double my body weight, 320. Today I have done 80 pounds more — 400. But I don’t think I have gained 80 pounds!</p>

<p>Today’s weightlifting prayer that I gave before I tried to lift 400 pounds is different from some of my other weightlifting prayers. That is because, in the intuitive world, I knew that I would succeed in my lift today. That much intuition I have. I knew at least a half hour in advance. So today my prayer was:</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, my Beloved Supreme,<br /> I know, I know, each miracle performed<br /> Here on earth by human beings<br /> Is the descent of Your special Compassion-Blessing<br /> From Your high Vision-Light-Heaven to earth<br /> So that she can inspire her children<br /> To believe in Your higher worlds and inner worlds<br /> And thus become Your choice instruments<br /> To manifest Your Divinity here on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A family gathering</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A family gathering" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I started weightlifting around 7:27. On my first attempt, which I always use as a warm-up, I got the weight up a little. So I was filled with confidence that I would achieve my goal. However, on my second attempt, the weight didn’t move at all and I became furious. I said to myself, “Today I have decided to lift up 400 pounds. Now who will dare to stand in my way at this time?”</p>
<p>On the third lift, I saw my whole family seated by the wall to my right. Some had already departed this world and some are alive, but I saw them so vividly! They were more real than actual human beings. My mother and my sister Lily were seated side by side. Above them were Ahana and Arpita. Then Hriday, Chitta and Mantu were above them. Finally, on the very top, was my father. All of them were in a very soulful and very intense consciousness.</p>
<p>As soon as I finished my third lift, they all smiled soulfully. But the brightest smile came from my eldest brother, Hriday. His whole face beamed with joy. He said, “Madal, you are our Lord Sri Aurobindo’s genuine pride.”</p>
<p>Then my sister Lily asked me to try again. “I am more than satisfied,” I told her. “No, try again!” she begged. So, at my sister’s request, I did try again.</p>
<p>My whole family remained seated in the same position, and once again they were watching me seriously, soulfully and intensely. The most poise I saw in my mother. Being a mother, she could have been full of panic, worry and anxiety, but she was only intense and serious.</p>
<p>Then I lifted the 400 pounds again, and this lift was even better. I was so happy and my family were all so excited. Their happiness far, far surpassed my own. My happiness was nothing in comparison to theirs.</p>
<p>My father came to me and put his palms on my head to bless me. “I wanted this for you,” he said.</p>
<p>Then my mother came to bless me. I had to bend down because she is so short, whereas my father is tall. On the video you can see how I was bending so that she could bless me. How affectionately she was blessing me, with tears of joy in her eyes. She was pouring her love and affection into me.</p>
<p>Then my eldest brother Hriday came and pressed my shoulders with his hands.</p>
<p>Next, my brother Chitta approached me very happily and proudly. He said, “Bravo! Bravo!”</p>
<p>Then my eldest sister, Arpita, came and said, “Useless, useless, useless!”</p>
<p>“What is useless?” I asked her.</p>
<p>She replied, “I cannot pray to God for your weightlifting. I can only pray to God for you to have a few good disciples. Your weightlifting will give me joy only if you can have a few good disciples.”</p>
<p>Then came my sister Ahana, whom we used to call Mary. She came and told me, “Earth does not know who you are and perhaps will never know who you are. But we in Heaven know who you eternally are.”</p>
<p>My sister Lily was next. First she looked into my left eye, then into my right eye, then into my left eye and finally again into my right eye. Then she placed her hand on her own heart and offered her gratitude to God.</p>
<p>Then the last one to come was my brother Mantu. “Enough,” he said. “Enough in this life.”</p>
<p>After the conversation, when the heavenly scene was over, I offered my gratitude to my Lord Supreme and to my Mother Kali. Then I hurried to the phone to give Ranjana the happiest news. Ranjana came to my house and from there she called Unmilan to come also. I invited a few others, and we all watched the video together.</p>
<p>So this is the way to have life-confidence. You have to say, “Tomorrow, I will be an unconditionally surrendered disciple.” As I said, “I am doing it; I have done it,” so you have to say, “I shall do it; I have done it.” Now that I have played my role, you have to play your role with utmost determined inner confidence and inner certitude.</p>

<p>The other day I was reading a funny book. It said that to prove how strong your fingers are, you should put a match stick between your fingers and break it. So I did it.</p>
<p>Then I said, “Let me try two.” After I broke two, I said, “Now let me try three.”</p>
<p>I also broke three. Then I said, “Oh, I am really strong!”</p>

<p>Before I lifted the elephant in Connecticut this morning, I garlanded it. I was telling the elephant, “We have to become very good friends.”</p>
<p>We were very good friends when I was lifting it up and also when I was offering it my gratitude. But, at the last minute, the elephant frightened me and I had to run away.</p>
<p>The elephant’s name was Karen, the same as Mahiyan’s sister.</p>

<p>About six months ago I went to a leg specialist. The lady examined my legs and said they were so weak that she wondered how I could walk. Then she gave me exercises to strengthen my legs. She told me to put five-pound weights around my ankles and lift. And she charged me $100 for that message.</p>
<p>She did it all by computer. The computer gave the message that my legs were so bad. We should send her a picture of my calf raise.</p>

<p>Bill Pearl’s soul started coming to me in Japan. God knows how many times his soul has come since then.

<p>Today I lifted up 450 pounds. It was my second day of practice and my seventh attempt altogether. Before I lifted, I gave this prayer:</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme, do give me the strength<br /> That can love the world in Your own Way.<br /> Do give me the strength<br /> That can serve the world in Your own Way.<br /> Do give me the strength<br /> That will fulfil the world in Your own Way,<br /> My Lord, my Lord.</p>

<p>Then, while I was lifting the weight, Lord Krishna was blessing me with His divine Presence. I saw Him in His golden form. He was holding the sudarshan chakra in His Hand and this disc was rotating very fast.</p>
<p>Now I have put 503 pounds on the rack, so let us see how long it takes.</p>

<p>How tired one can become coming back from Manhattan! While coming home from the city this afternoon, the car didn’t move; there was such traffic! I became so tired. But then when I got home, I lifted 503 pounds with my one-arm lift.</p>
<p>Usually when I lift, after my first and second attempts I do not sit down. Then, after my third attempt I sit down on my exercise chair for a few seconds and concentrate to get added blessing-strength. This time, when I was sitting down after my third, fourth, fifth and sixth attempts, Mother Kali came. She was blessing me and caressing my head.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when I called India, my sister said that in a dream she had seen Mother Kali blessing me. My sister said she had been worrying like anything since my 300-pound lift. On the one hand she is full of tremendous joy and pride because of my weightlifting achievements. On the other hand, she is dying of worries.</p>
<p>Before I started lifting this evening, my weightlifting prayer was very significant:</p>

<p>My Lord Supreme,<br /> May Your absolute Victory supreme<br /> Be proclaimed at every moment<br /> In and through my aspiration-heart<br /> And my dedication-life.</p>
