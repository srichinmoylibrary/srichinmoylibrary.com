<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this incarnation it took me twenty years to climb the spiritual ladder, even after I had climbed to the top in previous incarnations. I know about my past incarnations. Even in my previous incarnations I attained God-realisation. It is up to others to believe this or not. After attaining the height of <em>nirvikalpa samadhi</em> in this incarnation, I had to practise meditation most vigorously for twenty years, from the age of twelve to thirty-two. This subject is most difficult, and one has to practise daily for eight, ten, twelve hours or more if one really wants to reach the Highest. This eight hours also has to be done most sincerely and most devotedly. It is a very arduous task.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For spiritual Masters, their inner life is like an ocean; their outer life is only a tiny drop. But that tiny drop the disciples and the seekers have to be satisfied with, for that drop is more than enough for them to receive. It is sometimes too much for them, beyond their capacity.</p>
<p>You may see that every evening I am here, there, everywhere, but I know how many things are happening inside me. I may be enjoying someone's performance; it may be giving me real joy. But at the same time I am dealing with many other things. I am smiling, laughing, enjoying, but inside me arrows of suffering are coming from the disciples, from Centres and also from people whom I do not know at all. I do not know their names or anything, but they have seen that there is a place where the heart is a little big, so they send their suffering. If you ask me who they are, I will not be able to tell you, but they are coming to me inwardly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Aum</em> is the name of God, God in His three major aspects. "A" represents God the Creator, "U" represents God the Preserver, and "M" represents God the Transformer. When I chant <em>Aum,</em> I enter into my highest consciousness. When I am in real meditation, at that time if I chant <em>Aum</em> once, I enter into my highest transcendental Consciousness, where Infinity, Eternity and Immortality play together. But if I am giving a talk, and during the talk I say the word <em>Aum,</em> that does not mean that I am entering into my highest consciousness or contacting the Infinite. At that time my purpose is different: it is just to throw light on the aspiring souls. If they want to go deeper inside my consciousness or into their own highest consciousness, then they have to meditate. Then if we chant <em>Aum</em> together at the end of meditation, we can enter into the highest worlds.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> These beings are fought with occult power. They do not have physical force, but they can manifest physically. For instance, they can damage the legs of chairs. We fought with occult and vital power, subtle vital power, not on the physical plane. We fought entirely with energy. Yet, people heard the sound for several blocks. No human being could produce that sound — only vital beings. They are beings without physical form, but subtly they can take any form they want. They do not have human appearance, but they do have a subtle appearance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will you ever write your autobiography?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will you ever write your autobiography?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a person becomes great, then millions of stories are fabricated about him. I have concentrated on many so-called great men as well as on some who are really great men. Since they are great, there are thousands of stories connected with them, yet most of these stories actually have nothing to do with that person. There are millions of things attributed to them that did not happen in their lives. People just create from rumour and then, afterwards, when it is found in their biographies, it becomes fact. But there is no authenticity. It is just that somebody wanted to say something about a certain great person. Many times people are inspired and get emotionally carried away, so what they say may also be of no value. So it is always better if one has been lucky enough to write down what he wants to say about himself.</p>
<p>Right now I do not want to take the time to write down stories about my past, my childhood; they will not help you at all in your God-realisation. I always discourage my disciples from looking at my past, because I am what I am now. True, sometimes when I am inspired, I tell you of my childhood and adolescence, but I know these juicy stories will not help you even an iota in your God-realisation. Twenty years ago, everything was inside me — spiritual Master, Yogi, everything — but I was not a Yogi for the world. In the Bible when Mary asked Jesus to turn water into wine at the wedding, he said it was not yet time for him to do this kind of thing. In my case, when I was a youth, it was not the right time for me to have disciples. Right now is the time. When the hour strikes, at that time the seekers must derive all benefit.</p>
<p>What I have been doing since I came to America is of real importance. Other things are not important. In the life of the Christ only three years are important. What he did before he was thirty years old, God alone knows. What do we see or get from his life before thirty? Nothing! But during the years from thirty to thirty-three he did things which are immortal. The earth-consciousness is still treasuring the things which he did: it is still treasuring his love and compassion.</p>
<p>If you people feel: "Oh, if I could only know something about the Christ before he was thirty, then I would be saved," I will say, "No, the less you know of the personal aspect, the unimportant aspect, the better. Just pay all attention to the goal itself." On the mango tree there are many branches and thousands and thousands of leaves. But what you need is the mango. If you know where the mango is, you have everything. Why do you want to know how many leaves there are on the tree? If you are hungry and thirsty, the mango alone will fulfil you, not the leaves. So you should eat your mango and be satisfied.</p>
<p>When one becomes a real Master and he is in a position to offer Light, the Light is the mango. If you want to get the mango too soon, before it is ripe, you will see only the leaves. So now I am the mango, the Light. This is the time to look at the mango — my present — and not at the leaves, which represent my past.</p>

<p>Dear children, the Golden Boat is not mine. This Boat belongs to the Supreme. We are all passengers on this Boat. You may say that I am an experienced passenger because I have been on this Boat for a longer time than you have been. But I wish to say that this Boat belongs to the Supreme. Right now He has only a few hundred passengers on this Boat, but a day will dawn when he will have seven thousand passengers or even more. And in the near or distant future the Boat of the Supreme, where we are all now seated, will carry not only seven hundred or seven thousand individuals, but the whole of humanity to the Golden Shores of the Beyond. The Transcendental Supreme in His Golden Boat will carry all of us to the Golden Shores of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>If the human in me has been blessed by the Supreme with the capacity to write 208 poems in one day, then I pray to the Supreme in me to grant me the capacity to offer you, my sweet children, my heart's deepest blessingful gratitude twenty million times. You are my inspiration, and in you is my Goal. By manifesting the Supreme in each of you I fulfil my God-appointed task. With you I have started my journey, and with you I will eternally continue in the Boat of the Supreme Pilot. Our journey will never come to an end. There will be no journey's close for our Supreme Pilot, the eternal Guru, the only Guru here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>
<p>The human in me will write many more poems. It may happen that the human in me will exceed the number that we already have offered to the world at large in one day. But I wish to tell you again, as I have always been telling you, that it is not a matter of quantity versus quality. The Supreme in me commands me to write poems, and I assure you that He also gives me the capacity to achieve quality. The Supreme in me and the poet in me go together. The Supreme is at once my inner vision and my outer judgement together.</p>
<p>Many men may write hundreds or thousands of poems. I too shall write thousands if so is the Will of the Supreme. But the divine in me invokes the Supreme to grant me only one boon, and that is gratitude to you, my children, for what you have done for me and for what you will do for me throughout Eternity. This feeling of gratitude I wish to place around the neck of each seeker of the transcendental Truth, for each seeker deserves it.</p>
<p>Again, I wish to say that this is not my boat: it is the Boat of the Supreme. I am an experienced or advanced member in the Boat. As I always tell you, I am one of you; I am a brother of yours. Our Father is somebody else. I was born into this spiritual family a few years before you were born, so naturally I am expected to have made a little more progress than you have. Now I am in a position to tell you about the Supreme, who is our eternal Father, eternal Mother, eternal Friend, eternal Beloved. I try to teach you how to grow into His very Image. I show you where our Father is, and then my role is over.</p>
<p>The Supreme is always in the process of transcending His own evolving Consciousness. At every second He is transcending the limits of His own Transcendence. That is why we say that He is in the process of ever-transcending Reality, Divinity and Immortality. Today I pray to the Supreme Pilot to grant me the opportunity and the capacity to offer my blessingful gratitude countless times to each of you, for each disciple, each seeker, has given me the opportunity to be of service to the Supreme in him. It is not you who should be proud of your so-called leader on earth; it is I who should at every moment be proud of you and offer you my most soulful gratitude. It is you who have given me the opportunity and it is you who have chosen me to be of dedicated and devoted service to you all.</p>
