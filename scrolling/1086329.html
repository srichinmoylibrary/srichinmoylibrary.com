<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of yourself as a runner in a race. When the starter says, "Get on your mark; get set," at that time you feel all your body weight, your whole existence, on your fingertips. The fingertips take the weight but the actual power is coming from your heart, from your soul. The determination is coming from your inner existence, and this determination itself is power. Similarly, in the spiritual life, when you are concentrating and meditating, you are running toward your goal; inwardly you are a spiritual runner.</p>
<p>Our physical body is composed of various parts: our head, arms, legs and so on. Although the body is one unit, you will see that the hands do not always cooperate with the legs or the eyes do not always co-operate with the nose. Everything seems disoriented. One limb has nothing to do with another. Then, besides the physical sheath, we have a vital sheath, mental sheath and psychic sheath. All of these also seem to act independently. But you also have to feel that there is a specific place where you receive all your strength, energy and determination so that you can run the fastest inwardly. Once again, that place is your heart and your soul.</p>
<p>Try to feel that all your strength, all your determination and will-power is in one particular place, here inside your heart. Feel that you don't exist at all except in this tiny place. You don't have eyes, you don't have a nose, you don't have anything. Intensity will come only when you feel that your entire existence is concentrated at one particular place and not scattered.</p>

But sometimes my mind makes me think that the spiritual life is just a wild goose chase, and then I feel sad and sort of lost. How can I maintain my aspiration at a high level all the time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know that the divine qualities of peace, light and bliss do exist. Most of you have come here to see a spiritual Master and to be with spiritual people. Only two or three have come out of curiosity. Your souls have brought you by making you feel that peace does exist, light does exist, bliss does exist. It is the victory of your soul's inner urge that has made you come.</p>
<p>Again, it is up to you to maintain this inner urge or to lose it. Your soul is victorious today, but this victory need not last. Tomorrow you may lose your inner cry. If you want to preserve today's inner victory, then you have to meditate again tomorrow and the day after. If you have a Master then try to get inner guidance from him. Every day when the time comes for you to meditate, just think of him for a few minutes and you are bound to get inspiration and aspiration.</p>
<p>To learn, we go to school. For every new endeavour a Master or guide is needed. If you do not have a Master, you should seek one. The sooner you get a Master, the better for your progress. You may feel that the time has not come for you to look for a Master because you are an absolute beginner. You want to lead a better and a higher life, but you are not prepared and you may feel that the Master will demand things from you that are beyond your capacity. In that case try to read spiritual books written by real spiritual Masters, not by mere philosophers or professors. If you read writings of spiritual Masters, their consciousness will enter into you. Then one day you will get inner awakening, and you will discover which path you should follow. Once you get your own realisation you won't need a teacher. At that time you will have all the inner capacities.</p>
<p>If you have to go somewhere far away, either a boat or a train or a plane will have to take you to your destination. If you don't know the way, somebody has to be your pilot. In the spiritual life you also need a guide and a path. Otherwise, today you will be inspired, but you won't know where to go. Today your vital will be stronger than your soul and no-one will be available to encourage you or inspire you. But if you have a guide and you are walking along the right path, then who can prevent you from reaching the goal?</p>
<p>If you do not have a path, your progress is bound to be very slow. One day you may even become totally disgusted and give up. Then you will say that the spiritual life is all useless; there is no goal. But once you have found your path, please stick to it. If you change your path every day or every month you will never reach your goal. Of course, if you have found a path that is not fulfilling you, you have every right to change. You have to be absolutely convinced that the path you are following is the right path for you. If you are in school and you don't like the school that you go to, you can leave and go to some other school. But if you make a habit of changing from school to school, then you will not be able to get a proper education. Once you are satisfied with a school, do not attend other schools out of curiosity. In spirituality you do not have to have ten teachers. God-realisation, Self-discovery, is only one subject: therefore one teacher, one realised Master, is enough to take you to your goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What does it mean when you have a pain in your chest when you meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What does it mean when you have a pain in your chest when you meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, you must be sure that there is no physical ailment — nothing wrong with your chest. If you know that there is nothing wrong with you physically, then if you feel pain at the time of meditation, you have to feel that you are not breathing properly when you are meditating. You are breathing in an abnormal way and this abnormal way of breathing comes when you are trying to pull light beyond your capacity. When you do that you have to feel that you are going against the law of your inner necessity. You should never try to pull light into your being. Just open yourself and allow the light to enter into you naturally and also to go back to its own region freely. When you have enough purity and you have one-pointed aspiration for God, for realisation of the highest Truth, then you will see that no matter how much light enters or wants to enter into you, you will have no pain.</p>
<p>Your entire outer existence has to be totally dedicated to the spiritual life. If you really want God for God's sake, then there can be no pain during your meditation. If pain comes, then you have to feel that the vital wants something which is not approved by the soul. Usually we make a deplorable mistake when we say that a particular truth is coming from the soul or the inner being. Our vital is very clever and at times treacherous. In a clever way it makes us feel that the message we are getting in our physical mind is coming directly from the soul, which is not true. In your case sometimes the vital is acting without the approval of the soul. That is to say, the soul wants you to do something but the vital is telling you to do something else. Your physical mind is becoming unconsciously one with the vital. It thinks that the message, the light, the wisdom is coming from the soul — which is not true. Again, I must say that the soul need not offer its messages to your mind through the heart. You can get messages directly through your soul. Many times you have done it. But sometimes you don't listen to these messages. Sometimes you take the messages of the vital as the soul's messages, and sometimes you try to pull beyond your capacity.</p>
<p>What should you do to correct these mistakes? You should try to make your life a life of inner sacrifice. When you feel that you have become sacrifice itself, you will see that the vessel you have inside you is automatically enlarging itself. Then, inside the chest, inside the heart, the soul will be able to bloom like the lotus. When the heart vessel expands, you will feel no pain in your chest, no matter how much light enters.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes real physical pain inside the heart comes from the depth of your soul. This happens when your mission on earth is very high, but in fact you are accomplishing nothing. When the soul's aim is very lofty and sublime but the vital and physical are consciously negating the manifestation of the soul's loftiest aim, then you can feel most intense pain in your heart. At that time you see that there are two opposing parties and you are torn between the progressive soul and the aggressive vital; between the loving heart and the lethargic body. The soul and the heart are on one side, the vital and the physical on the other side, and you become one with the doubting and fearful mind. You do not take any side. Then, you are bound to feel pain inside your heart. This is real psychic pain. Psychic pain is good in a sense because it tells us that we are not fulfilling our inner possibilities. If you can make your outer life more pure and your inner life more secure on the basis of self-awakening and self-enlargement, then you will not experience pain. The psychic pain you have owing to your unconscious or conscious unwillingness will be transformed into sweetest joy and delight. The pain you have due to lack of receptivity will be transformed into boundless receptivity. Sacrifice means oneness — the oneness of the finite with the infinite. So, do not pull — do not push — let your life of inner sacrifice take care of your outer existence. Then there can be no pain anywhere.</p>

Can you tell me why that is and how I can get rid of it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are pulling beyond your capacity. Everybody has an inner vessel. You are trying to pull light from above beyond your capacity. When peace, light and bliss are forced into you, your vessel begins to give way because its capacity is very limited. First you have to make your inner vessel larger, much larger than it is now. How will you do this? You will try to aspire quietly, sincerely, devotedly. Do not pay any attention to the time limit. When you are in a position to meditate most intensely and soulfully for five minutes that is the best length of time for you. If you try to meditate intensely for half an hour, that is beyond your capacity. At that time if you continue to pull light from above, there will be a struggle between your heart and your mind. The mind is pulling and pulling, but the heart knows its capacity. The mind is putting the heart into difficulties. It is like the husband who brings all his friends home unexpectedly and asks his wife to give them a meal, although she is not at all prepared. In this way the mind pulls light, although the mind knows perfectly well that the heart-vessel will not be able to hold all this light or retain it. But the mind is a greedy fellow, so it just grabs as much as it can and brings it into the heart although it is beyond the capacity of your inner vessel. So when you meditate, meditate for a short time at first and see the heart's capacity for receptivity. Then do not allow the mind to try to pull down anything by force.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When it is a matter of spiritual principles you and your husband should feel as one. When you don't feel oneness, if your husband's lack of aspiration tortures you, immediately feel that your dearest is God. In that way you are safe. This is only a temporary cure but you have to have patience. If the Supreme wants you and your husband to stay together, when suffering comes, when anger comes, when frustration comes, at that time be clever; have patience. Without patience we can't accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Patience is a river waiting for the time when aspiration will dawn. Whether the time will come tomorrow or two years from now, we don't know. Aspiration is bound to dawn eventually because it is something divine and necessary for the transformation of your husband's nature. The Supreme is bound to give it to him but at His choice Hour. Your time is this moment, but his time may be later. In the spiritual life you should meditate, but you should not expect anything. You should have patience. If you have patience, you will be able to deal with any situation as long as God wants you to.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Undoubtedly you will overcome this problem, but what you need is patience. You have just plunged into the spiritual life. When you start studying in kindergarten, you have to realise that it will take you sixteen, eighteen or twenty years to get your Master's degree. If you want your Master's degree right now, how can the teacher give it to you? Right now you have barely started your spiritual journey. You cannot expect to get everything you want from God immediately. God is not indifferent; He simply has His own divine Hour. If you get whatever you want without waiting for the proper hour, without developing your aspiration, you will not value it. If a father gives thousands of dollars to a young child, the child will not use it properly; he will just squander it. In your case also, you are still a beginner, a very young spiritual child. It is the father's concern to do the right thing for the child at the right time. So the Supreme is bound to give you whatever you need at His choice Hour. It may take a few months, it may take a few years, but when the Hour strikes you will get everything from God.</p>
<p>If you do not get the things that you want right now, do not lose heart, do not be disappointed and disheartened. Sometimes you become aggressive in your prayer and you try to pull and push. In the spiritual life it is very bad to pull or push beyond your capacity. You just have to do your part in the best way you can and let God do His part in His own way. Your part is your daily meditation. God's part is to fulfil you, but at His choice Hour. You are doing the right thing by accepting the spiritual life, but you need to develop patience, which is God's Light operating in you. God is only waiting for the right moment in our inner development to shower His infinite Blessings on us. We need patience because we want to get everything done in the twinkling of an eye. But God will only give us what we want when the right moment arrives.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do we need to use our will in our spiritual journey?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do we need to use our will in our spiritual journey?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It all depends. If we use the will of our mind, it will not be very effective. It will not last. There is also the will of the heart, and of the vital. There may even be a physical will which comes from the subtle body. If we use the will of the vital, it may be aggressive rather than dynamic, and it may actually interfere with our progress. Even the heart's will may not be lastingly effective. Only the soul's will can inspire our aspiration with a burning flame. If we use the soul's will, then nothing can stand in our way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can self-effort ever be detrimental to our meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can self-effort ever be detrimental to our meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Self-effort is not detrimental. You must not make friends with inertia. You have to put forth some effort in order to go deep within. Otherwise you will just relax and take a nap and then you will say that God has meditated for you. While you are praying and meditating sincerely and soulfully, then only can the Supreme act in and through you. You have to co-operate.</p>
<p>Sooner or later you will get intuition. In the meantime God has given you intelligence. If you get up early in the morning, then you will be inspired to meditate; if you get up at eleven o'clock your inspiration will be gone. We have to use our common sense. We have to make the effort to get up early in the morning if we want to have a good meditation, and we have to meditate during the day or in the evening as well if we want to make considerable progress.</p>
<p>But you should also feel that if you are determined to do something, actually there is somebody else within you who will do it. You are not the doer; you are the instrument. Somebody else is acting in and through you, and that Somebody is the Supreme.</p>
<p>The Supreme will do everything for you, true, but you have to prepare yourself for Him. You have to prepare the field within you; then only will the farmer come and plough. If you do not make yourself into a field, then the farmer will not be able to cultivate, and you will never reap the bumper crop of divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I am meditating in the morning and feel sleepy, it is a real struggle to concentrate. But if I don&#039;t struggle, then there is complacency.

But if I don&#039;t struggle, then there is complacency. How can I prevent this feeling of struggling with sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You must choose between the life of struggle and the life of sincere aspiration. On one side is aspiration and on the other side is this feeling of struggling. Try to feel on the strength of your heart's sincerity that aspiration is your only choice. The moment you take the side of aspiration, I tell you, it is bound to be stronger and it will win the battle. Right now neither side is the permanent winner, but if you can make aspiration the permanent winner, then struggle will totally leave you.</p>
<p>Early in the morning when you are meditating, please feel that your Master is there. This is not false imagination. You must keep his living presence inside you. If you have that kind of feeling, that he is physically present, then you will not sleep during meditation. If you feel that you can only meditate when your Master is actually in front of you, then I tell you it will be impossible for you to meditate. If you need his physical presence to give you a good meditation, that is a terrible insult to your soul and to your Master's soul. Your soul will feel that you are useless and your Master's soul will feel that you are more helpless than an infant. Even a child feels his mother's presence protecting him when she is not in sight.</p>
<p>Please feel that physical presence is not needed at all; only spiritual presence is necessary. If you can meditate well at home then you will always be able to meditate well. Otherwise your meditation or will always be uncertain.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Forgive me, but you have not yet developed the capacity to meditate lying down. None of my disciples has come to that stage yet. There is still too much inertia in you. My meditation can be as powerful when I am lying down as when I am sitting in front of you. But only when you are realised or on the verge of realisation can you meditate while lying in bed. The tricky mind makes you feel that you are meditating but it is not actual meditation. It is just a feeling of peace or quietude, but not actually meditation.</p>
