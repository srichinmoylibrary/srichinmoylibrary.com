<p><em>[Left stage: courtyard of Sribas' house; right stage: room adjoining the courtyard.]</em></p>
<p><em>(Chaitanya is singing "Hari Bol, Hari Bol" and dancing in ecstasy with his followers in the courtyard of Sribas, a dear disciple of his. All of a sudden from inside the house is heard wailing and screaming. Sribas leaves the party and runs into the house. His wife is in tears; other relatives are also weeping.!</em></p>
<p>WIFE: Our only son! Our only son is lost forever! What can I do? What can I do?</p>
<p>SRIBAS: Why are you crying? Why are you weeping? What is there to cry about? His time has come. That is why he has gone to the other world. Today the Lord is dancing in our courtyard. Even the worst possible sinner will go directly to Heaven if he dies here. Since our son left the world from here, he will undoubtedly be happy. If you really love your son, then be happy, be delighted. Join us in our singing and dancing, for here, today, the Lord is with us.</p>
<p>WIFE: This is not the time to listen to your philosophy. We have lost our only son. I have love for our Master, Sri Chaitanya. But when one's only son dies, it is impossible to maintain the same love for the Master and the same faith in the Master.</p>
<p>SRIBAS: You are crying, and our relatives are crying. But our Lord is dancing in ecstasy. He is in a divine consciousness. If he hears your crying and wailing, and comes back to his normal consciousness because of it, then I shall throw myself into the Ganges. If you put an end to his ecstatic dance, then I shall put an end to my life!</p>
<p><em>(The wife calms down. Other relatives are still crying.)</em></p>
<p>SRIBAS <em>(to the others):</em> We have lost our dearest; we have lost our only son. But my wife and I are not crying. If you have to cry, then leave our house. It is we who have suffered the loss. But to us it is no loss; it is a real gain, a real reward, because today my Lord has come to my house. Now it is not my responsibility to think of my son. My only responsibility is to think of my Master. My Master will take care of my son. So if you want to cry and weep, then all of you leave this house. This is not the place for you.</p>
<p><em>(Sribas goes back to the garden and starts singing and dancing with the others. All of a sudden, Sri Chaitanya stops singing and dancing.)</em></p>
<p>CHAITANYA: I do not know what, but something has gone wrong with me. Has anything happened at Sribas' house? <em>(To Sribas.)</em> Has any calamity taken place in your house?SRIBAS: Lord, on the day that you have blessed my home with your divine presence, how can there be any calamity here?</p>
<p>ANOTHER FOLLOWER: Lord, something has happened.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: What has happened?</p>
<p>FOLLOWER: Something serious has happened.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: What is it?</p>
<p>FOLLOWER: Sribas' son has died.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: When? When?</p>
<p>FOLLOWER: An hour ago.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Now why didn't you tell me?</p>
<p>FOLLOWER: You were communing with Lord Krishna, my Lord. We didn't want to put an end to your ecstatic dance. We didn't dare to do it. And why should we have done it? To us your dance is infinitely more important than this death.</p>
<p>SRIBAS: To me your ecstatic dance is all-important. The death of my son is of no importance in comparison.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA <em>(starts crying):</em> He who can forget the loss of his only son in my presence-how can I forget his sacrifice? How can I appreciate his heart enough? How can I admire his heart enough? Sribas, you are really a man of divine sacrifice. I have never seen a man like you. Whose sacrifice can equal yours?</p>
<p>SRIBAS: Lord, there is no sacrifice on my part. For me there is only you. You have come to my home. Today is the happiest day of my life, the greatest day of my life.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Sribas, please go and bring the child. Let me see him.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Sribas. He returns carrying his son and followed by his wife. He places the child in front of the Master. Chaitanya looks at the child and concentrates on him.)</em></p>
<p>CHILD: Lord, it was Your wish that I should die Who can violate Your law?</p>
<p><em>(Everyone is astonished to hear the dead child talking.)</em></p>
<p>CHILD: You brought me, Lord, into this world of Yours, and it is You who are sending me to the other world, which is equally Yours. Who is my father, who is my mother, if not You? You are the eternal Father; You are the eternal Mother. I bow to You, O Lord. I am going to Your other home.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Sribas, now your child's soul has left the body. He has gone to my other world. I have a place ready for him in Heaven. I will take care of him there as I am taking care of you, your wife and all your spiritual sisters and brothers here. Sribas, you had only one son. Now you have two sons. I am your son and my dearest disciple, Nityananda, is your son. One son has gone to the other world; two sons will take his place here.</p>
<p><em>(Sribas touches the feet of Chaitanya then dances with joy.)</em></p>
<p>WIFE <em>(touching Chaitanya's feet):</em> Lord, in You I see my child. In You I see the Heavens. In You I see the entire universe. Today I see not only Your physical presence, but Your universal Reality as well.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Today you have proved to be the real counterpart of Sribas. His aspiration and your aspiration have become totally one today. I shall carry both of you deep inside my heart and lead you to the abode of Hari.</p>
<p><em>(Chaitanya blesses Sribas' wife with joy and pride.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Chaitanya is in Krishna consciousness.)</em></p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Sribas, Sribas! Where is my flute? Where is my flute? Give me my flute.</p>
<p>SRIBAS: My Lord, the Gopis have stolen your flute.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: The Gopis? Where are they? Where are my Gopis? Where is my Radha? Where is she? Where is she?</p>
<p><em>(Enter Shachi, Chaitanya's mother. Seeing his divine consciousness, she immediately bows down and touches his feet.)</em></p>
<p>SHACHI: O my son, O Nimai, you are no longer Nimai. You are no longer my son, Nimai. You are Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna Himself.</p>
<p><em>(Shachi sings. )</em></p>

<p>Jibana nadi tire dhire dhire<br /> Oi ase mor priyatama<br /> Benu hate madhur prate oi ase<br /> Praner jata asha<br /> Jata bhalobasa<br /> Ranga oi sri charane<br /> Sapi aji tomai nami</p>


<p>Behold, with His Flute in His Hand,<br /> My Beloved slowly is coming<br /> to the bank of my life-river<br /> In today's morning sweet.<br /> All my life's hope, All my life's love,<br /> To Your Power-red Feet divine I offer,<br /> And to You I bow and bow.</p>

<p>CHAITANYA: Mother, I am so proud of you. This is the first time that you have touched my feet on your own. Previously I used to ask you to come and touch my feet when I was in Krishna consciousness. But today you have come and touched my feet spontaneously. Mother, I am so proud of you. You have seen me in my highest consciousness, and you know what I am.</p>
<p>SHACHI: My son, I know, I know what you are. You are God. But still I will never forget even for a moment that you are also my son, my darling. You have blessed me by coming into my family, and immortalised me by being my son. I know that one day you will leave me. You will renounce the world. You will take to <em>sannyasa.</em> You will follow the path of renunciation. I tell you, my son, the human in me will miss you and suffer, but the divine in me will be proud of you, knowing that you are liberating mankind from ignorance and giving men a new life. You are putting an end to their life of suffering and granting them the life of Bliss.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Mother, the human in you will not miss me either, because I will transform the human in you into the divine. Wherever I am, Mother, your physical consciousness will feel my presence. I shall eternally remain within you and around you. You will feel my physical presence too, Mother. My subtle physical presence will be around you all the time, I assure you.</p>
<p>SHACHI: My son, I know you are God. You can do everything and you will do everything, not only for me but for all of humanity. You are not only my joy and my pride; you are also the joy and pride of the entire universe. You and your creation are inseparable. When I look at your creation I see how great you are. And when I look at you yourself, I see how compassionate you are. In your creation I see the miracle of your indomitable power. In you I see the endless flood of compassion.</p>

<p><em>(The palace of the Mogul Emperor Akbar.)</em></p>
<p>EMPRESS: Akbar, may I know in what you are so deeply absorbed?</p>
<p>AKBAR: I am absorbed in the thought of Chaitanya.</p>
<p>EMPRESS: Very often I see that you think of him and meditate on him. Have you forgotten that he is a Hindu? What will people think of you? What will your subjects think of you when they come to know that you meditate on a Hindu so deeply and so often?</p>
<p>AKBAR: Let them think whatever they want of me, but I can't live without loving Chaitanya. His divine love has conquered my heart. His divine mystic dance has illumined my heart. He is the Lord of my aspiring heart. The depth of his love I can never express. I beg of him only to give me a drop from the sea of his nectar-love. He has already achieved by his boundless love what I am trying to do so desperately. In his heart Hindus and Muslims have become one. He has realised Allah; he has realised the highest Truth.</p>
<p>EMPRESS: You are great. Everybody admires you. I don't think you have to be an admirer of Chaitanya.</p>
<p>AKBAR: They admire me, but their admiration of me is not as sincere as my admiration of Chaitanya. They admire my outer power. I admire Chaitanya's inner power. My power destroys everything. Chaitanya's power loves everything, loves everyone, fulfils everyone. This is the difference between Chaitanya's power and my power. My power wants to destroy the world. My power wants to lord it over the world. My power wants name and fame. His power wants to love the world, become the world and fulfil the world. O Empress, I shall tell you what I feel about Sri Chaitanya. He is not an ordinary mortal like us. He is the son of Truth. He is Truth itself. And this Truth is Love. This Truth is oneness with Allah and His Creation. This Love my heart constantly needs. Only the dust of Chaitanya's feet can transform my life into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>GOVINDA: I have brought your food. Here is <em>prasad</em> for you. <em>(Haridas gives him a thankful smile.</em> ) Don't worry, you will be all right. Eat the <em>prasad</em>.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: I can't eat my <em>prasad</em> yet.</p>
<p>GOVINDA: Why not?</p>
<p>HARIDAS: Because I have not yet finished my <em>japa</em> [repetition of a sacred name]. Today is the first day I have ever done my <em>japa</em> lying down. Today I am unable to get up from my bed, so I am doing my japa lying down, and it is not at all intense.</p>
<p>GOVINDA: You are sick. How can you expect your <em>japa</em> to be intense, Haridas? First you have to get well. As soon as you become strong, your intensity will return.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: No, I can't eat the food. Oh, but I have to eat the <em>prasad</em> of my Lord Chaitanya, or it will be an insult to him. At the same time, if I eat it before finishing my <em>japa,</em> then also it will be an insult to him. In that case I shall eat a little, very little of his <em>prasad</em>, and then continue doing my <em>japa.</em> In that way I will not insult my Lord by rejecting his sanctified food and, at the same time, I will not insult him by eating his food without earning it by doing my spiritual disciplines. <em>(Takes a small mouthful of</em> prasad.)</p>
<p><em>(Enter Chaitanya.</em> )</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: How are you today, Haridas?</p>
<p>HARIDAS: Lord, physically I am worse, but spiritually I am better. Spiritually I feel I have more love for you, I have more faith in you. But forgive me, my Lord, today for the first time in my life I have not been able to complete my <em>japa.</em> I am unable to get up from bed.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Don't worry, Haridas. Countless times you have done <em>japa.</em> Lord Krishna is most pleased with you and I am most pleased with you. You have already achieved perfection in your spiritual life. Now you don't have to do <em>japa</em> at all. You don't need any meditation. This is the time for you to take rest and wait for the call from the Beyond, from the other world.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: My Lord, I am ready for your call from the other world. But you have to fulfil a desire of mine. Will you not fulfil my last desire? You have always pleased me; you have always spoken highly of me, although I don't deserve your praise at all. I came of a very low family. I was an untouchable. Everybody hated me. But you lifted me up. You gave me status. You gave me name and fame. You made me very close to you. My Lord, this life of mine is only a life of gratitude to you. You have made me what I am. What I was is unthinkable. What I have become is all through your compassion.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Your power of receptivity has deeply pleased my heart of love and compassion. Now tell me, please. I want to know your last desire.</p>
<p>HARIDAS: My last desire is that you should place your feet on my heart before I die. You are my whole world. When you place your feet on my heart, I will get infinite Joy, Peace and Bliss. You have been telling us for the past few months that you will soon leave the world. But my only desire is for you to place your feet on my heart and let me die before you, my Lord. That is my last desire.</p>
<p><em>(Chaitanya embraces Haridas.)</em></p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Govinda, go and bring a few disciples of mine. Let us sing <em>Hari Bol.</em> Let us sing our <em>kirtan</em> [religious song in honour of Sri Krishna].</p>
<p><em>(Exit Govinda. Reenter with ten disciples. They start singing Hari Bol, Hari Bol. Chaitanya places his foot on Haridas' heart.)</em></p>
<p>HARIDAS: My Lord, you are my world. You are my light. You are my heart's breath. You are my soul's delight.</p>
<p><em>(Haridas dies. Chaitanya lifts up Haridas' body and begins to dance, singing</em> Hari Bol, Hari Bol.)</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: He has gone to my other home. I have two homes: one on earth and one in Heaven. He has gone to my Heavenly home. He will make everything ready for my arrival. In the spiritual life there is no caste; there is no rank. He came of a low family, but in God's Eye we are all one. Truth is not the monopoly of the Brahmins. Truth is everybody's property. He who realises the Truth is above all others. Haridas has realised the Truth. He is above everything, above everybody. To have a disciple like Haridas is something. To fulfil his last desire is something. To be with him in the other world is something. Something good. Something divine. Something immortal.</p>

<p><em>(Chaitanya and Nityananda are walking along the street singing Hari Bol with utmost joy.)</em></p>
<p>NITYANANDA: O Lord Gauranga, your rise in the firmament of Bengal at this time, a time when our province is shrouded in a mist of superstition, ignorance and pessimism, is a supreme blessing from Providence. The supernal Light that you are throwing on our slumbering and downtrodden country is stirring its children to a new life. Your work and your miracles are not done to arrest the attention of people, but to bestow your love, your compassion on poor suffering humanity. To you a sinner is not an object of ire or contempt, but an object of compassion and love.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: In my philosophy, Nityananda, we need not extinguish the senses. We should keep the senses intact. But also, we should never forget that we have to keep them under proper control.</p>
<p>NITYANANDA: Ah! Here come those two fiends in human shape, the brothers Jagai and Madhai.</p>
<p><em>(Madhai, the younger and fiercer of the two, is holding an earthen jar. Suddenly he flings the jar at Nityananda, striking and wounding him on the forehead.)</em></p>
<p>NITYANANDA: You have struck me. My forehead is wounded and bleeding from the blow of this jar. But even so I am beside myself with joy, because finally Lord Gauranga's attention will be drawn to you two, the worst possible sinners, and his redeeming Grace will at last be showered on you. His mere touch or look performs the miracle of miracles.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA <em>(flying into a rage, to Madhai):</em> How dare you strike my Nityananda? I shall invoke my <em>chakra</em> to punish you, Madhai, for I will not tolerate the suffering of my true disciple, who is dearer to me than my own life!</p>
<p>NITYANANDA: My Lord, I do not want salvation just now. First save the greatest sinners in the world, and then you can take my case into consideration.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Nityananda, indeed you are forgiveness incarnate. But my rage is not pacified. I am bent on punishing Madhai.</p>
<p><em>(Chaitanya turns toward Madhai. Madhai stares at him for a long time as if spellbound. Silence falls on the group.)</em></p>
<p>MADHAI <em>(aside):</em> At the mere sight of Chaitanya, I feel a great change coming over me. My inside is being clawed as earth is clawed by a cat. His silent influence is changing my life. <em>(To Chaitanya.)</em> O Chaitanya, my Lord, I don't ask forgiveness of you, nor am I afraid of punishment. Let it come, and I shall welcome it. Only tell me, is there any way, any penance, by which I can, at any future period, attain to your lotus feet? Only tell me the way, if there be any, and then cast me off.</p>
<p>CHAITANYA: Madhai, your prayer is at once striking and significant. <em>(Blesses Madhai and Jagai.)</em> Both you and your brother, Jagai, will be transformed into the holiest of holy souls. There can be no shadow of a doubt that this miracle that I am envisioning will soon become the most evident Truth.</p>
<p>MADHAI: O Lord Chaitanya, a life replete with miracles is yours; and ours is a life filled with gratitude to you, O Love incarnate.</p>
<p>(Madhai sings.)</p>

<p>He jogiraj dikkha amai dao go<br /> aji diktha<br /> Rupantarer amar bani pabo<br /> aji shikkha<br /> Ghurbona ar dure dure<br /> Nachbo shudhu hriday pure<br /> Gaibo giti premer sure<br /> Dekhbo amai pran mukure<br /> Nirabatar lagi ami magi aji bhikkha</p>


<p>You of the highest magnitude, initiate me.<br /> Today offer me Your initiation.<br /> Today I shall learn the immortal message of<br /> transformation from You.<br /> I shall not wander anymore in the farthest<br /> corners of the world.<br /> I shall only dance in the city of my heart.<br /> Inside the city of my heart I shall sing songs<br /> of Love Divine.<br /> And I shall see myself in the mirror of my<br /> sanctified heart.<br /> Today I beg of You to offer me only one<br /> thing: silence, silence.<br /> O You of the highest magnitude,<br /> initiate me today.</p>
