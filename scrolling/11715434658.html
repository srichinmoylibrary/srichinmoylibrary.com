<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Outwardly you can say that. But, as I said before, I received inspiration from within. Running long distance is like being part of a family — thousands of people are going together. Sprinting is a matter of a single individual, all by himself in a lane. He cannot come out of his lane. Otherwise he will be disqualified or there will be a real accident.</p>
<p>In long distance, the runners are going slowly and steadily towards their goal, and there is constant joy. In the New York City Marathon, they say that every runner is a winner. This slogan I admire very much — every runner is a winner. Already the champions have finished, and we are cheerfully going on, ten miles behind them. Then, when we come to the finish, the organisers console us and inspire us by saying that every runner is a winner.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life also, everybody is a winner — provided you do not give up. If you give up, you are not a winner. Slow and steady wins the race. Everybody cannot have the same capacity, the same standard. You will go according to your speed, and I will go according to my speed. If you and I can maintain our cheerfulness and reach our destination, it does not matter whether you arrive first or I arrive first. We are both winners because we are competing with ourselves on the strength of our faith in ourselves and in God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For us, there is only one God. Spiritual Masters of the highest order are but manifestations of God. God is like a tree. A tree has many branches. Each branch is powerful, but without the trunk, there can be no branches. God is the trunk of the tree. If one particular religion claims that their saviour is the only saviour, we cannot agree with them. Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, the Saviour Christ and other great spiritual Masters and leaders of various religions are all manifestations of God.</p>
<p>To me, each religion is like a house. Today you have come from your house, and I have come from my house. Together we are meeting at this restaurant, Annam Brahma. In exactly the same way, all religions have to feel that they are only representing different houses. But we can all meet together in the same inner school.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you pray and meditate sincerely, you immediately see that God has expanded your heart. At that time, for you there is no Hinduism, no Judaism, no Christianity, no Buddhism. It is all oneness. In oneness there is joy. Division is all frustration. If we sincerely pray and meditate, we will never dare to say that ours is the only religion worth following, that ours is the only saviour who will be able to save the entire world. We will simply say that ours is a way of life. If you like it, well and good. There are so many boats to take you to the Golden Shore. If you like this particular boat, you can enter into the boat. If you like another boat, you are more than welcome to enter into that boat. But the destination remains the same.</p>
<p>Let us take Rome as our destination. If we want to fly there, we can fly. If we want to take a boat, we can. Or if we want to go via another means, we can go. It is up to us to make the choice. You cannot say that just because I have taken the boat, I will never be able to reach Rome. No, we will all reach the destination at God's choice Hour.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: With team sports the way they are — football, hockey and so on — there is considerable violence. Should these sports continue the way they are constituted or should there be a change in them to make them less violent?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: With team sports the way they are — football, hockey and so on — there is considerable violence. Should these sports continue the way they are constituted or should there be a change in them to make them less violent?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything depends on the inner awakening. We can play these sports in a foul way. Again, we can play absolutely clean games based on our oneness with the other players. Ordinarily, most players want to win by hook or by crook. They will not hesitate in the least to adopt foul means. The same individuals, if they enter into the spiritual life, will hesitate ten million times before they adopt foul means. This is the difference. Once their conscience is awakened, they will say, "I will not adopt any foul means." Their aspiring hearts and evolved lives will not permit them to adopt foul means. Before people enter into the spiritual life, the goal is to win by hook or by crook — by any means possible. Then, once we enter into the spiritual life, we do our best to become a conscious instrument of God. Previously our goal was to be first, nothing else. But now we embody the Saviour Christ's supreme message: "Let Thy Will be done."</p>
<p>To come back to your question, it depends on the development of consciousness. A game can be played properly, with mutual respect and love. Again, it can be played with a destructive attitude right from the beginning. In that case, it is the destructive mind that is operating, not the heart. If the heart is operating, you know nobody is going to consciously harm anyone. But when you play with the mind, it is all division and destruction. The heart will play the same game, but with a different attitude.</p>
<p>If the hearts of these players come to the fore, they will play in the right way. Then they are bound to get extra joy from the game. Right now they are not getting joy from the game as such. They are getting joy only when they become winners. Then they feel that they have conquered the whole world. When they lose, they feel that they have lost the whole world. This moment they are the possessors of the world; next moment they are the losers of the world. But if we are seekers, God-lovers, truth-lovers, then when we play, everything is a joy. It is like children playing; they get joy from the playing itself. If you place twenty children in a beautiful garden, they will play all the time so happily.</p>
<p>The game itself has to give happiness, not our so-called success. If we depend on our success for our happiness, then today we will be happy and tomorrow we will feel miserable. But if we play the game cheerfully, then that will be at once our happiness and our success.</p>

 <p>
SCA 1090-1095. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions at Annam Brahma restaurant on 8 November 1997.</p>
<h2>Question: Today I felt inwardly attacked and it was very difficult for me.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all attacked every day. I am attacked more than you are. I place all the attacks at the Feet of my Lord Beloved Supreme. You also should do the same. When an attack comes, grab it and place it at the Feet of the Supreme. This is the only way I save myself. There is no other way to solve any problem or to counter any attack.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we meditate with you, specially when we have a walk-past meditation, should we concentrate more on receiving divine qualities from you or on giving our undivine qualities to you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we meditate with you, specially when we have a walk-past meditation, should we concentrate more on receiving divine qualities from you or on giving our undivine qualities to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can try to do both at the same time. With one hand you give something, and with another hand you receive something. When you pass by me, at that time it is better to give first — to empty the vessel — and then take. First give me what you have and what you are, and then I shall give you what I am supposed to give you.</p>
<p>You have plenty of time to prepare yourself. About fifteen or twenty metres you have to walk before you come to me. During that time prepare yourself.</p>
<p>The first time you pass by me, I see the physical aspect — whether you are in a good consciousness or a low consciousness. The second time I do not see anything. I go into my highest consciousness. Then whatever you can receive, you receive.</p>
<p>Also, if you fold your hands, the mind at least makes an attempt to go higher and deeper. I do not receive your devotion, I do not need your devotion, and I do not expect your devotion. But if you have even an iota of devotion, it will expedite your spiritual journey. Devotion is not simply a matter of folding your hands. Some people can fold their hands and there is no devotion. Again, others will not fold their hands, but they will have devotion.</p>
<p>Please try to bring forward your devotion. And, if you already have devotion, then please try to increase it. Our philosophy is to transcend. If you keep the mind clear, the heart pure and the life very simple, then you can easily have devotion. And vice versa: if you have devotion, then the mind will be clear, the heart will be pure and the life will be simple.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Some of your Bengali songs have extremely beautiful melodies, but when I learn the meaning, I am not inspired to sing them. Sometimes they embody a degree of helplessness — for example, Bedanai bhara jibana khanire. For me, songs that have a more positive meaning are easier to sing.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Some of your Bengali songs have extremely beautiful melodies, but when I learn the meaning, I am not inspired to sing them. Sometimes they embody a degree of helplessness — for example, &lt;em&gt;Bedanai bhara jibana khanire.&lt;/em&gt; For me, songs that have a more positive meaning are easier to sing." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not blame you. Most of the time I say to take the positive aspect. I say, "Go forward, go forward!" But there comes a time when we do feel helpless; we feel that we are like a babe in the woods. I wish to say that this helplessness is not a negative aspect. In fact, on rare occasions this helplessness is of great help to us.</p>
<p>The mind very often does not want to accept our helplessness. Knowing perfectly well that it is doing everything wrong, the mind runs to this side and that side like a mad elephant. The mind does not want to admit that it can make any mistake. So the mind has to come to a point where it is totally tired, completely exhausted. Then it says, "I have tried in every other way. I am helpless. Now let me try to invoke God." At that time helplessness helps us.</p>
<p>The heart can never be helpless because it always identifies itself with divinity. It has the capacity to identify itself with the Source, with the Supreme. That is why the heart is always positive. But the vital and mind sometimes become helpless. When the vital and mind become sincerely helpless, we can make progress. So from time to time if you can sing <em>Bedanai bhara</em> and other songs that express the idea that life is full of suffering, songs which are very painful, even pathetic, then it will help you. On rare occasions, if the mind can recognise its helplessness, then you will go forward.</p>
<p>The mind never wants to surrender. Even if you bring light in front of the mind, the mind does not want to surrender to the light. The mind has to be dealt with in various ways. If it does not want to accept light the way the heart accepts it, then there should be another way to make the mind feel that you are useless, you are hopeless. That is where some songs in which helplessness is being expressed — not only my songs, but songs by Ramprasad and others — can help us tremendously.</p>
<p>Even when we are helpless and useless, the mind does not want to acknowledge it. The heart, on the other hand, does acknowledge it. The heart surrenders very quickly, but the mind does not surrender. These songs about helplessness help the mind to surrender. True, if you know the meaning, there is no positive aspect in them, but I would not say they are negative. In a special way there is tremendous sweetness in them.</p>
<p>There are so many Indian devotional songs where you will be disheartened if you know the literal meaning. But their sweetness gives them a different meaning for the seekers. For example, there is one song that I play on my cello,</p>

<p><em>Ami phire ogo pather sandhane</em><br /><em>patha nahi dekha jaibo</em></p>

<p>The meaning is, "I am looking for a road. Still I have not found it. I am all in darkness." For years and years I have been playing this song. It is not my tune, but I get tremendous joy while I am playing it. You may ask what I am doing. Have I not found the road, not only for myself but also for my spiritual children? But this song has so much sweetness that it gives me boundless joy. In my childhood I learned some songs like this one, and still I play them. In that particular song the meaning gets worse at the end! It says, "All the light is engulfed by infinite darkness." This is the song that I start with on my cello.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, that line means "all around me is the melody of suffering." How much joy I get when I am singing those songs! I do not take them as negative. Only the helplessness aspect I see. There are two or three songs that I play on the cello which are so painful, but I do not get pain as such. Inside the pain I feel so much sweetness, and that sweetness helps me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is what you are saying now, but next moment are you going to say the same thing? When we are in a cheerful frame of mind, or when we have an iota of gratitude in our hearts, we say, "All our good qualities have come from God." Then the next moment we say to God, "I have prayed and meditated for twenty years. You have given me some good qualities, but You could have given me much more." Not only that, but we will say, "God, You have given me less than I deserve. I have prayed and meditated for so many years with no jealousy, no insecurity, no impurity. Now what have You given me in return?"</p>
<p>When we want to flatter God, we say in a tricky way, "You have given me everything." But this is more of a mental philosophy than a psychic realisation. Do we really feel it or is it only that we have studied a few books on philosophy? Usually, what comes to us spontaneously is the feeling, "I have done so much for You, God. In return, You have not given me enough."</p>
<p>If we really love God, we have to say, "I am doing everything for You unconditionally." When the word 'unconditional' becomes part and parcel of our life, then whatever we say is sincere. But if that unconditional feeling is not in the picture, then we are all liars, and it is very difficult for us to separate our falsehood from truth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your mind has to surrender to your heart. At every moment the heart is seeing a beautiful flower, whereas the mind is seeing a dry, dead tree. When you use the mind, you see a dead tree right in front of you, but when you use the heart, you see a most beautiful garden. Every time you meditate, imagine a garden with beautiful flowers. First imagine it right in front of you, and then try to imagine it inside your heart. In that way, the beauty and fragrance of the garden are bound to inspire you and make you feel that you are receiving something most precious.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Do you think that you can go to the Centre and just turn a switch? Meditation does not work like that.</p>
<p>Everything is preparation. If I want do to a long jump, first I have to warm up by doing stretching exercises and jogging. Similarly, during the day we have to prepare ourselves; we have to think of our spiritual life.</p>
