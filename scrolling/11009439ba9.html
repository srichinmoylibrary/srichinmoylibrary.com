<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this stage if you can do two hours, I will be more than happy, because you work very, very hard. You are an indispensable person in the store where you work, in the Divine Enterprise, so more than two hours is not necessary right now. And if you do not have that kind of time, you can divide it. If you cannot do one hour early in the morning and one hour in the evening, then meditate in four sessions or six sessions. In six sessions, easily you can pray and meditate for two hours.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Obedience, obedience! There is nothing more important than obedience. To give me joy, obedience is necessary, constant obedience. Feel that if your Master says, "Do this," you will do this. If your Master says, "Do not do that," you will not do that. When the Master finds cheerful obedience in a disciple, then he gets the whole world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How to increase sincerity, purity and humility?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How to increase sincerity, purity and humility?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have three problems? People are dying with only one problem, and you have three problems!</p>
<p>Your question is how to increase sincerity, purity and humility. Let us begin with sincerity. Think of a child who is two or three years old. This child has not started telling lies. When his mind becomes developed, then he will start telling lies. Think of a little child, and imagine you have become that child. By nature, a good child cannot tell lies. No matter what he does, he tells the truth. So if you want more sincerity, think of a child.</p>
<p>Next comes humility. If you want to increase your humility, think of a tree. A tree becomes so big, but it starts with humility, with a tiny seed. A tiny seed has to be humble because it is so tiny. Then gradually, gradually it becomes a huge banyan tree. Humility is like that. You have to feel that your origin is next to nothing. If you think of your origin, then you become humble.</p>
<p>I come of an Indian village. If I think of an Indian village, a tinier than the tiniest village, automatically humility comes. Now I have become well known! Thousands of disciples have joined our path. But if I think of my origin, my little family village called Shakpura, then humility comes sooner than at once. Always remember your humble origin. And the more we become successful, the more we have to become humble.</p>
<p>Look at a tree. When it does not give flowers and fruits, it stands straight and tall. But when it bears fruits and flowers, it bends. From the tree we learn that the higher and the greater we become, the more humble we have to be. Like the tree, we have to bend down. When we do something good, instead of feeling pride, we have to think of our origin. From a seed, we become a banyan tree. From a drop, gradually, gradually we can become the ocean. A little Shakpura village boy now is known practically all over the world. If I think of my origin, then I get tremendous joy. From that little seed, I have grown up into a big banyan tree.</p>
<p>Then comes purity. To increase your purity, you can place your hand, right or left, on your head and repeat "purity." Very fast repeat "purity, purity, purity, purity, purity, purity." Then you will feel that your whole being, your entire body, from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head, is only purity, purity, purity. Start with touching your head, your mind, because in the mind is impurity. Usually I say to chant slowly and soulfully, but at certain times you have to do it very fast. If you are angry, for example, as fast as possible you have to pray to God, "peace, peace, peace, peace." You can do it with a marching spirit: "left, right, left, right, left, right." Or you can run in place while chanting, if anger or impurity comes.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why am I afraid of myself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why am I afraid of myself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have a lower self and a higher self. Your lower self is afraid of your higher self. Your lower self feels that it is so bad and your higher self is so good. That is why you are afraid. But do not separate your lower self and higher self. Take your life as one self — nothing low, nothing high. Then you will not be afraid. Right now you are separating yourself. One part of you is very low and one part is very high, so you are in between. That is why you are afraid; you are lost. The best thing is to take your lower self and your higher self together as one self. If you are one, then you are not going to be afraid. But if you see yourself as two, the lower and the higher, then you are bound to be afraid. You will feel that you are not safe. Always think of yourself as one reality. Whether you are good or bad, you are only one person. Now you are separating yourself into two persons. Always think of yourself as one. Then you will not be afraid of yourself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First try to increase your inner thirst. As human beings, we are generally more often thirsty than hungry. We eat three times a day, but we drink, God knows, perhaps twenty times a day. Therefore, first things first: first, increase your inner thirst. Then, automatically, your hunger will follow. How to increase your inner thirst? Only shed tears, helpless tears. If you can offer helpless tears to God, then God will solve all your problems.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of your soul — not your body, not your vital or mind or anything else. While you are meditating, only feel that you are the soul, you are the soul, you are the soul. Then your soul will give you the best meditation. You do not have to define the soul or see it as a beautiful child. No! Only think of your entire body as the soul. Then the beauty, fragrance, light and delight of the soul will give you the best meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I get rid of my fear?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I get rid of my fear?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fear of what? That we have to know. Vastness can give us fear. Height can give us fear. Or, if we have done something wrong, we may be afraid that God will punish us in some way. Which kind of fear do you have?</p>
<p><em>Question: My fear comes from attachment. When I become attached to things, then I become afraid that one day everything will change and I will lose them.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When things change, fear does come. Only if we love God in His own Way can we remove this fear. We have to say, "God, You know what is best for me, what is best for the members of my family, what is best for everybody." If you can increase your love for God, then you will see that God is doing everything and will do everything for your good, for your good. The problem is, we always think that everything has to be done in our own way. Fear remains with us because we want to see something in our own way. We do not want to see it in God's Way.</p>
<p>If we become one with God's Way, there is no fear at all because we see God inside every change in our lives. We know He is doing everything for us, for our family, for everybody. Fear comes because we want to get the result in our own way. But when we surrender to God's Will, when God's Way becomes our way, then fear goes away and we become infinitely happier than we were when we wanted to have joy in our own way.</p>
<p>Do not think of fear, but think of your own faith in God, your own love for God. The more you have faith in God, the more you have love for God, the sooner your fear will go away. If we leave everything up to God, then God gives us what is necessary in order for us to make progress. As soon as we separate our individual will from God's universal Will, fear comes because we become responsible for our own desire. We only wonder, "Will my desire be fulfilled? How can it be fulfilled?" These kinds of rubbish questions come into our mind. But if we leave everything to God's Will, He becomes responsible for our aspiration. Then we have only to watch how God is operating in and through our aspiration-life.</p>
<p>You have to place fear itself at God's Feet, and not try to deal with it in your own way, with your mind. Right now, you say, "Oh, fear has come into my life! I have to do this, I have to do that." But when you do this or that, you see that still fear is there. You are changing your process to conquer fear, but it does not work. If fear has come into you, very gladly and very powerfully place it at the Feet of God. Then God will take away your fear and replace it with His Light to work in and through your life.</p>

MHDI 52-73. These questions were answered by Sri Chinmoy on 20 January 2006 at the Awana Kijal Golf and Beach Resort, Malaysia.</p>
<h2>Question: We were listening today to some of your writings that sound like reminiscences, and I was wondering if you will release these writings? Are you preparing your own autobiography?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have said so many things about my life, specially about my outer life. About my inner life I cannot say, because after God-realisation, every day is a big volume in the inner world. Before God-realisation, you can write your autobiography. But once you realise God, every day becomes such a thick volume that nobody will be able to write it down. Every minute, things are happening here, there, everywhere.</p>
<p>The inner biography or autobiography is simply impossible to write. Only a few experiences I have told, and in some of my earlier poems, my highest experiences I have tried to describe. Again, the highest spiritual experiences you cannot express in words — never! Nobody has been successful, nobody since the beginning of creation. No matter how great a poet the person is, no matter how great a writer he is, the highest experiences are far beyond the capacity of the human mind to grasp. Even the same person who had the highest realisation cannot grasp it with the mind. And for the hand to write it down is simply impossible, impossible. Higher than the highest experiences can never be described in words. To make an attempt is simply a joke. There are very few inner experiences that the mind can grasp, spiritual Masters say. That is why the highest experiences can never be written down in words.</p>
<p>In Sri Aurobindo's case, his autobiography was gathered from here and there, from his letters and conversations, and others gave it the name 'autobiography'. In my case, the things that I have said many, many times will eventually be printed in book form. True, at that time my own words will be there, so it will become an autobiography. But if other writers use their words to describe my life, then it will be a biography.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When your grandfather was dying, at that time he was very receptive. It has happened in a number of cases. Recently, the mother of one of my disciples was on her deathbed. She was seeing me all around, everywhere, but her daughter, who was in the same room, could not see me. The one who was dying was seeing me everywhere, but the one who had been praying for years, my disciple, could not see me. Her mother was telling her, “Look here! Your Master is looking at me! I am seeing him.”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was speaking in an affectionate way. Sometimes, if your daughter does not come to see me every day, if she misses two or three functions, then I say, "For years I have not seen you!" If I see her seat is empty, then when she appears, I say that. In that kind of affectionate way I speak with those who are in my circle.</p>
<p>In the inner world, some souls have a free access to come and see me. But if I do not see them for a week or two weeks, or for a month or so, then I exaggerate the fact by saying that I have not seen them for ages, the way I exaggerate on the physical plane. It is an affectionate way of speaking. It has nothing to do with reality, with the actual facts.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They have many things to do. In the inner world, the disciples of spiritual Masters pray for the Victory of God, the way they consciously strived for the Victory of God while they were on earth. Ordinary people pray for the fulfilment of their desires. On a daily basis they do not pray for the Victory of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we pray to God for His Victory, our mind will think stupid things. The mind will say, "Since God is omniscient and omnipotent, what can our prayer add to God's Victory?" But God feels, "Here is someone who cares for My Victory." When we pray to God, God will give us a Smile. But when we pray for God, for His Victory on earth, then He is more pleased, infinitely more pleased. When we pray to God, "Give me this," we are caring only for ourselves. But when we pray to God for God's Victory, then God cares for us more, because we are caring for Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I was just wondering if you could tell us something about your spiritual vision.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I was just wondering if you could tell us something about your spiritual vision." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> With my physical vision I cannot see who is sitting at the back of the room. That far I cannot see. Physical vision is so limited. But inside the physical vision is the inner vision. When you have inner vision, at that time you can see very far. Clearly you can see the farthest distance, and also you can see events that happened in the past.</p>
<p>In my case, my soul sees in and through me. My soul shows me certain things. It is like a telescope. The other day I was fooled! The subtle body of one disciple from Scotland took his physical form. He came and meditated right in front of me. His subtle body I could see so vividly, and he did absolutely the best meditation. Alas, when I was asking for him afterwards, I discovered, to my great surprise, that he was not physically here; he was at home in Scotland.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Over the millennia, has God&#039;s attitude towards humanity changed in any fundamental way?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Over the millennia, has God&#039;s attitude towards humanity changed in any fundamental way?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is like a mother. Her son may be dying; it may be a matter of only a few minutes or a few hours, but the mother still cherishes the hope that he will recover. Even until her son's last breath, the mother will say, "My son will be all right, my son will be cured." When we are very upset with the behaviour of human beings, when we are extremely disappointed and disgusted, when we have lost all hope, then we say stupid things. We declare that God has given up hope and God does not care for humanity the way He cared many years ago. Sometimes, when the governments of some countries are bad, we take it as proof that God has given up. But actually, as long as God keeps His Creation here on earth, He maintains the same hope, even to the last moment.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters over the years have predicted that there will be another period of destruction. They say the whole world will be destroyed because we are acting so badly. Because of mankind's misdeeds, they say, God has lost all interest in earth, so He will destroy the whole world. In all sincerity, I must disagree with these spiritual Masters. This world of ours is very vast. Even if there are numberless disasters, tsunamis and so forth, the world will not be destroyed.</p>
<p>God keeps hope as long as He keeps His Creation. As I said before, if the son is about to die, even then the mother maintains the hope that he will be all right. As long as God keeps this Creation, this earth planet, He will never give up hope, never give up hope.</p>
<p>It is we who lose hope because we want to see the truth in our way, but, alas, the truth comes and stands before us in a totally different way. We give undue importance to the way we see the future of the world. We feel that it is going to come to an end. But, I assure you, it is not true. As long as God wants to keep this earth planet alive, He will keep the same Hope, because He knows inside His Hope there is His Promise. In our hope, there is no promise. As soon as our hopes are shattered, we are doomed to disappointment. There is no promise inside our hope, but in God's case there is Promise. Promise looms large in His Hope, so He knows what is going to happen.</p>
<p>We do not know what is going to happen in the next moment, whereas God knows what is going to happen even in the distant future. That is why God never, never gives up hope. We human beings give up. If things do not go well in our own way, we lose hope immediately. In God's case, God never gives up Hope. If He had given up His Hope, then we would not exist here on earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many, many who are helping me unconditionally from the inner world. If the inner world had not been helping me on a regular basis, I would have been, by this time, in the inner world myself. I am being very, very frank. I am being helped, supported, by many, many inner beings, plus spiritual Masters of the highest order. They are all helping me, supporting me. Otherwise, this body would not have lasted.</p>
