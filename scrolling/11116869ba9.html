<p>After about four or five miles, I was breathing heavily as usual. A middle-aged man said to me, "Did you have a checkup with your doctor for your chest? Is your heart all right?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, yes!"</p>
<p>Then I said to myself, "O God, I am not going to run with the runners. I don't want to show people how tired I am." From then on I ran on the left side of the street. Most of the runners were running on the right side. There were still some runners on the left side, but very few in comparison.</p>
<p>There were many people who were breathing louder than I was. In the Athens Marathon that I ran a few years ago, there was one person breathing so heavily that you could hear him a hundred meters away.</p>
<p>After about seven or eight miles, I saw a man lying down by the side of the road. Two people were helping him. Then the ambulance came.</p>

<p>As I passed one point in the marathon, I remembered that at that same place two years ago I had got cramps. At that time I was practically lying down on the street while Pradhan and Nirvik were massaging me. After they massaged me, I could barely walk for three or four miles. I was absolutely miserable.</p>
<p>Before the marathon that year, a Chinese doctor had given a talk about how he had cured so many patients who had come to him. In spite of my cramps this doctor was two or three miles behind me.</p>
<p>This time nothing happened â€” no cramps or anything. I was absolutely flying. This is the difference between two years ago and now!</p>

<p>At one point during the marathon I saw a man who was in such pain and agony that he was walking. When you get cramps, you forget even your parents' names. When you use the car brake, you don't feel the car's pain. But when cramps put on the brakes, you feel the pain in your entire body.</p>

<p>While I was running, six or seven people recognised me. Two or three stopped and shook hands with me.</p>
<p>Just before the twelve-mile point, there was an Indian ahead of me. He turned around and shouted, "Are you an Indian?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then the man he was running with, an American, said, "He is the big boss."</p>
<p>That Indian lives only three houses away from X. She knows him.</p>

<p>I thank God from the bottom of my heart when I see some people's strides. During the California race I was watching the strides of an old man. I said, "God, I should thank You for one thing: that I don't have that kind of stride."</p>
<p>There was one old man whose style I will never forget. His right leg had one kind of position, his left leg another, and his shoulder had a completely different position. O God, how did he run? His entire body was twisted in three different places.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Nice to see you this morning!</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Nice to see you this morning!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning around six-thirty I was walking down the 150th Street hill after running seven miles. At the bottom of the hill there was a big bus stopped at a red light. Behind the bus was a car with two very tall and stout black men in it. The driver had a beard and moustache. When I was about to go back up the hill, the driver got out of the car and took two steps towards me. "How nice to see you this morning!" he said.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to say. So I smiled at him soulfully. Then he went back into his car.</p>

<p>Yesterday at about five-fifteen in the morning I was running near my two-and-a-half-mile point on Union Turnpike. A young man was talking on the phone in a telephone booth as I passed by. All of a sudden he started screaming, "Look, look! Sri Chinmoy is running!" He was so excited. He was telling the person he was talking to on the phone that he was seeing me run by.</p>
<p>I stopped and gave the young man a smile. He was in the seventh heaven of delight. He was tall and clean-shaven, with curly hair, and he had a pack on his back.</p>
<p>These people who greet me in the morning are in some ways my first-class disciples. They get up early in the morning, and they are so happy to see me.</p>

<p>The other day when I was running up the 150th Street Hill, a lady on the street caught me. She stopped me and asked, "Can I speak to you?"</p>
<p>I called Databir and he came running. I told him, "Please talk to her." So Databir talked to her. Later, he said she was crazy. But she didn't seem to me to be crazy. Perhaps she also thought that Databir was crazy.</p>
