<p>The BBC came and interviewed me for a long time at the inauguration ceremony. Then they wanted me to run with the children. So I ran with the children.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end my place was fixed: last. When I started, I had barely covered 100 metres when the children were at 400 metres. They were so fast!</p>
<p>One lady was wheeling her child in a perambulator. She was ahead of me. Then something happened at around 300 metres, and she fell down. I felt miserable!</p>
<p>Afterwards, the father of the girl who had stood first in the competition begged me to be in a photograph with his daughter. She had defeated me badly, so he was very proud of her. The father was the photographer, and he took a very nice picture.</p>

<p>The Mayor came up to me because he wanted to have a picture taken with me in front of one particular statue of the Buddha, which he liked very much.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not care for that statue. So after we had taken the picture that he wanted, I asked him to stand in front of another statue for another picture. According to me, this second statue was infinitely better.</p>
<p>At that time his photographer was missing. We had two photographers of our own, but he wanted to have his own photographer. So we had to wait.</p>
<p>The Mayor was shouting: "Where has he gone! Where has he gone!" Finally, his photographer came and took the picture.</p>

<p>In the two-mile race in London I walked and ran. Even then I defeated Chameli. I said, "Oh, Chameli! Two months ago you gave me a heart attack during our Christmas vacation. At that time, I tried to defeat her, but she went ahead of me.</p>

<p>This morning I went out shopping to buy doughnuts. I had come back from jogging, so I was still wearing shorts. When the lady selling doughnuts saw my shorts, she said, "Good morning, Mr. Summer!"</p>
<p>Then she asked, "Are you Pakistani?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am Indian."</p>
<p>She told me, "Pakistanis always wear shorts."</p>

<p>This morning I went running in shorts and a T-shirt. When the old German lady who lives on my street saw me, she said in broken English, "You don't feel cold?"</p>
<p>I said, "No!"</p>
<p>Then she said, "You want me to feel that I am an old lady!" She was wearing a brown coat.</p>
<p>I told her, "No, you are quite young."</p>
<p>She said, "You have made my day!"</p>
<p>She is the lady who has a dog. She always says something funny to me.</p>

<p>Yesterday when I was running, a little girl called me an idiot. She was in a car. She put her hand out of the window and said, "You are an idiot!"</p>
<p>I said, "Thank you, thank you!"</p>
<p>Her mother, who was driving, felt sorry, She said, "Sorry, sorry, Mr. Sri." Perhaps the little girl saw me as an old man dying of exhaustion, so she was saying, "You are an idiot. Why do you have to run?"</p>

<p>Yesterday I ran our dear friend Cahit Yeter's races. The one-mile race I managed, but in the five-mile race that came next, I suffered so much.</p>
<p>Cahit had given me the number 'one' for my running number. At about a mile and a half into the five-mile race, a little girl was running near me with her father. He said to the child, "Look, number one is running with you."</p>
<p>At the time I was struggling and struggling. The little girl said, "Number one is a lousy runner."</p>
<p>The father said, "Don't say that!"</p>
<p>Then she went ahead of me. We were competing with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, what happened! I went ahead of her towards the finish of the race.</p>
<p>Cahit gave me the number 'one,' so number one got wonderful appreciation from that little girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes Joe Michaels folds his hands when he sees me. But Dan Coffey likes to shake hands with me. He is the happiest of runners, as cheerful as a butterfly.</p>
<p>Dan comes from England, but he acts like an Indian; his soul is all joy. He is like a Heavenly angel. His smile, his movements, everything about him is angelic. Each time you see him, it is like seeing a continuously blossoming flower.</p>
<p>Dan is so nice. How many times he has come up to me to shake hands! Sometimes I am in a serious mood, but his smiling face immediately takes away my seriousness.</p>
<p>Alan Fairbrother is all British. He is measured and very strict and disciplined. But he smiled at me quite a few times; he also is very nice.</p>

<p>I was running near the 700-metre mark in our 1,000-mile race when, quite unexpectedly, a new soul came up to me. The soul was quite unfamiliar, but I did my part. I blessed the soul and then I made a nice promise to the soul about a matter on the outer plane.</p>
<p>Then, when I came to the 800 metre mark, one of the runners ran by me. After going three or four metres ahead, he turned around and gave me the broadest smile. His soul was on his face; so when he turned around, it was his soul that smiled. It was the same soul that I had seen and blessed at the 700-metre mark. His name is Siggy Bauer.</p>
<p>In just thirty or forty seconds from the time I blessed his soul, his soul was able to convince his mind, and that was his response.</p>
<p>The first time he took prasad, he told someone that he felt he was in Heaven.</p>

<p>He told me that we are making history. It is so true; the race is a real victory for America. Where else can they hold this kind of race! And this year it was won by an American.</p>
