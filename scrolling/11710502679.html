  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we know if we are trying to work on too many projects and not getting enough sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we know if we are trying to work on too many projects and not getting enough sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You want to know whether you work too much? There are people who work for an hour and think they have worked for twelve hours. Again, some people work for sixteen hours and feel they have worked only for four hours. According to me, rest is when you take up a new job. In the course of a day, if you are supposed to do six or seven different types of work, each time you change jobs you have to take it as rest. Rest is all in the mind. The mind will say, “I have already finished one thing. How will it be possible for me to enter into another project?” But if you take each job as a golden opportunity to make faster than the fastest progress, and if you can consciously absorb each progress-step that you have made, then you are not fooling yourself by saying that you are enjoying rest.</p>
<p>The same amount of energy, the same level of consciousness you have in one job you will carry with you when you enter into a new job. Imagine that you are climbing up stairs. First comes one step, then the second, then the third. If you use your common sense, after each step you can see that you are getting tired. You will say, “I have to climb up like this twenty flights!” But if you use your heart’s wisdom, you will feel that after each step a fleeting second you are getting before the next step. This is your golden chance. You can say, “Here I am getting rest.”</p>
<p>Work can also be taken in exactly the same way. When you have five or six things to accomplish in a day, at the end of each one think that you are not only getting the opportunity to take rest, but also getting the opportunity to make progress. Left, right, left, right. When the right step is coming, your left leg is taking rest. When the left step is coming, your right leg is taking rest. So each time you change your work, consciously try to feel that you are getting rest. This is not fooling yourself; it is wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How is it that the memory of first seeing you has such capacity to lift our consciousness up very quickly?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How is it that the memory of first seeing you has such capacity to lift our consciousness up very quickly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a very good experience. I have been telling everybody to remember that first experience — the first day you applied. The day you sent your picture or became a disciple, that particular day your life-story became totally different. On that day you made a solemn promise. Your heart, mind, vital, physical existence, everything made a solemn promise to me to be an excellent disciple, and becoming an excellent disciple means to please the Master in his own way.</p>
<p>Then, over the years, the story changes. After three months or six months most disciples come to feel that the Master has to please them fifty per cent and they have to please the Master fifty per cent. They are prepared to meet him half-way. After a few more years the disciples feel that the Master has to come ninety-nine steps, and they will go one step. And then, what is worse, some disciples do not want to take even one step. The Master has to come the full one hundred steps.</p>
<p>So I beg each and every disciple to remember that golden day when he or she accepted the spiritual life, what kind of attitude you had at that time. You wanted one hundred per cent to become an excellent disciple. I am begging you once again to become an excellent disciple, to have constant love for the Master and constant surrender to God’s Will. Each individual started with an excellent attitude. But unfortunately each year a heavy, heavier, heaviest burden of demand and expectation covers your inner wisdom.</p>
<p>To all of you I am saying, just remember the first day you became a disciple. For one week, one month or two months how sincere, how pure, how surrendered you were. Then after five or ten or fifteen or twenty years, what inner demands you began to make. In the beginning, you wanted to establish inner, direct contact with my highest consciousness. Your inner cry like a magnet drew my heart’s love for you and my pride in you. But now there is no disciple who is unconditionally surrendered.</p>
<p>Another thing which applies to all the disciples without exception: if you see that somebody is even one step in front of you, all your inner joy disappears. And if you see that nobody is ahead of you, still you have to look around to make sure there is an audience. Others should see you are the closest. First you see if somebody is ahead of you. If nobody is ahead of you, you feel very, very proud, very happy and pleased with yourself. Then you turn around to see if others are seeing that you are the nearest, you are the dearest. Each and every disciple in that sense has fallen. ‘Fallen’ is an understatement. Previously only you and your Master existed in your life. Now each disciple needs hundreds of witnesses.</p>
<p>I am very happy with your question. That should be the attitude of each and every disciple. Every day you can remember what you first felt in your Master and what you promised to your Master. The day you accepted me was a most significant day in your life. All your simplicity, sincerity, purity, eagerness, willingness, self-giving and other divine qualities you brought to the fore for their complete manifestation. If you can remember this experience, it will be of immense help to you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have been taking driving lessons and I wonder if I am going to pass.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have been taking driving lessons and I wonder if I am going to pass." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not a soothsayer or an occultist. I am an ordinary human being like you. I can pray to God on your behalf, but you will pray to God to help you pass, whereas my prayer will be a little different. I learned it two thousand years ago from somebody. My brother Jesus Christ taught me: “Let Thy Will be done.” I can pray to God that His Will be done in your driving, but what His Will is I cannot tell you.</p>
<p>In Jamaica, West Indies, one ex-disciple failed her driving test at least five times. It was too much, too much! Her husband did not have proper vision, so she had to learn. Every time she failed, she was so miserable. I was miserable too. When the sixth time came, I said to her, “All right, for God’s sake, this time you have to pass.” Luckily, that time she passed.</p>
<p>Whether you pass or fail in your driving, even if you fail one hundred times, I will not feel miserable. I will feel miserable only if your consciousness descends. If you are driving inwardly with aspiration and dedication and that aspiration or dedication descends, then I will feel miserable. Otherwise, when it is a matter of these outer things, you will try your best to pass the examination, but when you are here in front of your Master if you have to think of your driving test, whether you will pass or fail, then it is a waste of time. There are infinitely more important things to do when you are in front of your Master.</p>
<p>The best prayer of all is the one Jesus Christ taught us: “Let Thy Will be done.” Repeat this and you will be the happiest person. Otherwise, you will be happy only if you pass the examination. If you can sincerely pray to God for the fulfilment of His Will, you will see that your happiness will be infinitely, infinitely, infinitely stronger and more fulfilling than when you ask for the fulfilment of your own desire. There is every possibility that He will fulfil your desire, but your aspiring heart will not be pleased.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In one of your poems you say to try to be pleased with yourself all the time. If you feel sad, frustrated or disappointed because a lot of things you didn’t do or you did wrong, then how can you be pleased with yourself?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In one of your poems you say to try to be pleased with yourself all the time. If you feel sad, frustrated or disappointed because a lot of things you didn’t do or you did wrong, then how can you be pleased with yourself?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Even if you have failed ten times, if you have failed in everything that you did during the day, simply be pleased that you did not bring frustration upon yourself. Only take it as an attack. Fortunately, you did not surrender to it. You have to detach yourself from frustration as such. Tomorrow you will make a fresh attempt. But if you cherish frustration or surrender to it, how will you be happy? Let us say you tried this and that and you failed. But if you think of it as failure, complete failure, then tomorrow or the day after, you will not be inspired to again start your journey. Even if you have failed, be satisfied that you did not surrender to failure and you did not invite frustration. Right now you have not succeeded. But since you have not invited frustration, you should be pleased with yourself. It could have been infinitely worse.</p>
<p>Some people enjoy frustration. They invoke it. Then they want to continue with frustration because they feel they are making tremendous progress in this way. Some people have such a negative way of making progress. Unless they are miserable, they think they are not making any progress. As a matter of fact, their mind is tremendously enjoying frustration. It makes them feel very great. In your case, you do not enjoy or invoke frustration. So the following day you can easily make a fresh start.</p>

 <p>
SCA 598-608. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 4 February 1990 at Progress-Promise in New York.</p>
<h2>Question: Yesterday you were talking about the prayer “Let Thy Will be done.” Is it wrong to pray for something specific?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to see what kind of prayer it is. If you pray to God, “God, give me the Light of Compassion,” that prayer is not at all bad. Definitely you have to use your wisdom. If you pray to God for His Compassion, for His Love, for His Blessings, those things are part and parcel of His Will. But if you ask, “Shall I pass in the driving test?” or “Give me a new car,” this kind of thing is totally different.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Lately I’ve read many things about the power of positive thinking.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know if it is something connected with desire. First you will say, “Supreme, give me two hundred dollars.” This most sincere desire you offer to God. Then in your mind you may say, “What will the Supreme think of me? I am supposed to say, ‘Let Thy Will be done’.” When you prayed for two hundred dollars, at that time your desire was so intense, so sincere. But when you said, “Let Thy Will be done,” that prayer became meaningless. It was only by rote that you were saying it. It was all in the mental plane. God knows when you are playing tricks and where your sincerity lies. At that time He will give you zero because He is seeing that when you say “Your Will,” it is just a joke.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it wrong to pray for any desire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it wrong to pray for any desire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you can pray for the fulfilment of your desires, but you have to be very careful because if it is a material desire, then it may fight against your inner aspiration. People pray for new cars. They pray for one house, two houses. You have to see which kind of desire is binding you and which kind of aspiration is liberating you. Some material things are absolutely necessary in our day-to-day lives. Some people who have money-power can easily afford to live decently. But no, they are not satisfied. They have to become multimillionaires. Be rich if you wish, but then you may be poor spiritually. You have to decide which one you want.</p>
<p>Our way is the life of acceptance. You have every right to pray to God for whatever is necessary in your outer life. But you have to see when greed comes, when your desires become exorbitant. How can someone cope with that kind of desire in the spiritual life? You can pray to God to meet the basic necessities of life. At that time I will never say it is the wrong thing to do. But some people only accumulate, accumulate, accumulate. They start accumulating material wealth and become bankrupt in spiritual wealth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If God is not pleased with you, then He may fulfil all your desires so that you can dig your own grave sooner than the soonest. It has happened countless times. When God sees that your case is hopeless, He will fulfil you materially and spiritually give you a larger than the largest zero.</p>
<p>God is like a farmer. He is digging, digging. In one place, He has dug a number of times, but He has not achieved any result. So He goes and ploughs somewhere else. There He is fully satisfied. God gives one person the chance, but that person does not use it properly. He is satisfied to remain in the same situation. How long can God wait for that person? So God says, “Fine. You be happy where you are. I shall plough somewhere else.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My question is regarding manifestation and spirituality. Often, I find that more manifestation means less opportunity to become spiritually stronger.

Often, I find that more manifestation means less opportunity to become spiritually stronger. How does one find the proper balance?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case and in my disciples’ case, manifestation is definitely God’s Will. You are my disciple. So if it is God’s Will for you to manifest His Light, you must never feel that you are doing something wrong. Unfortunately you are separating aspiration from manifestation.</p>
<p>As individuals we have so much eagerness to see our own improvement, to make progress. Now, if we can identify ourselves with others, will we not have the same kind of eagerness for their improvement? We are ready to offer our time, energy and everything for our own aspiration because we want to become perfect. Now God says, “Even though you are not yet perfect, I want you to help your little brother, to bring him up to a certain standard.” You are one step ahead of that person. That is why God is asking you to do it. God is not asking a third person to do the same. God is not asking the other person to come and advise you. God is not asking me to take advice when I go out into the street. But He <em>is</em> telling me, “If you see somebody who is sincere, somebody who is receptive, give him what you have. Give him your energy, give him your light.”</p>
<p>So coming back to aspiration, when you meditate early in the morning, even if you meditate for only fifteen minutes, if you can meditate well, then that meditation-power easily lasts throughout the day. But that meditation has to be very strong. If you fill the tank of your car with gas early in the morning, then you can cover hundreds of miles. Then again, the following day you can refill it. But if there is no gas to start with in the morning, how are you going to cover the distance? In the morning, many, many disciples do not pray or meditate. They are just fooling themselves. For two minutes or three minutes some people will sit in front of the shrine. Then they feel that that is enough.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, at three o’clock or four o’clock, do I tell you to go outside and put up some posters or to go to some television station? First things first. I always say aspiration must come first. Then after your meditation is over, you can go out and do manifestation, which is your dedication. While you are meditating most sincerely, even though you are not thinking of dedication at that time, inwardly God is giving you the energy that you will need in your dedication-life.</p>
<p>It is like morning exercise at home. At home early in the morning you take stretching exercises. Then afterwards you go out to the track and start sprinting. At home you are only stretching. But while you are stretching your legs or doing various postures with your body, God is giving you energy. He is making you ready to enter into the battlefield of life and race against ignorance.</p>
<p>What happens quite often with the disciples is that as soon as they do one thing, they think of the other. When it is time to do dedicated service, they think of aspiration. Then when they are meditating early in the morning, they think of dedication. When it is time to eat, at that time they think of sleeping. And when it is time to sleep, at that time they think of eating. This is what is happening most of the time. When they are doing some dedicated work, they ask themselves why they are not aspiring. They say to themselves, “If I do not meditate, how will it be possible for me to realise God?” And then when they are meditating, after five seconds they think that if they do not go out and do some manifestation, then Guru will not be pleased. All the time, they feel that the other thing is more important. While they are aspiring they think that manifestation is infinitely more important. While manifesting they think that aspiration is infinitely more important. But, according to me, they are equally important.</p>
<p>A long jumper knows that if he steps on the board with his left foot, then he will be able to jump well, but if he steps with the right, he will not be able to jump well at all. How many people can take off with either leg and cover the same distance? One leg is always stronger. Again, the other leg helps while the jumper is coming to the board. At that time he is using both left and right. He is not coming only with the left leg. It is impossible. Here also, in life we have to use both aspiration and dedication. We have to see aspiration inside dedication and dedication inside aspiration. But while we are manifesting, we should not think that aspiration is more important. And while we are praying or meditating, we should not think that manifestation is more important. We will only ruin our aspiration, and we will not do either thing well.</p>
<p>On our path, a minimum of two times daily one should try to meditate for fifteen minutes. Out of fifteen minutes, hardly three minutes people usually meditate well. Nobody can tell me that right from the very start they have raised their consciousness to the highest. It does not happen. I see that it takes time. So out of fifteen minutes, perhaps you can expect at least five minutes of good meditation. Otherwise, no disciple of mine can meditate for fifteen minutes in their highest height.</p>
<p>Coming back to the point, do not neglect your aspiration. First things first. But if you cannot do the first thing, at least do the second thing, which is dedication. They go together. Again, if you cannot do your morning meditation well, at least do your evening meditation well. Of course, the ideal thing will be, when morning dawns, to do your morning meditation extremely well. When it is noon, meditate again. Then in the evening, once more do it. In this way, you will have no problem at all.</p>
<p>You know that eating breakfast is one thing, lunch is something else, and supper is something completely different. We do not eat our dinner at breakfast time. They have to be done one after another. Similarly, if you can meditate three times a day most soulfully — ten minutes in the morning, ten minutes at noon, ten minutes in the evening — then you will be able to value everything. When aspiration is needed, you will be able to give full value to aspiration. When dedication is needed, you will be able to give full value to dedication. After aspiration comes dedication and manifestation. If there is no aspiration, dedication cannot come into existence. So let us aspire early in the morning. Right after our aspiration, God will give us boundless energy and opportunities for dedication. And while we are performing our dedicated service, we will see that it is God’s Divinity within us that is being manifested.</p>
<p>I do not see any conflict between aspiration and dedication, provided they are being done at the time they are needed. Without aspiration how can one climb up the tree? Again, will it be fair if you climb up the tree and sit on the topmost branch, enjoying the fruit to your heart’s content, while at the foot of the tree your dear ones are crying for a mango? Will you be able to devour the mangoes all by yourself? No, your heart will break because your aspiration demands sincerity, concern and compassion. Aspiration is something divine in you that lifts you up. Based on that divine thing, you are on the top of the tree. If something divine lifted you up, and the same divine thing still keeps you up, then will that divine part of you not ask you to come down? It is not your spiritual descent; it is only to offer the fruits to others so they too can eventually be strong enough to climb up the way you have climbed up.</p>
<p>Manifestation is difficult, specially for Indians, because our mind is on aspiration. For Westerners, dedication is comparatively easier because they are accustomed to a dynamic life. Their movement is forward. As Indians, our movement is upward. Whether you go upward or inward or forward, all the movements go together. If you go one inch higher, then at that exact moment you are also going one inch deeper and one inch forward. So these three movements — forward, inward and upward — have to be done simultaneously. If we can really dive deep within, then we can go up like a springboard and also move forward. If we aspire most sincerely, then inside our aspiration will be the movement to dive deep within and to move forward.</p>

I am not asking anybody to swim the English Channel, far from it. Only I am saying if you feel that you have the capacity, try it! You have my blessings. I am certain you will do it. I like these kinds of achievements so much. I do not feel they are something bad. But at the same time, I do not want you to neglect your work at the Centre, and I do not want you to neglect your own aspiration. That I do not approve of.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only see how many years you have wasted. Remember the days when you were energetic and how much joy you got at that time. Each year you participate in the canoe trip for two weeks. How energetic and dynamic you are at that time! So remember the golden days and how much happiness you got. The best way for you to conquer lethargy is to remember the experiences when you worked very hard for the canoe trip. When you bring to the fore the memory of that energetic life, you will get such joy. That joy is progress, and it will help you to do other things with the same kind of enthusiasm and eagerness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know that what you are doing is the right thing, you will do it, in spite of the fact that you have failed ten times. If you are doing the right thing, then you can do it even two hundred times without achieving success. When I was trying to lift 300 pounds, I knew I was doing the right thing. After two hundred failures, did I give up? No, I continued, and eventually I succeeded on my 214th attempt. If I know that I am doing something that is definitely right, even if I am not succeeding, if it is God’s Will that I do something, I will do it.</p>

Should those certain things not be done?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are in the competitive world with your brother and sister disciples, my advice is to establish more oneness. Otherwise, if you increase your tendency to compete with others, it will end in destruction. By hook or by crook you will try to defeat your colleagues, your friends, or our other spiritual Centres. So this competitive attitude has to be nipped in the bud. Definitely compete with yourself. That is essential. If you were angry with someone yesterday because they did something wrong, then today try to forgive them. See how much you can identify yourself with their weaknesses. That kind of competition is for your self-improvement. Examine how much tolerance you had yesterday and today see if you have increased your tolerance. Then you will see your progress. But if you say that you are right and somebody else is wrong, then you are only exercising your supremacy. This kind of competition with others is destruction.</p>
<p>Of course, in a race you are running on the same track with other runners. Here, although you are competing, you are not trying to defeat those other runners by hook or by crook. No, your goal is to see if you are running well. You will run together because sometimes there is joy when people are doing the same thing. If you are competing with others, you have to remember that you are not competing with the person who is beside you or with those who are in front of you or behind you. You are only competing with yourself. Otherwise wrong ideas will come into your mind. Your attitude will be to defeat that person by hook or by crook. Then it is your destruction. But if you are only competing with others in order to run the fastest, to do your best, then whatever result comes, you will be happy.</p>
