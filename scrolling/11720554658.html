  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can I feel more compassion from the picture of the Divine Mother Kali?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can I feel more compassion from the picture of the Divine Mother Kali?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are identifying yourself with the Mother Kali that you are seeing on the gross vital plane. Here she is killing the asuras, the undivine forces that are standing against the divine manifestation. Within and without it is all destruction. She is destroying the unlit, impure human, or let us say animal emotions and propensities.</p>
<p>But you have to know that this Mother Kali has her Source. Her Source is <em>sat-chit-ananda:</em> Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. There she is all golden. If we identify our inner or spiritual existence, our inner cry with her reality, then we shall see that she is all compassion. She is taking our side against those who are obstructing our progress. She is fighting for the divine soldiers who would like to become totally dedicated, totally surrendered to God's Will.</p>
<p>When a human being conquers someone, he conquers only to show his supremacy. But when the divine forces conquer the undivine forces, they do so with the view of transforming the undivine qualities of those asuric forces. When Julius Caesar conquered, he immediately said, "<em>Veni, vidi, vici</em>;" "I came, I saw, I conquered." But when a spiritual Master conquers someone, he says, "I love you. I have become what you are. Now let me use you the way I want to use you so that you can make the fastest progress." This is the difference between Julius Caesar and a spiritual Master.</p>
<p>In your case you have to know that you are having difficulty finding Compassion in Mother Kali because you are seeing her outer face, outer arms, outer movement. There you see her destructive or, you may even go to the length of saying, ferocious capacity. But just go deep within and you will see that she is the Mother of Compassion. In a fleeting moment she can take us to the highest plane of consciousness. She is the Mother of Power and she is Mother of Compassion both. Mahakali is the Mother of height and speed, tremendous speed. If other cosmic gods grant you something, it may take ten years for you to get it. But if you can satisfy Mother Kali, you can get it in a day. She has that capacity. She is the fastest in giving. But in return, naturally she will demand from us more purity, a more consecrated life. If she is granting us a boon in such a fast way, she has every right to expect this from us.</p>
<p>So in order to see Mother Kali's compassion-aspect, you have to identify yourself with her inner existence, not with her outer existence which is depicted by the imagination of some artist. When the soldier is on the battlefield, you see in him a kind of quality or capacity which is not noticeable when he is with the sweet members of his family. When he is in the battlefield, he is a totally different person. There he has to be very brave, very powerful; otherwise ignorance will devour him. So here the Mother Kali is fighting against the ignorance-forces in order to conquer them and transform them eventually. It is for their good, plus it is for the manifestation of God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can I be more compassionate to others, especially those not on the spiritual path?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can I be more compassionate to others, especially those not on the spiritual path?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of yourself as a member of a family. When you were seven or eight years old, you made many mistakes. You committed even Himalayan blunders, let us say. But your elder brother forgave you, your father or your mother forgave you, because you were a child. Your elder brother was older than you in terms of years and your parents were older than you, so they forgave you. Automatically compassion descends when you feel that somebody is a child and does not know better.</p>
<p>People who have not consciously launched into the spiritual life deserve your special compassion because they are like little brothers. An unconscious, unaspiring person — a little brother — is someone who does not know how to walk along the path. He just stumbles. So the elder brothers in the family just go and pick him up.</p>
<p>Unaspiring people deserve our compassion. But this compassion is not pity. There is a great difference between compassion and pity. When we show compassion, at that time our whole heart becomes one with the suffering of others. If somebody is poverty-stricken and we offer our compassion, we become one with his poverty itself. But when we show pity to someone, we feel he is inferior to us and we maintain our own height. We remain on the Himalayan height and the person to whom we are showing pity is at the bottom of a chasm. We stand millions of miles away or thousands of miles higher than the reality of the other person. But in compassion we just come to him and become one. When God shows us His Compassion, He just becomes one with our deplorable reality.</p>
<p>So you can show compassion to these people only by becoming one with them. Feel that they are your little brothers. Today they do not know, but tomorrow they are going to learn. Once upon a time you were a little child; now you are in a position to run, not to speak of walking or marching. Similarly, these children will also start walking, then marching, then running, running the fastest towards their goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we suffer unpleasant experiences and make mistakes, does that mean that the Supreme has withdrawn His Grace?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we suffer unpleasant experiences and make mistakes, does that mean that the Supreme has withdrawn His Grace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, that is not true. It is just that ignorance-forces are there. A child goes and puts his finger in the fire. That doesn't mean that the mother has less concern for the child. The mother has tremendous concern. But the mother is upstairs and the child has gone into the kitchen and placed his finger in the fire. Does that mean that the mother has no concern for the child? No. But the child is still ignorant. He does not know the power of fire.</p>
<p>When we do something wrong, at times it is because we do not know, and at times it is because we are tempted to do the thing. Sometimes the child knows that the fire will burn his finger, but he gets a kind of malicious pleasure in touching fire. With us also, in spite of knowing better, sometimes we enter into ignorance. It is like eating food. We know there is something called a sufficient quantity, but we overeat. We eat voraciously, and then we pay the penalty. But when we become, consciously or unconsciously, a victim to temptation, we can't say that God's Grace has withdrawn from our lives. Far from it! The only thing is that we are deliberately entering into ignorance. The mother can prevent the child from touching fire. She can say, "Don't do it, don't do it." But the difficulty is that if the determination does not come from within, no matter how many times the divine forces try to prevent us from doing the wrong thing, we will feel a sense of loss. We will feel that we have missed something.</p>
<p>From within we have to feel that we are not losing anything by not entering into ignorance; or we have to feel that it is only a temporary necessity for us to make mistakes, because of our ignorance. If we live in light, there is no necessity to make mistakes. It is not because the divine Grace has been withdrawn that we become victims to ignorance. Far from it. But what can the divine Grace do? Limited freedom God has given us. To everybody He has given it. This limited freedom is like a knife. Somebody will use the knife to cut a mango and share it with others, and somebody else will use the knife to stab another person. We are suffering not because God has withdrawn. God has given us the capacity; so now let us use it wisely with our discretion and wisdom.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can bring down the Compassion of the Supreme into your being so that you can make faster progress just by crying like a child. When a child cries helplessly, he feels that his mother is in a position to fulfil his need. He cries most helplessly just because he knows and feels that his mother is there to fulfil his need. As a seeker you will cry soulfully, not helplessly. If you cry helplessly, you may at times fall victim to despondency; whereas if you cry soulfully, from deep within, then your cry is bound to be heard by the Supreme Mother, the Supreme within you. And then you will make the fastest progress in your spiritual life. The moment your cry is heard, rest assured that your progress becomes infinitely faster.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Justice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Justice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What does God's Justice do when jealousy and impurity are brought before the Supreme's Court?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Justice is not human justice; it is not punishment. God only says, "I have given you chances time and again, but you have not properly used the golden Hour. Again, I am ready to give chances endlessly." God at that time deals with His infinite Patience. First He deals with Light, He tries to illumine our jealousy and impurity and transform them into a feeling of oneness and purity. But if the seeker does not want that, if he does not want his jealousy or impurity to be illumined, then God uses another weapon: His Patience-weapon. The first weapon he uses is His Wisdom-weapon. Patience also is a form of wisdom, and wisdom is patience, but we separate them.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a selfish person. God says, "The moment you forget about your personal, selfish, self-seeking life and care only for self-giving, then your jealousy will go away. The moment you pay attention only to purity, then impurity will leave you." First this wisdom God will try to shower on you. But if you do not avail yourself of this opportunity to receive God's Grace or Wisdom, then God will use another weapon which is called patience. He will wait until you feel the necessity of purification and transformation of your nature. Then, after ten years or twenty years or fifty years, again He will try to inspire you. At that time, if He succeeds, well and good. Otherwise, there will be another time. In this way continuously He will go on, go on, go on. In the course of time, the seeker will fulfil the demands of his inner being and God's Promise to His own Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is force excluded in Justice?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is force excluded in Justice?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme uses force, but it is not human force. Beating or striking someone, showing supremacy or authority: this is the human force. But the Supreme's Force operates in a different way. His Force is the intensity of necessity. Suppose the seeker is not intense in his aspiration. The Supreme will make him intense. This intensity you can call a force, but it is not thrust upon him. Somebody is lethargic. He wants to go slowly, at the speed of an Indian bullock cart. But God says, "Now I have invented the jet plane. Why have you to use an Indian bullock cart?" So God will use His intensity-power. This intensity we may misunderstand. We may think that God is forcing us, that He is compelling us to go. No, He is just awakening us. He just says, "Look, open your eyes. Here is the fastest speed." When He awakens our consciousness, we feel that it has been done by pressure. But if we are sincere and devoted and surrendered, we don't feel any kind of pressure; only we feel that the time has come. God has selected a choice Hour and He has awakened us.</p>
<p>Human force is a vital force. In vital force there is a compulsion. The force is coming to frighten us, to threaten us. But when there is force in divine Justice, it does not frighten or threaten us. Only it increases the immensity or the intensity of our aspiration so that, like a bullet, we run towards the goal. When God uses force, God will ask us to run towards the goal at the pace that He has set, not at our pace. If we don't identify ourselves with God's Will, then it really becomes a kind of pressure, a force. But if we become one with Him, then it is not a pressure, it is not a force.</p>
<p>We are right now in the body, let us say. Our superior, most illumined part, the head, has discovered some truth, but the feet have not yet discovered the truth. The head is telling the feet, "Look, this is the reality." If the feet do not identify themselves with the head, then they say, "Don't bother us. We don't need you. We don't need your realisation." But if the feet also feel the necessity of wisdom, then they will be so grateful that the head has helped them to know the reality.</p>
<p>I am now talking here, offering light. I am trying to convince you of something. To convince someone is a way of exercising one's authoritative force. But when it is a divine way of operation, we don't convince; we just illumine. The part that is still unillumined, we try to illumine. Then there is no force at all. The illumined part is just making the unillumined part aware of our own higher existence. If the lower existence feels that there is a higher existence which is part and parcel of its own reality, then naturally the lower will fly into the higher and become one with the higher.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is your view of the part of the Bible that says we should fear God&#039;s Justice?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is your view of the part of the Bible that says we should fear God&#039;s Justice?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to forgive me, but I cannot subscribe to that view. We must not fear God's Justice and we must not fear God. If we fear God, we will never be able to reach God, we will never be able to get anything from God. If a child is afraid of his father, he will not be able to receive anything from his father. He will not even go to his father. If he sees that his father is so tall and robust and powerful, then he will not go to him. But if the child loves the father, even though the father has power and strength, the child feels that the father is not going to use it to strike him. On the contrary, the child feels that the father will use that power to protect him if he is in danger. The child feels that his father's power is all for him. And he will be able to brag that he is so great, so powerful, because of his father's strength. A child does not have even a dollar, but if he knows that his father has thousands of dollars, he goes and tells his friends, "Look, I am so rich; my father has so much money." How he identifies with his father's wealth!</p>
<p>Only through love do we become one. The moment we are afraid of someone, his reality and our reality become separate. I am your spiritual leader, but how am I going to give anything to you if you are afraid that it will just burn you? Reverential awe is one thing; fear is something else. In reverential awe you feel that someone is a little higher than you, so you have to behave well. God is infinitely better than you in every way, so you feel that you must have that kind of reverence. But deeper than reverence is love, true love. A child does not need reverence; he does not have to show reverence because he knows he has love, which is infinitely more effective. A child does not have to go and touch his father's feet every second. No. The moment he shows his father his love, his heart, that is enough.</p>
<p>To approach God with fear or through fear is very unhealthy. We only love God. We feel that what our Father has, we also have. Unfortunately, we are still children; that is why our Father is unable to give it to us. The father does not give his vast wealth to a child. But when the child grows up, he gets what his father has and what his father is. If we can love God soulfully, then God will give us everything.</p>
<p>When a child is playing in the mud and then all of a sudden he is called, he is not afraid that his mother will beat him because he is dirty. He will go running to his mother and his mother will immediately take his dirt, his filth, as her very own. She will wash him in order to show others that her son is also very clean. We have to take God like that. No matter how many undivine things we do, we run towards Him and feel that with His Compassion He will just clean us immediately.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you forgive injustice?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you forgive injustice?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we think of injustice in human terms, we have to go to the very depth of our realisation. When we came into the world we made a solemn promise to God that we would realise God, manifest God and fulfil God here on earth. This was our most sincere, most soulful promise to God. When we made that promise we were in the soul's world. We didn't have the physical body; our real existence was the soul. At that time the soul said, "I am descending into the world only to please You, to fulfil You, to manifest You unconditionally." But now, the word 'unconditionally' immediately frightens us. It is a poisonous word; we can't use it. All is conditional, conditional.</p>
<p>These people whom you feel are very unjust have done something undivine, true. But look at your own promise. You expect from these people perfection; you feel they have to do everything in a perfect way. But perfection comes only when we fulfil our promise. Our first and foremost promise was to God, to please Him and fulfil Him on earth. We have not fulfilled <em>our</em> promise; yet we expect others to fulfil <em>their</em> promise. As spiritual people, we should always see what we have done wrong. Millions of things we have done wrong. If we do millions of things wrong, then naturally God is forgiving us. Otherwise, we would not be able to exist on earth. If He is ready to forgive us in spite of our countless defects and mistakes, how is it that we cannot forgive someone else?</p>
<p>A spiritual seeker immediately claims himself to be a chosen child of God. An unaspiring person, a person who is wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, would never dare to claim this. He does not dare to claim God as his very own. But you do dare to claim that you are God's chosen child, just because you have got an iota of God's good qualities. God is good, God is divine, God is perfect, and all His divine qualities you have to some extent. So if one of God's qualities is forgiveness, and if God forgives you twenty-four hours a day, can't you forgive a person for one second? If your source has the capacity to do something in infinite measure, naturally you also should have the capacity to forgive or illumine others who have done something wrong, according to your standard.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When somebody performs an act of injustice, does the soul of the victim always learn something from the experience?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When somebody performs an act of injustice, does the soul of the victim always learn something from the experience?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this case you have to know that the real soul is not getting any kind of experience. If someone gives you a slap unnecessarily, your soul is not getting an experience. The outer being is getting an experience. The soul is dealing with your whole realisation, outer revelation and divine manifestation. The soul has all experiences that are encouraging, inspiring, illumining and fulfilling. But sometimes the outer being also needs experience. When your outer being gets an unpleasant experience, then it will be more cautious. "Why did somebody give me a slap? What have I done?" If you have done nothing then immediately you will feel, "I have to be more cautious. It was not because I did something that I am being struck. No, it is because of the ignorance of the world. Whether I have done something wrong is immaterial. Just because the world is full of ignorance, the world's ignorance may enter into me. So I have to be more careful."</p>
<p>Sometimes when we do something wrong, we are afraid that somebody will come and take us to task and we will have to pay the penalty. But there are many, many wrong forces around us that attack us even if we do nothing wrong. These hostile forces, undivine forces, are moving around. But the real experience belongs to our outer being, which is trying to perfect itself. The soul gets the experience to some extent, but the real experience belongs to the outer being. The soul is dealing with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality; it has a very big task to do. It is not that the soul is ignoring the outer being. The only thing is that the outer being also has to undergo some changes through these experiences.</p>
