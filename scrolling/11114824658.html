<p>Before the Westchester Half-Marathon we met with the excellent runner Gary Fanelli, and the singers sang the song that I had dedicated to him. In the song I had mentioned his deer-speed. He thanked me and said that quite often he thinks about a deer while he is running. He said, "It is a very beautiful song. I love you all very much. I hope you all have a good race today."</p>
<p>I told him, "You should come first, as you did last year. You show your deer-speed!"</p>
<p>"After this song I am charged, plugged in," he said.</p>
<p>Then I gave him a copy of the song and I returned the pictures of his two daughters, Laura and Celeste, that he had given me. He saw that I had written "Blessings and Love" on their foreheads. He said, "Nothing means more than your blessings in my life."</p>
<p>I am so happy that he won the half-marathon. Many years ago he had been interested in following our path when he was living in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>During the Westchester Half-Marathon I walked eight or nine times. Shame! Sometimes when I was running, people who were walking were going faster than I was. Since they were walking faster than my running speed, I said, "The best thing is to walk."</p>
<p>Then Cahit Yeter came back after he had finished and ran the last mile and a half of the race with me.</p>

<p>Today Agraha's sister, Cathy, saw me while I was running down the 150th Street hill. She folded her hands in a very obvious way. Then when I came back up the hill, she still had her hands folded. These things only happen when I run after six o'clock in the morning. When I run at four or five o'clock, I never see any disciples.</p>
<p>The other morning at five o'clock, when I was running up 150th Street, Michael Berens started yelling from his window, "Good morning!" Since he lives in Sal's house, he could see me from his room. He was yelling, "Good morning, Guru!" out the window, but I was tired and I didn't have the strength to tell him, "Good morning!"</p>

<p>I got a new name today. While I was running a middle-aged man was driving by in a small van. He was calling out, "Mr. Hill, Mr. Hill!" and looking at me. It seems that everybody has heard of our race on 150th Street, fifty times up and down the hill.</p>

<p>This morning, a little before four o'clock, I went on my first run for the day. The second time I ran it was around five o'clock. At that time two people saw me as I was running up the 150th Street hill. They started making fun of me. They said, "Now it is your turn to enjoy yourself. Before your 'deesciples' died, and you watched. Now you are enjoying the hill." They were referring to our 150th Street races.</p>
<p>So I said, "Yes, now I am enjoying it. You come every morning at five o'clock to enjoy running with me. You people come!"</p>
<p>They were very surprised. They had thought that I would remain like the silent Brahma and wouldn't talk to them. I was on my fifth mile of hill work and I was dying. I was panting and making noise and they were mocking me.</p>
<p>After running five miles, I walked two miles up and down the hill. So I did seven miles of hill work. It is a little different when you run alone with nobody to cheer for you.</p>

<p>Usually I go out running for the third time at about quarter to seven each morning. Starting at four or five o'clock, every hour I go and run. Many times at quarter to seven I see Harry's son, Bruce, who is so nice to us when we use P.S. 86 for functions. Bruce has a small van. Quite often when he drives by he says, "Guru, Guru! Hello, Guru!"</p>
<p>The bus drivers also are very nice to me. I can be on the other side of the street, but still they will honk and wave. Often I go out to run, so now they recognise me.</p>

<p>During the five-mile race today a gentleman was ahead of me. All of a sudden he stopped and turned around and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?" I was panting and no words were coming out of me. So I gave him a smile.</p>
<p>He said, "You are Sri Chinmoy!" and he made a cross sign on his forehead — not on his chest. He was very happy to see me. Then he ran with me for about two hundred metres. But he felt that he was a better runner so he went ahead of me. I was just behind him.</p>

<p>At the two-mile point two women were running near me. When I was passing by, one of them was so excited to see me. She said to the other one, "Do you know who that is?"</p>
<p>The other one said, "Who?"</p>
<p>O God, the first woman who saw me answer because I was coming very near them and she didn't want me to hear. Perhaps she was afraid of the pronunciation, afraid that she would be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Then, when I was about five metres ahead of them, the lady said, "Sri Chinmoy." But when I was running next to them, she wouldn't tell her friend who I was.</p>

<p>Mitali completed our five-mile race today. For Mitali to complete five miles is really something! Her better half, Boiragi, was so happy that she had finished. I also was so delighted! I was clapping and clapping. On other days when I smile at her, she smiles, but today she was dying, so she could not smile at the finish.</p>
<p>Mitali was my first competitor when I started running and the second was Nemi. Like that I competed with about ten girls. Pranavananda's assistant, Susan, gave me a very hard time. I ran and ran trying to pass her. At one point she went to drink water and I was very happy that she had stopped. I didn't go to take a drink. O God, after drinking water, she got extra energy! So my intuition was totally wrong. I didn't even dare to think of defeating her after that. But after covering a few hundred metres, she finally slowed down. Then, with Kritagyata, I had to struggle for at least four hundred metres to pass her.</p>
<p>After four miles I thought that all the worthless runners were behind me, so I didn't have to worry. My ego was quite satisfied. Then all of a sudden I saw Sarama. I couldn't lose to Sarama, so I was praying to my ego to come forward. Then my ego listened to my prayer and I defeated Sarama. It is a great achievement to beat Sarama. I didn't know she was so far ahead of me, but I passed her at the four-mile mark.</p>
<p>After four hundred metres, whom did I see? Ilona! She was making noises: "Eee, Eee!' I said to myself, "Wait, wait." Then during the fifth mile I ran so fast that I went two or three hundred metres ahead of her. She was nowhere near me at the finish.</p>

<p>Last night in Puerto Rico, Kamalakanta and I were running in the heavy rain. The streets were in very bad condition, and we passed two or three bars where the people were very undivine. But the rain gave us extra energy. Even though I hadn't eaten in days, we walked and ran over four miles. So if you don't eat, perhaps you get extra energy.</p>

<p>This morning in Puerto Rico I ran randomly. When I run randomly, God knows where I go. My aim was to run for one hour. Nowadays I only care for the time, not the miles. So I ran by Shubhra's house. In thirty-five minutes I was there. O God, suddenly a police car came up quite fast and stopped abruptly. Two policemen came out of the car. They slammed the doors and entered into a small house nearby. A lady and her husband were in a panic about something. Something had happened. In ten minutes' time I followed the same route home. I said to myself, "Let me see what is happening." But there was no police car. There was absolutely nobody around.</p>
