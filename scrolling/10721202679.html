<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Saraswati, according to our Indian philosophy, is the mother of art, the mother of music, the mother of knowledge. She plays on the vina and when she plays, she illumines the aspiring consciousness of humanity. She is the supreme artist, and when her Compassion flows in and through an individual, if that particular individual is receiving her Compassion-Light, then he becomes a supreme artist.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen or fifteen years old, Saraswati came to me once and played on her vina most soulfully. Then afterwards she broke her vina into pieces and gave the pieces to me. She said that she had taken all her knowledge and all her musical capacities and other capacities and thrown them into me, but only as much as I was able to receive. So of wisdom perhaps I received a little.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, an artist can do it very beautifully. Very recently when I was in Iceland, I met an artist who was also a very successful medium, though in spirituality she still needed tremendous progress. I showed her and her group how to concentrate, meditate and contemplate. And while I was doing this, she actually saw my golden aura and my blue aura. She was sitting right in front of me, and while she was there, she drew a picture of my aura. Spiritually she is not very developed yet, but as an artist I must say she drew my aura very successfully.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When someone feels a beautiful poem inside, what prevents its outer expression?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When someone feels a beautiful poem inside, what prevents its outer expression?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two main reasons. The first reason is that when you feel a poem, you doubt it; you doubt whether it is real or not. You feel, “Oh, how can I have that kind of beautiful feeling? Five minutes ago I told a lie, ten minutes ago I was jealous of somebody, so it is impossible to feel this way now.” But what happened five minutes ago has nothing to do with what you are feeling right now. The mind is so clever. When you have a wonderful experience, a very good, high experience, your mind will immediately try to throw cold water on it, because your mind does not want you to have joy in its pure form. Your mind will immediately ask you how you can experience this kind of thing when you acted so undivinely just a little while ago. The mind will say it is all a mental hallucination. And the moment you give up the experience, the same mind will come and say, “See, you are such a fool! You have lost everything; you have thrown away everything. God alone knows how many months it will take you to get this experience back again.”</p>
<p>The second reason why you cannot express a poem that you have inside you is that there is a gap between your feeling and your becoming. When you feel something, if you do not immediately become that thing, then your vital being revolts. The vital being feels that you have allowed a stranger to enter into you, and it becomes jealous. It acts just like a child when he sees that his mother and father have allowed somebody else to come and stay at his house. Naturally he becomes jealous because he feels that now his parents won’t be able to pay as much attention to him as before. When you feel something inside you, it means that you have invited someone or something to your house, but he has not yet entered. Once he enters, the expression is as good as achieved, but before he enters the child may revolt. He may start crying and say, “I don’t want him; I don’t want him.” But if the parents become serious and say, “I have invited him and he will definitely stay,” then it is all over. Once you become what you feel, the difficulty is over. These are the two main things that keep you from manifesting in your outer life what you feel within yourself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the kind of art. If it is spiritual art, then certainly it is a form of meditation. But if you play undivine music or write unbearable books or keep your mind in the gutter while you are painting, this is not any kind of meditation. While you are creating, if your consciousness is in the lower vital world, it will not be a form of meditation. But if you are singing something soulful or if you are in a very high consciousness while you are creating, if you are giving yourself in a divine way to the object or subject that you are involved with, then definitely you are doing a form of meditation. You have to know what you are creating, and where your consciousness is while you are doing it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is art from the Renaissance period more inspired than modern art?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is art from the Renaissance period more inspired than modern art?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In those days, art was more soulful and more meaningful than present-day art. I can make neither head nor tail of what many of the modern artists do. They will say that I am an ignorant fellow and what do I know about art. But I will simply say, “Yes, I am an ignorant fellow, true. But when a work of art by Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo is placed before me and when your painting is placed before me, why am I attracted and inspired by their art and not by yours? It is the same person who is judging: I have the same eyes, the same heart, the same inner qualities and the same lack of knowledge. I am not saying that all modern artists are bad artists. Far from it. There are some exceptional modern artists. But, in general, modern artists are not as inspiring or elevating as the artists of the Renaissance period. That era was far more progressive, spiritual and soul-elevating than the present in the field of creative art.</p>
<p>A few months ago I drew a series of drawings in which nobody could see anything. But I gave bombastic names to them in order to prove that they were all spiritual! Most of the modern artists do the same. What they paint, God alone knows. But when you ask them what they see in their art, it is absolutely all revelation and manifestation, all cosmic vision. But when Leonardo da Vinci painted Mona Lisa’s consciousness, he captured it all most vividly — Eternity’s Pride. You look at Mona Lisa and you see that she is divinity’s Light and Immortality’s Life.</p>
<p>If somebody is very ugly, he tries to put on most expensive, most beautiful garments. But if he is really ugly, that does not help. Modern artists are only dealing with colour, line and sound, but there is no soul behind it. How long can you appreciate the body and form if the spirit is lacking? Modern artists may paint a person’s body, his body-consciousness, but there is no spirit there. They may write music, but there is no divine harmony in it, generally. That is why modern art does not succeed in terms of spirituality. Many people may enjoy it, but it will not inspire them or elevate their consciousness at all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual significance of Tantric art is the significance of life-energy, life-energy moving upward, downward, inward and outward. Wherever it gets a free passage, life-energy is flowing, so that it can become one with the universal Consciousness. Wherever there is no obstruction, there new life is being manifested.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unaspiring art and music will definitely lower our consciousness. All seekers, but especially beginners, must avoid unaspiring people and things because there is every possibility of their falling. Because we are seekers, we are trying all the time to keep our consciousness high, to elevate our consciousness. But if our consciousness is one inch higher than somebody else’s, there is every possibility that that person will either pull us down or that we ourselves will be tempted to go down. For ordinary people there is no real harm in it. If somebody is already in the lowest, he cannot go any farther down. But if we have begun to ascend, we can also descend quite comfortably.</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together. Unaspiring music and unaspiring musicians go together, unaspiring artists and unaspiring art go together, and unaspiring people are the observers. When bad people do something there are always bad people available to appreciate it, and when good people do something there are also people to appreciate and admire it. Again, if someone is very powerful spiritually, he can pull unaspiring people up higher. But also, if someone is very powerful in a negative way, he can pull weak aspirants down.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the soul an artist?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the soul an artist?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! The soul itself is an artist, and its capacity is boundless. The soul is the eldest brother who will give lessons to the younger brother as he paints. Then the soul will say to the younger brother, the body, “Let us work together; let us show our art together.” People will come to see the art of a great, well-known artist, but if an aspiring artist is unknown, nobody will come to see his work. However, if the insignificant one wants to learn from the advanced one, then the capacity of the advanced one enters into the other. In this way, the soul’s capacity enters into the body. It is like the ocean entering into a drop. The Infinite enters into the finite and the finite enters into the infinite, it is like having one dollar and one penny. When they become one, you have a hundred and one cents, and you offer it all together at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme is responsible for everything; only we have to know that He has given us limited freedom. The parents have created the child, but they do not control his every breath. They have given him, say, just a dollar and they watch what he does with it. They observe whether he uses that dollar to buy a spiritual book, or whether he uses it to buy something undivine. Similarly, the Supreme gives you limited freedom and then watches what you do with it. This is how He plays. If He sees that you are using that freedom divinely, then He will give you much more freedom. But if you misuse it, then you have to suffer the consequences. How can you blame poor God?</p>
<p>But even if you use your freedom in a good way, you do not get full satisfaction until you have used your freedom to become one with the Supreme. Then the Supreme will always be consciously acting in and through you. He is like the father who says, “You want to be happy in your own way. I will give you the opportunity. But since you always want to maintain your individuality, why do I have to guide you and protect you all the time? All right, use your individuality, but use it in a good way.” When He gives you capacity and opportunity, if you misuse it and make a mess out of your life, how can you blame God? The best thing to do is to let the Supreme act in and through your freedom. Only when you allow the Supreme to act in and through you, will the world become perfect.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are artistic capacity and the ability to manifest it the same?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are artistic capacity and the ability to manifest it the same?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a difference between the capacity to create and the capacity to manifest. Again, if God’s Grace descends, the capacity to create and the capacity to manifest become one. At that time, the capacity to manifest becomes an extension of the capacity to create. Suppose you get your Master’s degree. When you get your Master’s degree, immediately people expect you to be able to teach others. But in spite of having your Master’s degree, let us say that you can’t teach at all. The capacity to go high you have, but the capacity to manifest your height you don’t have. But when some people get their degree in a specific subject, they do have the capacity to teach others. In them the capacity to create and the capacity to manifest go together.</p>
<p>Let us say that even after getting your degree, still you want to learn. Even though you lack the capacity to teach, still you want to go higher. Even after you get your Ph.D., you go to the library and read hundreds of books. There is no end to your learning; since you are not stopping at a particular limit, your very movement will develop into some capacity to manifest. It is like a river that does not come to an end. While it is flowing, flowing, flowing, it is spreading water this side and that side; it is manifesting its consciousness. If it is a pond, then everything has stopped. If it is a pool, its movement has stopped. But when it becomes a river, it is continuously flowing and manifesting. So the capacity to create can eventually grow into a capacity to manifest if one continuously creates and creates. Even if one does not have the capacity to manifest right from the very beginning, it is quite possible to develop that capacity.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters who have realised God do not want to help mankind. They are frightened to death to mix with earthly people. They say, “Earthly people are worse than animals. If we mix with them, then all their animal qualities will enter into us. With greatest difficulty we have come out of the animal kingdom, so why mix with them?” But again, some Masters say, “No! We are stronger than animals and it is quite possible for us to mix with them and tame them and transform them.” And some, out of compassion, say, “Once upon a time we were also like them. Just because we have come out of the animal kingdom by spiritual practice, shall we leave our younger brothers in the lurch? No, we shall try to help them. If by chance we are caught by ignorance while helping our brothers and sisters, no harm. After all, if the elder brother is ready to give his life to save a younger brother, God will be really pleased with him and God will say, ‘All right, since you have tried to save your younger brother, I will give you a new life.’”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can enter into the art of Immortality only through your constant aspiration. When you meditate, always you have to feel that which is infinite is immortal, and that which is finite is mortal. Anything that far surpasses and transcends your earthly vision can be the object of your meditation. If you want to meditate, meditate on something vast. Look at the sky and meditate and the vastness of the sky will enter into you. Or meditate on the vast ocean and the consciousness of the ocean will enter into you. Anything that is vast is immortal. The vast consciousness of the sky and the vast consciousness of the ocean are immortal. The finite binds, but the infinite always expands itself. The thing that binds can never be immortal, but the thing that expands and liberates is immortal. So please meditate only on things that are vast.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I meditate on the Supreme in art?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I meditate on the Supreme in art?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please do not separate the Supreme from art. Water and ice are inseparable; similarly, the Supreme and art are inseparable. When you meditate on art, feel that there is somebody inside the art who is the life-breath of the art. Feel that the art is the body, and that inside the body is the soul. If the soul goes away, the body is lifeless. Again, if there is a soul without a body, then there is no place for the soul to stay. It cannot stay in the street. A man without a house is homeless, and a house without a man is useless. House and man need each other to complete the game, as do body and soul. In the same way, art and the supreme Artist also go together to complete the game.</p>
<p>If you see art, try to see the Artist inside it. You will do this only by taking them as one. When you see art, you will feel that inside the art there is something which you need badly, and that is the Supreme. The Supreme is both art and artist, both creator and creation. When you realise this, you can easily meditate on the Supreme in art.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it necessary for a seeker to appreciate different forms of art?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it necessary for a seeker to appreciate different forms of art?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only if the seeker wants to. If the seeker does not have any appreciation for art, this will not stand in his way. If somebody does not have the capacity to appreciate art, his spiritual progress will not be delayed. Many spiritual Masters did not know even the ABC’s of art; they did not know about it and they did not care about it, but their realisation was in no way delayed. If you have the capacity to appreciate art, do it, and if you don’t have the capacity, no harm. Your God-realisation depends entirely upon your aspiration.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can appreciate something good in others, it is a help to you. If somebody has achieved something great in the art world, and if you have the capacity to appreciate it, then it becomes easier for you to realise the Highest, because in art also there is God. If you lack the capacity to appreciate art, or if you have a personal prejudice against a certain form of art, then don’t bother with it. Only remain with your own aspiration, because your own aspiration will give you realisation. But if you don’t feel jealousy toward the artist, if you don’t have a personal prejudice against the artist or his art, and if you have the capacity to appreciate the art, then your progress becomes complete and integral.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you pray and meditate, please feel that the love that you have is not to possess or to bind anyone. The love that you have is only for expansion, only for the illumination of others. When you want to give someone your divine love, it means that you want to see that person as you see yourself: you want to see him as an exact replica of your own life. You give so that you will see him as an extension of yourself. When you meditate, you have to tell the Supreme that what He has given you, that very thing you want to share with your brothers. You can share with those around you; it is not only possible, but it is inevitable.</p>
