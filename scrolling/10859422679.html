<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Meditation undoubtedly helps to expand the silence within ourselves. Meditation is like an inner flashlight. When you enter into a dark room with a flashlight, immediately the room is illumined. When we enter with our meditation into our subconscious, unconscious, or even inconscient parts, immediately we feel that Light has dawned. And when the Light dawns, immediately the Divinity, which is the silence within us, gets the opportunity for expansion, universal expansion.</p>

Could you please describe them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Heaven means the higher worlds in this case. There are seven higher worlds and seven lower worlds. Each world has a music of its own and a note of its own. The higher worlds have a music that awakens us, inspires us, illumines us, perfects and fulfils us. The music of the higher worlds constantly comes to us as the harbinger of the highest Height, whereas the music of the lower worlds naturally comes to us as a messenger of destruction.</p>
<p>It is not only the higher and lower worlds that have a music of their own; each individual has his music, each movement has music, each action has music. Each time we breathe in and breathe out there is music. When we don't pay attention to the inner depth of the action, we don't hear the music. If we do pay adequate attention to each action, then inside the very depth of that action we are bound to hear music. Unless we hear music inside each action, the action is lifeless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can best silence the sounds of our mind by knowing that whatever the mind gives us is insufficient. The mind will never be able to give us the sense of satisfaction and perfection. It will always fall short of perfection.</p>
<p>But what will the heart give us? The heart will give us the message of identification, oneness, inseparable oneness with the Absolute, the Highest, the Universal and the Transcendental. On the strength of our identification with the Absolute we will get what He has. If He is eternal then we will become one with His Eternity. If He is infinite then we will become one with His Infinity. If He is immortal then we will become one with His Immortality. This is what we get on the strength of our identification with the heart.</p>
<p>A seeker has to know the limitations of the mind. The mind gets tremendous pleasure by limiting itself, by separating itself, by showing its own individuality. But the heart does not want to maintain its individuality or personality. It only wants to melt into the infinite Vast. A drop wants to enter into the mighty ocean and cries to become the ocean itself. If we have that kind of inner awareness, then we will be able to silence our mind. We will be able to silence the sounds of our mind and expand the silence of our heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual significance of the sound of <em>AUM</em> is earth's cry for Heaven's smile. This cry of earth ascends to the Highest Absolute. The Highest Absolute descends to the earth-cry, for they need each other. Earth needs the smile of Heaven so that it can claim that it is complete and perfect. And when Heaven hears the cry of earth it feels that it is complete and perfect. It is not that Heaven feels a kind of malicious pleasure from earth's cry, far from it. Only Heaven feels that earth has the real need for something high, divine and sublime. When a child has a real need for milk he cries and the mother immediately gives the child milk. But if the child is not crying for milk and the mother gives him milk, he will just throw it away. This happens quite often. But when earth feels a real need it cries and then Heaven has the opportunity to give what it has: Light infinite.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The divine Sound is the same for everyone. But if one's heart of receptivity has not grown sufficiently then he will hear the Sound only very faintly. And if when he is hearing it his mind starts functioning all of a sudden, then he will hear the divine Sound in a slightly different way. But the Sound is always the same. When an advanced person sees something, he sees it in its totality. But when someone is not advanced he sees only a portion of the reality. If a seeker is really advanced his interpretation, his embodiment or revelation of the Sound will be different from that of others who have just heard the Sound on a lower level. God-realisation is like a tree; you can come and touch the foot of the tree, you can climb up a little, or you can climb up to the highest branch and stop. And again you can come down with the fruit. If you ask me if everybody will have the same type of God-realisation, then I will answer, "No." Somebody will touch the tree of God-realisation and say, "Oh, it is like this." Somebody will climb up part of the way and say something else. Still another will climb up higher to the Highest and he will describe it in a different way. Then somebody will bring down the fruit and distribute it. Naturally his experience of the realisation-tree will be different. So also, the experience of the divine Sound will be different for each individual, although the reality itself is the same.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is the Will of God then the soul can run the fastest with the help of silence, inner silence. Or if God wants, the soul can run the fastest with the help of sound. There is no hard and fast rule. Some people aspire through manifestation; other people manifest through aspiration. Here, sound is manifestation and silence is aspiration. In some cases God manifests Himself in and through those whom He has given the capacity to aspire. Again there are some people whom He has given the capacity to aspire through devoting themselves to the supreme cause of manifesting the Reality, the Source. A seeker can run the fastest when he has the capacity of both aspiration and manifestation. It is like having two legs: one leg is aspiration, another leg is manifestation. If one uses both legs, then naturally he will run faster, much faster than if he used only one leg.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Sometimes it is quite necessary to have outer silence for half an hour or an hour, apart from one's deep meditation. When we talk unnecessarily it weakens us; it weakens our subtle nerves. Then at the time of our real meditation we won't be able to meditate well. This does not mean that you will remain silent for hour and hours. That will be an act of self-deception because outwardly you are keeping silent but inwardly your mind is in the gutter, roaming and roaming. That kind of silence is no silence. Only your mouth and tongue are not functioning. You are deliberately forcing the mouth not to open, but that is of no help. But fifteen minutes, half an hour or an hour of silence after the meditation or before the meditation will help us. If we observe silence before the meditation then it strengthens us. If we remain silent after the meditation is over then we get the opportunity to assimilate the Peace, Light and Bliss that we have received in abundant measure during our meditation.</p>
<p>This assimilation is of paramount importance because without it, all that we have received will be wasted.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I transform or incorporate into my meditation sounds from outside? At present I find sounds most disturbing.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I transform or incorporate into my meditation sounds from outside? At present I find sounds most disturbing." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning it is not advisable for seekers to incorporate outer sounds into their meditation. In the beginning it is always advisable to ignore the fact that there are sounds. In the beginning we have to be very careful and try to disassociate ourselves from imperfect things that create problems for us.</p>
<p>Suppose we have two rooms, a kitchen and a living room. The kitchen is in a mess, and the living room is in very good condition. If we don't have the eagerness or the capacity to fix and clean up the kitchen then we should remain in the living room and receive strength, joy and inner determination. When we have that we will then go into the kitchen and clean the dishes and so forth. So in the spiritual life a beginning seeker should meditate in a quiet place if at all possible. Right now it will be impossible for you to incorporate extraneous sounds into your meditation. It is like trying to unite the north pole and the south pole. Instead you should try to feel that your aspiration-power is infinitely more powerful than the sound that you are hearing. Even if you hear an atom bomb drop, you have to feel that your aspiration-power is infinitely more powerful than the sound of the atom bomb. When your aspiration is this tremendous, intense and powerful, then you can try to incorporate the sound itself into your own reality without disturbing your peace of mind. You will try to accept the sound with all its power, with all its destructive quality, and then transform it. But if you are not strong enough and you try to incorporate the sound, it will be sheer stupidity. Your meditation will be no meditation.</p>
<p>When you have enough willpower you can transform everything. But if the power of the thing you want to transform is greater than your willpower, then you have to remain separate. When you have more power you can accept it and transform it in your own way. When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I had to undergo an operation. The doctor was operating on me, and I was smiling at him. The doctor said. "Why are you smiling, why are you so happy? How is it that you are not shouting and screaming?" I said, "I know what kind of pain I was supposed to have while you were operating, but I have already transformed that pain into joy. That's why I am enjoying it." My concentration-power was on one side and the fear of the pain of the operation was on the other side. The pain and the fear had their own power, and my concentration also had its own power. But I knew that my power of concentration was much more powerful than the pain that I was about to undergo. Immediately before the operation took place I had transformed the pain into joy, and I was smiling and laughing. You yourself can eventually use willpower to transform the sounds that disturb you. But if you don't have the capacity right now, you should avoid them for the time being.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you go deep within you hear a sound similar to a gong. But unlike a gong, nothing has to be struck to produce this sound. When you hear it you can feel that it vibrates right from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head. Like a river that sound is flowing from its source deep in your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the soul it is quite possible. We use the term 'soundless sound'. When we chant <em>AUM</em> we use our tongue, our mouth, our earthly physical organs to produce an outer sound. In the outer world two things must strike together to produce sound. But in our heart, in the inmost recesses of our heart, there is a constant sound, a soundless sound going on. It is called <em>anahata nada</em> and it is unstruck. So in the heart, silence itself is the sound and sound itself is the silence. Silence embodies sound and sound embodies silence. When seekers are far advanced they hear that sound, the soundless sound.</p>

If somebody purposely comes and attacks me, self-defence is absolutely necessary. He who is attacking me or striking me is not my saviour — far from it. He has only surrendered to ignorance and that is why he is striking me, an innocent fellow. If I allow him to strike me as long as he wants to, it means that I am consciously helping him in his ignorance. No, I shall not attack anybody, but at the same time I shall not allow anybody to attack me because then I will not be able to do God's Will. If God wants me to do something for Him or God wants to act in and through me, then why should I surrender to somebody's ignorance and allow him to strike me? If I allow it then God's Purpose, God's Mission in me will remain unfulfilled and incomplete.</p>

How can I hear this voice more clearly?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can hear this voice more clearly if you try to feel that inside the physical heart there is a divine heart, an inner spiritual heart. First try to feel it inside you and then try to see it. Once you can see it you will hear this voice most clearly. Now you have to know that the heart that you are going to see is not smaller than the physical heart. We always feel that something must be smaller in order for it to fit inside something else. If I have a vessel and I want to put another one inside it, naturally the vessel that I am putting inside must be smaller. But in the case of the spiritual heart, it is not like that. The spiritual heart, which is inside the physical heart, is infinite. How can something infinite be inside the finite? Your mind will not be able to understand it. But God the Infinite Himself is within us; that is why we are praying and meditating. Similarly, the inner heart which is inside the heart is infinitely more powerful and infinitely larger than the physical heart. If you can see it once, then immediately you will be able to hear most clearly its strength, its capacity in the form of sound. When we enter inside the spiritual heart we can hear this sound most powerfully and constantly. To create this sound we don't have to strike anything. We call it <em>anahata,</em> unstruck sound. Here on the physical plane we must strike two hands together to produce a sound, but this most powerful inner sound is not struck by anything or anyone. This is the difference between earthly sound and inner sound.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the soul speak with an audible voice in the language that it spoke during life in another country?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the soul speak with an audible voice in the language that it spoke during life in another country?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul can adopt any language in order to express itself. The soul has the quintessence of God's capacity. God is omniscient; He knows everything. So each individual soul also has some limited capacity to know all the languages. The father teaches the child all that he knows, but the child learns according to his capacity. Father starts teaching the child the alphabet: A, B, C; and the child learns. Then after a few years the father teaches him a higher course. So the human in us, the body in us will not be able to speak in all the languages; only the soul can. But again, the soul does not actually use the language that we use. The soul uses the soul's language, which is Light. It is through Light that the soul expresses itself. When the soul's light expresses itself to the physical in us, the physical mind gets the message in a way it can understand. It is not actually words that the soul is using. The soul is offering and scattering its light and the physical is receiving it in the way that it convinces itself. The physical mind wants to become convinced in order to say something or feel something within. Unless the mind is convinced it is not satisfied. So when we hear the soul talking in human language, it is actually the mind that is receiving the soul's light in a way convincing to itself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know silence only when you become silence. And how can you become silence? You can become silence only when you feel that the Creator in you has a special purpose. He is creating you for his own manifestation on earth.</p>
