<p>Really good singers, I wish you to pay attention to my life-activities. We have had many favourite songs over the years. There are at least thirty songs that I compose each year that are very soulful, beautiful and powerful. These songs I take as part of my meditation, so you also may kindly take my songs as my meditation. If you take my path seriously, you have to give tremendous importance to my music-world, my song-world. Some of you are excellent singers. If you take my path seriously, then pay attention to my songs. My path and my songs are inseparable. My music, my songs come directly from my heart and from my soul. Kindly pay attention to your spiritual life in all its aspects.</p>
<p>Singing, singing, singing! There are some seekers and God-lovers who are not Tagore-worshippers, but how soulfully they practise and practise Tagore’s songs! In the same way, daily you can spend half an hour singing my songs.</p>
<p>Those who have the capacity, I beg of you to pay more attention to my music-world. There are many who cannot carry one single note, so I am not asking them.</p>
<p>No laziness! Please take everything seriously.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The most kind-hearted stewardess</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The most kind-hearted stewardess" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On July 2nd I gave a concert in Guatemala. [fn:5] Over three thousand people came. And how many disciples worked to organise the concert? Only six disciples! Six disciples worked so hard to bring three thousand people.</p>
<p>I wish to tell one special experience.</p>
<p>I boarded the plane in New York. A few minutes later the stewardess came up to me and asked, “Would you like to have some assistance when you come out of the plane? Will you need some assistance?”</p>
<p>I said, “No, I do not need it.”</p>
<p>“You do not want some assistance?”</p>
<p>“No, I do not want it. I will be able to manage.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me if you want some assistance. I will arrange it for you.”</p>
<p>I thanked her and said, “No, it is not necessary.”</p>
<p>She was very, very kind.</p>
<p>The food was non-vegetarian, and I did not take anything to eat. She asked me, “What would you like to have?”</p>
<p>I said, “I cannot eat the meal. I am a vegetarian.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I am sorry—there is nothing vegetarian. But can you have a bagel?”</p>
<p>I said, “O my God, that is something that I do not like! My teeth do not permit me to eat it.”</p>
<p>She brought me a very soft corn muffin and a few pieces of fruit, and she apologised that there was nothing else. I thanked her and said, “I do not need anything else.” Then she went away.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she came with the immigration form and gave it to me. After ten minutes she came back and asked me, “Have you filled out your form?”</p>
<p>I said, “No, not yet.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to fill it out for you?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, I will do it.”</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later again she said, “Shall I ask one of those who accompanied you to fill it out? Or let me do it.”</p>
<p>I said, “No, I will manage it.” I was at that time writing my Service-Trees. I had written around forty poems by that time. I have come back to New York with about eighty-two Service-Trees poems. The stewardess would never let me write my poems! She came again and asked me, “Have you done it? Have you filled out your form?” I said, “I have done it, I have done it!”</p>
<p>Then I told her, “You are a very, very kind-hearted stewardess.” She was so thrilled! She put both of her hands on my right shoulder and pressed it quite hard, and she said, “You are a very, very good man.” I called her kind-hearted, and she said I was very good! When she was showing me such affectionate concern, I was inspired to say, “I am a musician.”</p>
<p>“You are a musician?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and tomorrow I shall be performing in Guatemala. If you are free, do come.”</p>
<p>“Where is the concert?” “My students know the name of the hall. There are a few here on the plane.”</p>
<p>She could easily have forgotten about it, but she went to look for one of the disciples in another cabin and she got the name of the hall.</p>
<p>I never carry with me my credentials, my résumé or the book with photographs of my meetings with important people. Some people have written that I am a saint! I requested one of the disciples, “Please bring me something that I can show the stewardess about my qualifications.”</p>
<p>Alas, none of the disciples had anything! There was only something about my 12,000th Bengali song. Now, what would I say to this lady about my 12,000th song? What a disappointment!</p>
<p>When we arrived in Guatemala, Immigration was quite far, at least 150 or 200 metres. The way was not straight; it was zigzag, serpentine. Ahead of us there were many, many people. I think a plane had arrived just ahead of us. One of our boys was with me all the time, right behind me. The stewardess came to that area for some purpose and said goodbye, again smiling at me.</p>
<p>Ten or fifteen minutes later she came back with the Annam Brahma bag! This is the bag with my refreshments. She had gone back into the plane and she had got it from my seat. Is there any other stewardess who will run and run and run to bring my bag? The disciple who was accompanying me told her that another disciple was responsible for carrying that bag. So she took it back again, looking for that disciple.</p>
<p>Where can one find such a kind-hearted lady?</p>
<p>I gave one disciple the job to trace this stewardess. In the evening she tried very, very hard, and early the next morning she made about fifty calls. Some people in the airline office on the American side, alas, were on the verge of nastiness. In the Guatemalan airline office, people were very, very kind, but they were not able to help us. Kindness was available — nothing more.</p>
<p>Our disciple went to the airline office. At long last she found a sympathetic woman who happened to be the supervisor. When this lady saw that our disciple was imploring their kindness, she made a phone call to the stewardess. Unfortunately, the stewardess was not carrying her mobile phone. She had gone to attend a class, and they could not reach her. Then the supervisor phoned the mother of the stewardess! The mother said she had already got a ticket for a concert, which happened to be our concert, but she had lost it! She wanted to come to the concert, and a free ticket was necessary. Tickets were available at two or three places, and people had to come and collect them. It was all confusion; confusion-clouds were thickening!</p>
<p>Then the supervisor brought a photograph of the Pope, the one who recently passed on, with this particular stewardess. The supervisor brought it with such joy and pride, because one of her workers was able to have a picture taken with the Pope.</p>
<p>Finally the supervisor was able to get in touch with the stewardess, and she got the message that the stewardess would definitely, definitely come to our concert.</p>
<p>Now the confusion increased! The stewardess wanted to go to the airport to get a ticket for the concert. She said she did not have a ticket, and she thought she had to get it at the airport, which was so absurd!</p>
<p>Everything finally went well. I had invited the stewardess to come to our concert at a quarter to seven. The concert was supposed to take place at seven o’clock. Long before a quarter to seven the stewardess and her mother came in. The mother came up to me for my autograph. Her daughter said that afterwards they would not be able to see me. Once the concert was over it would be impossible for them to come and see me.</p>
<p>They were acting like my family members! The stewardess had also brought her daughter. The daughter’s name was Natalia. She was with her mother and grandmother. She was not in a happy mood. I gave the grandmother my autograph, and I wrote down her name. Her name was Lupe. She spoke very little English. I wrote something nice and then I drew three or four birds, as usual. She was so thrilled! Then I gave a small medallion to the grandmother to put on the granddaughter.</p>
<p>When the grandmother put the medallion around the little girl’s neck, immediately she entered into the seventh Heaven of delight! She had a medallion, and she was so thrilled, so thrilled! Then I asked the grandmother to put a large medallion around her daughter’s neck. She did it, and the daughter also put a medallion around her mother’s neck. They were all very, very happy.</p>
<p>I had drawn about one hundred pages of birds. Each page had at least five, ten or twenty birds. They were beautiful! I had my drawing book with me. I was rapidly going through the pages to find the best one. One page had many colours — four or five — plus many, many birds. There would have been at least two hundred or three hundred birds. I tore out the page and wrote down the granddaughter’s name; the stewardess’s name, which was Maria; and the grandmother’s name. While I was writing the names, they were so happy! They said, “We will frame it! We will frame it!” I had not yet given it to them, but they were saying, “We shall frame it! We shall immediately frame it!”</p>
<p>Then I went into my little room to practise before the concert. After practising, I expressed the desire to have a copy of my picture with the Pope. I said, “How I wish I could show this lady that I met with the Pope so many times! I have many, many pictures.” Somehow one of our boys had come to learn that the stewardess had a picture of herself with the Pope. Then this disciple appeared with two pictures. In one picture the Pope and I were holding the Peace Torch, and in the other one, the very first one, he had his arm on my shoulder. He was showing me such affection. This is called good luck. I was so thrilled!</p>
<p>Then I requested one of the disciples to go and bring only the stewardess to see me, not her mother or her daughter. She was so happy and thrilled with my pictures, and I autographed them for her. Then she sat right in front of me. With such affection and love, and all divine qualities, she was looking at me — like my most devoted, most sincere disciple. She was so happy, so happy!</p>
<p>They understood what our concert was about, and they liked it immensely. During the video about my activities, I was told that the grandmother was speaking almost sixteen to the dozen, so her daughter had to stop her and say, “Look, look at this! This is an important person!” She wanted her mother to see me on the screen with all the important people.</p>
<p>After the concert I requested one of the disciples to bring prasad to the stewardess, her mother and her daughter. Very, very happily they went home.</p>
<p>That is not the end of the story! Yesterday our plane was supposed to leave for New York at five o’clock, and I went to the airport at around three-thirty or a quarter to four. The disciples were there at two o’clock or two-thirty, because I had so many musical instruments. They kindly checked those instruments along with their own luggage.</p>
<p>As usual, I started moving around the airport, browsing. I went to a shop where they sold mostly clothing. I selected something very nice as a gift, and I was paying the cashier. I noticed that somebody was standing on my right side. A disciple said, “Guru, look who is standing there.” Right beside me I saw that stewardess! I was very happy. She looked at me with very gentle affection.</p>
<p>I wanted to give prasad at that time. We had two items. I asked one of the disciples to invite the stewardess. She came up and took prasad from me for herself and for her mother and daughter. Then something unimaginable happened! I was about to enter into the last place where people sit before submitting their tickets. I was nearing that place, and whom did I see? The stewardess with her whole crew! All five crew members were standing with folded hands. I could not believe it!</p>
<p>She said, “This is my crew, this is my whole crew!”</p>
<p>She was standing there, almost blocking my way, with her hands folded. They were all standing before me with folded hands. It was unimaginable! I had pictures taken with them. They were so happy, and they were smiling and smiling, with such respect.</p>
<p>Is it not absolutely the best experience that I got from this stewardess?</p>
<p>She comes to New York quite often. She arrives at eleven o’clock at night and then she has to catch the plane to return at five o’clock in the morning. She is determined to come and see us here in New York, so one of these days she will come.</p>
<p>Her name is Maria. Her daughter’s name is Natalia. Her mother’s name is Lupe. They have already become sweet members of our family. No other stewardess has given me this kind of most sincerely affectionate treatment.</p>

<p>One or two years ago we received from Scotland a rose called the Sri Chinmoy rose. Now from Holland we have got a tulip called the Sri Chinmoy tulip.</p>
<p>I have very, very, very special love, affection and fondness for tulips. The very word “tulip” gives me such joy! Immediate joy I get, immediate joy, when I hear the word. And I have seen where they grow tulips by the millions.</p>
<p>Unmukta gave me a variety of tulips to choose from, and I selected this particular one to have my name.</p>

<p>I had a dream, and the name of the dream was the Peace Run. This Peace Run, which we now call our World Harmony Run, is a dream, an ever-blossoming dream of our Source. This dream of ours will be valued infinitely more in the near future, and more so in the distant future.</p>
<p>We sang the song of God’s Peace. We are now running in the hearts, souls and lives of the runners. We are running in and through them. Each runner rightly deserves my most powerful gratitude. The Presidents, the Mayors and other dignitaries from various states and countries are helping us enormously through their stupendous encouragement. They are all peace-loving children of God. We are trying to serve God in a special way, and these peace-loving souls who are encouraging us wholeheartedly deserve my ever-blossoming gratitude.</p>
<p>True, our physical bodies have not been and will not be able to cover the length and breadth of the world. But the spirit that we have deep within, and the spirit that we truly are, has covered the length and breadth of the world many, many times. During my highest meditation, many, many times I have clearly seen that our self-giving spirit in all its beauty and fragrance has covered the length and the breadth of the world. Not only that, but something more: there are countless souls who have not seen the light of day, yet when they come into the world, they will feel, they are bound to feel this self-giving spirit that is circling and circling the world. The beauty, the fragrance, the light and delight of this spirit will kindle the flames of aspiration in the newcomers. They will also sing the same song of peace, universal peace.</p>
<p>Today’s chaotic world cannot forever remain chaotic. World harmony, world peace: these are not mere dictionary words. These are the realities, divine realities and supreme realities. For all of us who are aspiring to become good citizens of the world, our World Harmony Run is a supremely important inspiration to us all.</p>

<p>Dear ones, each time I complete one hundred songs in Bengali, I would like to invite each and every disciple to offer me a smaller-than-the-smallest gift. With your one-cent offering I will not become a multimillionaire, but I want you to participate in all my achievements. My task, to compose one hundred songs, is perhaps more difficult than yours! By my birthday I think I will be able to complete two hundred songs, so I kindly request two tiny gifts from you.</p>
<p>I want you all to participate, participate! Then you will value what I am doing. You will feel that you have taken part. In everything that I do, in my special achievements, I beg you to participate. Your participation in all my activities is of paramount importance in my life. You are my spiritual children. You participate, and you support me with your good wishes, your good will. I need your good will and good wishes.</p>
<p>So far about seventy songs I have composed. In a few days you will hear that I have completed one hundred. Talk about enthusiasm and dynamism! At the age of seventy-four I am practising it — not only preaching, but practising it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The only absolute certainty</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The only absolute certainty" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>From my experience, the highest reality offered by this world is uncertainty. In this world my own experience is that nothing is certain, absolutely nothing is certain. This is the highest reality the world has to offer. No matter what the world gives us, there is always uncertainty. The world’s achievement is not certain at all. <em>In</em> this world you can get the highest God-realisation; but <em>from</em> this world no matter what you get, you are uncertain, absolutely uncertain. From my own experience, uncertainty is the best superlative which this world can offer.</p>
<p>If you as a human being identify yourself with the world-consciousness, you may think that you are certain of what is going to happen; but the next moment you are absolutely uncertain. Even one second from now you cannot say what is going to happen. Today you are determined that you will not do this, you will not say this; but the next moment you may do something diametrically opposite. You promise that you will never be jealous of anyone, absolutely never. But what kind of determination do you have? From your repeated experience you should know that it is all uncertain. You promise that you will be a good human being, but what does your experience say? Your promise to yourself is uncertain; it does not last. It is good to keep that kind of promise, but inside that promise is uncertainty.</p>
<p>Certainty is a matter of trust, trust in yourself. If you trust yourself, then you know you will do this, you will say this, you will become this. You have certainty: you are positive that you will do this, you will say this, you will become this. But when you are not certain of your life, then distrust starts. If you cannot trust yourself, if you cannot trust your promise, then you break your promise. Again, once you break your promise, how can you trust yourself? Then once more you have to start from the beginning. It all stems from uncertainty. You have determination, but even inside your determination there is uncertainty.</p>
<p>Now I am talking about what you get <em>from</em> this world. But if you want to get something really valuable in this world, then God-realisation you can get; infinite Peace, Love and Bliss you can get. But you are not getting those things <em>from</em> this world.</p>
<p>If you are identified with this world, then you are giving the uncertainty-experience not only to yourself, but also to others. But again, if you identify with some inner force or with your Master or God, then everything is certain; it is going to happen. It may be delayed, it may be postponed, but definitely it is going to happen. Definitely you are going to be a perfect instrument; it is absolutely true. If you identify with me, then definitely it is a matter of time. It may be tomorrow; it may be in the distant future. But if you do not identify with me, then it is absolutely uncertain. Identification with me is the only thing that will give you certainty. The moment you lose that identification, the world will bring uncertainty into your body, vital, mind and heart, and even into your soul. The soul itself will suffer from uncertainty. The soul will say, “Will it really happen?”</p>
<p>To be one with me in the mind is always difficult, for the human mind is always doubtful; but even the mind will be certain if you identify with me. If the body is lethargic and the vital is aggressive, a dead elephant we can carry and a mad elephant we can control. But if doubt-cancer starts in the mind, it is very dangerous. When doubt-cancer spreads, that is spiritual death. Again, even doubt-cancer can be conquered if you become one with the Will of the Supreme in me.</p>
<p>If you are one with my will, then everything is certain, certain. But the moment you lose your oneness with my will, the story is finished; even your soul will suffer from uncertainty. The soul will be totally covered at that time by the body’s will, the vital’s will and the mind’s will. If oneness is missing, then it is all uncertainty.</p>
<p>If you identify yourself with the world, then you will always be uncertain. You cannot say that anything is definitely going to happen. Only constant oneness with God’s Will is all absolute certainty.</p>
