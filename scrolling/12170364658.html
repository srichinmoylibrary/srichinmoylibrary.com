<p>One of the hotel cooks came up to me and said, "Please tell me what you want. I will make you food. Do you like Spanish food?"</p>
<p>I said, "I do like Spanish food."</p>
<p>He went on, "Is there anything I can make for you?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Nothing right now, thank you."</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that the food is better here in Cancún, but I disagree wholeheartedly. I liked Israel and Lisette's preparation at Lake Atitlan infinitely more.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chatting with a man from Sri Lanka</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chatting with a man from Sri Lanka" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A Singhalese man came up to me. He lives in Canada and he wanted to chat with me. On that day all my guards were off-duty. They were enjoying a self-imposed holiday. They did not come to my rescue. Savyasachi was the worst culprit. He saw the man approaching me, but he did not do anything. Usually Savyasachi is quite good.</p>
<p>The man asked me, "Do you come from India?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>He continued, "Do you come from Bengal?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>Then he started telling me about one great man who came from Bengal.</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I know."</p>
<p>Then he told me that his name was Singha. I am pronouncing it the Bengali way, but he was pronouncing it the Singhalese way.</p>
<p>Then he went on with his questions. First he asked, "What religion are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "I come of a Hindu background, but I do not teach any religion. My love of God is my religion. For me, there is no other religion. I only pray to be a lover of God."</p>
<p>Then he wanted to know about my interest in politics. I said, "Some of the politicians are my friends and, by the way, do you come from Sri Lanka?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes."</p>
<p>I said, "President Premadasa was so kind and compassionate to me."</p>
<p>He exclaimed, "Premadasa!"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, President Premadasa."</p>
<p>Then he had to say, "All politicians are bad, but he was the worst possible crook!"</p>
<p>I was simply shocked. It was too much for me. I thought of changing the subject. I said, "My dearest friend is Ananda Guruge. He was Ambassador to the United States and in various ways he served his country. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, I know him." Then he said, "I shall come back and we shall discuss religion."</p>
<p>I said, "For me the only religion is love of God."</p>
<p>Then he said a few other things, but by that time I was only looking this side and that side for my guards to come and rescue me. I did not have the heart to ask the man his first name. As soon as I heard that, according to him, President Premadasa was the worst possible crook, I was desperately trying to find a way to end the conversation. President Premadasa was such a lion-hero in the battlefield of life. But how can you please everybody? It is impossible. I have such fond memories of Sri Lanka and all my meetings with the President.</p>
<p>In Kandy, in the Temple of the Tooth Relic, the main priest took me into a special room. He closed the door and said, "Nobody should see this." Then he put the crown on my head.</p>
<p>We Indians are so grateful to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka saw spiritual genius in Swami Vivekananda. Sri Lanka embraced Swami Vivekananda's philosophy. That is why we have such love for Sri Lanka. Whoever appreciates our heroes, specially our spiritual heroes, will always be admired, adored and loved by India.</p>

<p>I have received letters from both of President Gorbachev's granddaughters. The youngest one is Anastasia. Her nickname is Nastia. Today, strangely enough, we went to a supermarket, and there I saw some bags with her name, "Anastasia". I wanted to buy one for her but I could not find out the price.</p>
<p>I waited and waited for the sales assistant to tell me the price. Finally, she said, "It is ten per cent off."</p>
<p>I said, "Ten per cent off what price?"</p>
<p>But she did not know the original price.</p>
<p>I said, "Say anything you like. I really want to have this particular bag."</p>
<p>Then she went to get the actual price, but, alas, she never came back. So I could not buy the bag.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Meditating and composing songs</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Meditating and composing songs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I spontaneously set to music 201 Bengali songs during our four-hour meditation in the grounds of the Sheraton Hotel. Sometimes I was singing alone, and then the disciples were learning the song and singing with me. I was having a wonderful meditation. While we were singing, the sky made a solemn promise to meditate on our behalf. The disciples were not looking at the sky, but I saw that the sky was meditating on our behalf.</p>
<p>When we pray to God and meditate on God, everything helps us. When Lord Buddha realised God at the foot of the boddhi tree, the tree itself was helping him. Today the vastness of the sky was helping us. The silence-swing of the sky was cradling us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A visitor in the inner world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A visitor in the inner world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>On January 7th, we had our first seven-hour meditation for this year. I do hope that we can have a seven-hour meditation on the 7th of every month.</p>
<p>During the meditation, when the disciples were singing "<em>Nimne dharanir</em>", the great spiritual Master Gorakshanath came to me in the inner world and said, "When I was on earth I performed so many miracles."</p>
<p>Gorakshanath had tremendous occult and spiritual power. Because of him, for months there would be no rain. If I say there should be no rain, immediately there will be a downpour!</p>
<p>The higher you go, the less you perform miracles outwardly and the more you perform miracles inwardly. Again, sometimes a herowarrior has to examine whether his swords are sharp or not, if they are blunt or if they are still working. He has to see if they are in good condition. Otherwise, they can be rusty and dusty. But, in the case of most spiritual Masters, all this takes place inwardly.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you do not know that the day before yesterday the Mayor of Guatemala City, Oscar Berger, declared that Guatemala City has become another Peace-Blossom Capital.</p>
<p>How did I find out? I am staying here in Cancún, Mexico. I called Minati at my house in New York.</p>
<p>I asked her, "What news?"</p>
<p>Minati said, "Guru, I am sure you know already."</p>
<p>I said, "What is the good news?" Then she told me all about what the Mayor had done.</p>
<p>I was so surprised. I asked her, "How could you know? How did you get this news?"</p>
<p>She said, "Dipali told me."</p>
<p>And how did Dipali know? She found out from one girl in Houston. This girl phoned up Dipali and gave her the good news. So Minati is the right person to tell me!</p>
<p>Just one week ago, the Governor of the area where we were staying in Lake Atitlan declared that Lake Atitlan is now a Sri Chinmoy Peace Lake.</p>

<p>Now we have come back to Cancún for the second time. This place is so beautiful. I am happy we came back.</p>
<p>The other day I was in the elevator together with a stout, elderly man.</p>
<p>He asked, "Do you speak Spanish?"</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>He went on, "Where do you come from?" I replied, "India." He asked, "May I ask you where?"</p>
<p>I told him, "I come from Chittagong." Then I asked him where he came from.</p>
<p>He said, "I come from Chicago."</p>
<p>He began joking with me that he did not know where Chittagong is.</p>
<p>I said, "It is not in Ill."</p>
<p>He said, "What do you mean — ill?"</p>
<p>I said, "It is not in Illinois. The abbreviation I am telling you."</p>
<p>When I used to work at the Indian Consulate, how many times I used to write Chicago and then "Ill." I would put the passport inside the brown envelope and then write down the name of the Indians in Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>What is the great similarity between Chicago and my disciples? Unpredictable weather! Chicago's outer weather is unpredictable, and the disciples' inner weather is also unpredictable.</p>
