<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Name is the most effective mantra for each runner. There are two ways to repeat God's Name: even if you are running a marathon, if you are inspired to repeat God's Name as fast as possible, then do it. Again, if you are inspired to draw deep breaths and very slowly and quietly repeat God's Name, that is also most effective.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The vital should be happy but, at the same time, the vital should not get malicious pleasure by defeating others. When we win, we have to feel that it is the standard of humanity that has gone high. If I have defeated you, then I should not get malicious pleasure. Only I should say, "You and I are one. You are part and parcel of humanity and I am also part and parcel of humanity. So in my achievement, it is humanity's progress."</p>
<p>Whether we win or whether we are defeated, that is how we should observe sports. That is the best type of happiness, to feel that humanity has made progress.</p>
<p>Recently Sudhahota Carl Lewis and his team-mates won the 4x100 metres relay and broke the world record. That record was established ten years ago. So it took ten years to break the record. Look at humanity's progress! So now, who has won? Here the Supreme has won through Sudhahota and his colleagues. It is the Supreme's progress that Sudhahota and his team have shown to the world at large. Previously the Supreme acted in and through four individuals to set the record; now He has acted in and through four individuals to create a new record and, when the time comes, He will make progress through four more individuals.</p>
<p>Our vital should be happy with the progress of humanity. That is the right attitude. Otherwise, if we think that it is our vital, our capacity, which has done something great, if we extol ourselves to the skies, then in a few days or a few months or a few years, our pride will be smashed.</p>
<p>The winners should always feel happiness on the strength of their oneness with Mother Earth, with humanity. Humanity has made progress in and through them and they were the perfect instruments for humanity to come one step higher.</p>
<p>Not only the vital should be happy, but the mind should also be very happy. The mind should feel that it is not the individual mind that has succeeded; it is the collective mind through an individual that has made this progress. So the mind should be very happy for the progress that was brought about.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Somebody takes steroids and he feels that it is his individual problem. He does not realise that he is part of humanity. If you do something right, then you help humanity. If you do something wrong, do not think that only you as an individual will be affected. No, everybody will be affected. By doing something wrong, we bring down the progress of humanity.</p>
<p>People who do wrong things create wrong movements, wrong vibrations, in the earth atmosphere, and then innocent people suffer. Likewise, humanity at large gets tremendous benefit from the aspiration of spiritual people. Spiritual people come into the world to elevate the consciousness of humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am the right person to answer this question! My muscles cannot go beyond the boundary of 14 inches for my biceps, and there are people here whose biceps are 15 or 16 inches. Some people have big muscles, but they do not have strength, while others have small muscles but enormous strength.</p>
<p>If you have big muscles, it gives you joy and you get more confidence. Again, if you know that you can lift up heavy weights, then your confidence is already established and you do not need big muscles.</p>
<p>In my case, you can say that grapes are sour! I tried to have big muscles. I told Mahasamrat Bill Pearl that I was going to make my biceps 15 inches. Recently he measured my arms and nothing had increased although I have taken so much exercise. So now I can say it is not necessary to have big muscles!</p>

What is your comment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Top athletes like Carl Lewis speak about being relaxed. What is your comment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Relaxation is of supreme importance in the life of Sudhahota Carl Lewis and for all athletes. First you have to relax psychically, in your heart. Then you have to relax mentally, then vitally and then physically. If you are relaxed when you, as an individual, want to do something, then you get a force inside your heart, mind, vital and physical. You are also getting a force inside your soul. Five strong forces, inner forces, are helping you secretly. Relaxation means help from the inner, secret world.</p>
<p>So in everything you do, relaxation is of paramount importance. But it must be relaxation. It is not a matter of enjoying lethargy. Relaxation can take place sooner than the soonest if you can make your mind calm, quiet, vacant. If you can make your mind calm and quiet, you will see relaxation of the various parts of your being can be achieved very quickly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If an athlete is a sprinter, he will meditate on speed; he should imagine that he is increasing his speed. A jumper will meditate on height; he should imagine that he has the capacity to jump higher. Imagination has a reality of its own. It is a creation in its own right. So first you have to enter into the world of imagination. It is not mental hallucination — far from it! Then bring this imagination into the world of inspiration, then the world of aspiration, then the world of dedication, then revelation and then manifestation. Step by step you have to proceed. But we have to start with the world of imagination first.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Lifting up human beings looks very easy for you.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; Lifting up human beings looks very easy for you." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tomorrow I shall complete 1,300. It will be my last day of lifting.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Why do you want it to be your last?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Somewhere I have to stop! I have been to six continents and I will have lifted 1,300 human beings. It is enough for me.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You have not puffed up exactly. You do not have a huge frame. What are the principles you use? What has made you this strong without looking huge?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Prayer and meditation. I pray and meditate and I entirely depend on God's Grace, God's Compassion.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Before you used to run and then I understand that you hurt yourself?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I ran beyond my capacity and hurt my right knee. I should not have run 22 marathons and a few ultra-marathons. It was not meant for me. In India, I was a sprinter.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> You are built more like a sprinter.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I was brought up in a spiritual community. There I practised sports — running, jumping, throwing and so forth.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> The prayer and meditation you do, are they more or less helpful according to what type of training you do?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is prayer and meditation that bring to me the things that are necessary, essential. Prayer and meditation determine beforehand what is needed. To give you an example: here in America, I needed some special weightlifting equipment. God envisioned the fulfilment of His Dream in and through me, and God chose an Australian student of mine as the instrument to build my exercise machines. I sincerely feel it is a great blessing and God's boundless Grace. He has helped me tremendously, far, far beyond my imagination, in my weightlifting world for the last four years.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> But God wanted you to work to achieve it.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, physically and spiritually. Matter and spirit must go together. Spirit is within, matter is without. We have to sow the seed under the ground. Then only it germinates and becomes a tiny plant, and then a huge tree, a banyan tree. But the seed was sown under the ground. Similarly, our inner life comes first. When the inner life comes to the fore, it accepts, assimilates and transforms the outer life in order to make us perfect.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Right before you lifted, I saw you focussing. In sports now the big thing is visualisation. Were you doing anything of that or was it just prayer?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time, I was only silencing my mind. When I do anything, to start with I silence my mind. When I silence my mind, tremendous energy flows in and through me; I draw cosmic energy. As soon as I silence my mind, cosmic energy enters into my entire being.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Are you thinking anything?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just the opposite; my mind is absolutely blank. Once you silence the mind, it becomes as vast as the sky, as vast as the ocean. When we think, we limit ourselves. Thoughts enter into our mind in a fleeting second. It is like a tug-of-war or a zoo. But if we silence the mind, then we feel that we are flying in the sky like a bird. The sky is not affected by the bird flying and the bird is enjoying itself and getting energy and inspiration from the sky itself.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> It is very similar, really, to what they talk of as the white zone in sports. The athlete gets to the purely instinctive level where there is no thought. When you are first learning, you analyse what you are doing. At a certain point, you stop.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you reach a certain level, it becomes automatic. A singer takes lessons for years, but once he develops a haunting voice, he does not have to go through all the preliminary exercises. When he is actually performing, he does not have to worry. A dancer learns all the steps while practising, but at the time of the actual performance, his movements will be spontaneous. Something reveals itself from within.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> The irony of it is that it is trained instinct.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no time to think, you just do it. There is a spontaneous joy. When we practise, we develop confidence. If we do not practise, we have no idea what we can do, how much can be brought to the fore.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: May we have a tune from your flute before I talk to you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="&lt;em&gt;Question:&lt;/em&gt; May we have a tune from your flute before I talk to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy plays the flute)</em></p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Is that something you made up yourself on the spur of the moment?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Please tell us about yourself. You flew into Hong Kong yesterday and this is part of a tour of Southeast Asia. And you are promoting a programme that is known as "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart." Can you explain all that?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a Truth-seeker and a God-lover. I feel that it is my bounden duty to be of service to mankind. "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart" is our theme. I feel that if we have peace of mind, we will be able to raise the consciousness of mankind. This world belongs to God the Creator and, at the same time, God the Creator has become God the Creation. Therefore, I go from one place to another and try to offer my soulful services to the citizens of each particular country.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> This is a message that you are getting from within?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, from my Inner Pilot. Each person is led by something. Most often it is our mind that asks us to do something and we abide by the dictates of the mind. Again, if we pray and meditate regularly, soulfully and devotedly, we can listen to the voice of our heart. So, in my case, I try to listen to the voice of my heart and I try to establish my inseparable oneness with the world.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> People listening to this programme might find that a little difficult to understand or they might wonder what your motives are.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This world is full of misunderstanding. Misunderstanding reigns supreme in this world. God alone is to judge whether my motives are sincere and genuine. Here I have not come to propagate my views. Here I have come to be of dedicated service to mankind. I have been to many, many parts of the world to offer the same dedicated and devoted service.</p>
<p>This "Lifting Up the World" programme is quite recent. I have not even been doing it a full year. For the last three years I have been lifting up weights just for physical fitness. Previously I was a runner, but I had to stop running because of a severe knee injury. Then I took up weightlifting. By God's Grace, I got amazing results. And then, for the last six months, I have been lifting up human beings.</p>
<p>I believe that each individual has a body, vital, mind, heart and soul. So, while lifting up the person, I feel I am offering my dedicated service to that person and, with my dedicated service, I feel I am able to bring to the fore their own divine qualities which are of paramount importance so that we can lift up the world together.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What sort of people have you lifted?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have lifted people from all walks of life: diplomats from the United Nations, professors, boxers, singers, athletes, weightlifters, priests, nuns, doctors, lawyers and so forth.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How much do you weigh?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually I weigh between 151 and 157 pounds.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Who is the heaviest person you have lifted?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In California, I lifted a great saxaphone player named Clarence Clemons. He is known as the 'Big Man'. He was 283 pounds.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Almost double your own weight!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. And yesterday, here in Hong Kong, I lifted two photographers at the same time. Their combined weight was 265 pounds.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> We have to mention at this stage that you lift people with one arm. Which arm is it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I lift with both my left and my right arms. They are almost equally strong.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How do you manage to lift up double your bodyweight with one arm?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's infinite Grace acts in and through me. I was never a weightlifter. In my youth, I was a sprinter, a decathlete. I was a runner all my life. But for the last three years, I have been lifting up weights. Here I have entered into a new field. I do not compete with others, but I enjoy competing with myself. I started with 40 pounds. Three years ago, it was almost impossible for me to lift up 40 pounds. Then gradually, slowly, steadily and unerringly, I have made progress and now I have come up to this.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Do the people whom you lift get an uplifting experience? Excuse the pun! Do they feel much better for it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of them say that it is not only on the physical plane that they are lifted, but also in the inner plane. About six months ago, a nun came from Philadelphia to participate. When she was lifted, she said she had the experience that both her body and spirit were lifted together. And, interestingly enough, on that particular day her horoscope read that somebody was going to lift her, physically as well as spiritually. So she came all the way from Philadelphia to New York. After I lifted her up, she narrated her experience.</p>
<p><em>Interviewer:</em> I am glad it worked for her. Let us hope it works for those people who are going to be lifted here in Hong Kong later today. Sri Chinmoy, thank you very much and I wish you good luck in your quest for "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart."</p>
