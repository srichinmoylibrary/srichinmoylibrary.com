  <h2 id="page-title">Scene I</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene I" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(King Shibi’s palace. King, Prince and Princess are enjoying a family talk.)</em></p>
<p>PRINCESS: Father, I love you. Father, I am afraid of you.</p>
<p>KING: Why do you love me?</p>
<p>PRINCESS: I love you because your heart is all love.</p>
<p>KING: Why are you afraid of me?</p>
<p>PRINCESS: I am afraid of you because you are so great, unimaginably great. Father, please give me some sound advice. I know you don’t want me to be afraid of you all the time.</p>
<p>KING: My child, let me tell you the real reason that you love me and the reason that you are afraid of me. Your heart and soul know how to enter into my heart and soul and become one with them. Therefore, you love me deeply. You are afraid of me because your vital and mind are weak. Your vital does not want to expand along with mine, Your mind does not have the same amount of faith in God as my mind has. For these two reasons you are afraid of me, and not because I am so great. Expand your dynamic vital. Your problem will be solved. Fill your mind with the life-saving and life-fulfilling faith. Your problem will be solved.</p>
<p>PRINCESS: Father, I shall do it. Father, I shall do it. I shall prove to be worthy of having you as my father and I shall prove to be a worthy Princess.</p>
<p>KING: Moreover, my child, if I am great, then you are also great. You are my daughter. What I have as a father and as a King is all yours. My greatness will never frighten you. My greatness will only inspire you to enter into my greatness and claim it as your very own. Now that I have told you the real reason that you are afraid of me, I am sure all your problems will be solved. My child, don’t be afraid of me. Take what I have. Be what I am.</p>
<p>PRINCESS: Father, I shall. Father, I shall be.</p>
<p>PRINCE: Now it is my turn. Father, I do not love you, but I admire you. I am not afraid of you, but I am jealous of you.</p>
<p>KING: I appreciate your sincerity, my son. Now, tell me, why do you admire me and what makes you jealous of me?</p>
<p>PRINCE: I admire you because you are powerful, the most powerful in the world. Everybody is at your command. Everybody is at your mercy. I am jealous of you because everybody adores you and touches your feet. Alas, they do not adore me. They do not touch my feet. They just smile at me.</p>
<p>KING: When I grow old, I shall retire. You will replace me. At that time, the world will adore you and touch your feet.</p>
<p>PRINCESS: I don’t think so. Father, everybody adores you and touches your feet not because you are most powerful, not because you are the greatest King, but because you are all love, all concern and all compassion. My brother does not have these divine qualities in the least, so why should the world adore him and touch his feet?</p>
<p>PRINCE: Father, look! Look! She is really jealous of me. Father, I have all the good qualities that you have and a few more. I run. You can’t run. I sing. You can’t sing. I climb. You can’t climb. I swim and you can’t swim.</p>
<p>PRINCESS <em>(sarcastically)</em>: You fool, you have mentioned all your great qualities. I assure you that these qualities will not draw even one person toward you. It is simply impossible for the world to adore you and touch your feet for such common qualities. Don’t fool yourself. Try to become great inwardly, like our father, with all the divine qualities of the heart. Then only will you really be happy, adored and worshipped by all.</p>
<p>PRINCE: Stop! Stop! Don’t preach! I can take care of my life. I shall take care of Father’s Kingdom. Needless to say, I shall take care of your life, too, when I become King.</p>
<p>PRINCESS: For God’s sake, you don’t have to take care of my life. I have two fathers to take care of my life. As long as this father is on earth, he will take care of my life. When he <em>(pointing at the King)</em> ends his earthly pilgrimage, my eternal Father will take care of my life. So you will be given no chance to take care of my heart’s aspiration, my life’s dedication and my soul’s surrender.</p>
<p>KING <em>(blessing the Prince)</em>: Son, my outer wealth shall satisfy you. <em>(Blessing the Princess.)</em> Daughter, my awakened daughter, my inner wealth shall illumine and fulfil you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Scene II</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene II" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(Three minor gods in Heaven.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST GOD: That King Shibi, on earth, is disturbing my inner poise.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: Mine too.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: Dear friends, what is wrong with Shibi? What is wrong with you two?</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: That Shibi has become a very great aspirant. Soon he will become a most advanced soul.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: Shibi’s heart is as vast as the ocean of love and compassion. His soul is illumination itself.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: So what? If Shibi really becomes great or is already great, then we should be proud of him instead of jealous. He is, after all, God’s most devoted son.</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: Today Shibi is great. Tomorrow he will be greater. The day after tomorrow he will be the greatest. And then he will outshine us all.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD <em>(looking at the third god)</em>: When the matchless glory of his life badly eclipses your inner sun, perhaps you will know what a stupid god you are. Don’t be philosophical, for God’s sake. Be practical.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: It is a real shame that even the gods are jealous of a human being. <em>(Looking up.)</em> O God, You are truly kind to me. You have made me a perfect stranger to jealousy. Whosoever is great, whosoever possesses God’s Divine Greatness, will be admired and adored by me, be he a human being or even an animal.</p>
<p>FIRST GOD: Since you have come to that kind of realisation, to me you are worse than an animal.</p>
<p>SECOND GOD: You are absolutely right, my good friend. He is undoubtedly inferior even to an animal. <em>(Looking at the third god.)</em> Go back to your most undeveloped stone life, to the mineral kingdom, for that is where you belong.</p>
<p>THIRD GOD: You two are corrupting the purity and beauty of Heaven with your impure and wild jealousy. I pronounce my most powerful curse on you. Heaven will soon get rid of you two. You two have cast a slur on Heaven. Poor Heaven, my Heaven, Indra’s Heaven, Brahma’s Heaven!</p>
<p>FIRST AND SECOND GODS: One more word and you will be found in the stone life. We shall extinguish your life in Heaven!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>
<p><em>(The three gods, as if nothing has happened, show their utmost reverence to Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: Occultly we have observed your most deplorable dispute. Even Indra and I are not sure if Shibi is that great.</p>
<p>INDRA: So we have decided to go to Shibi’s palace on earth to test him.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: If he is really that great, then we should and we must admire him — his love, his concern, his compassion and his sacrifice.</p>
<p>INDRA: And if he is not all that we hear about him, then the jealous gods can be happy.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Hard is it to conquer jealousy.</p>
<p>INDRA: Alas, I suffered from that disease for a long time, but now jealousy and I do not live together. We live separately, we think separately and we fulfil our ideals separately. Now I am ready to touch the feet of anybody who is superior to me in spirituality.</p>
<p>BRAHMA: Indra, I admire your sincerity. I adore your humility,</p>
<p>INDRA <em>(to the minor gods, smiling)</em>: You three wait here and see. We two are entering into the world. Brahma will assume the form of a huge hawk and I shall assume the form of a tiny dove.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Scene III</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene III" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(King Shibi’s palace. The King and Queen are sitting on their thrones. The Prince and Princess are also present. Suddenly a beautiful dove flies in.)</em></p>
<p>DOVE: O King Shibi, save me, save me! In you I seek my haven.</p>
<p>I fear to speak, I fear to speak.</p>
<p>My tongue is killed, my heart is weak. I fear to be, I fear to be. Long dead my life of faith in me.</p>
<p>KING <em>(caressing the dove)</em>: Sweet bird, cast aside all your fear. My concern is for you. My protection is for you. I am all for you.</p>
<p><em>(A huge hawk flies in and starts chasing the dove. The King stops him and places the dove in his protecting lap.)</em></p>
<p>HAWK: King, this bird is my prey. This bird is mine! You are grabbing my possession. I have worked hard to get this bird. O King, I am hungry. As you have the right to deal with human beings, so have I the right to deal with birds. O King, please don’t be greedy. I eat my food and you eat yours.</p>
<p>KING: O hawk, you are powerful, but I believe I am more powerful. You say that you are hungry. I shall feed you. Tell me what meat you would like to eat. Do you care for deer’s meat? Do you care for bull’s meat? Do you care for boar’s meat? Just tell me what kind of meat you like best. In no time I shall feed you.</p>
<p>HAWK: To tell the truth, I care only for dove’s meat.</p>
<p>KING: Unfortunately, that is impossible. The dove is under my adamantine protection. Any other meat I can give you and I shall give you, immediately and without fail.</p>
<p>HAWK: Are you sure? Will you not eat your words?</p>
<p>KING: Never. I give my word of honour.</p>
<p>HAWK: Then, O King, give me immediately the flesh of your own body equal in weight to the weight of this dove!</p>
<p>KING: That’s all? Take it gladly. I give you my flesh.</p>
<p><em>(Shibi orders a pair of scales and a big, sharp knife. A servant brings them.)</em></p>
<p>HAWK: I am sick of hearing about your compassion. Here is a golden chance to prove it. One thing more: I want the piece of flesh right from your chest, and I want you to put the flesh on the scale and weigh it. Until the weight of the flash is equal to that of the dove, I will not be satisfied!</p>
<p><em>(Shibi smiles and stabs his own chest and cuts out a piece of flesh and puts it on the scale opposite the dove. The bird weighs more.)</em></p>
<p>QUEEN <em>(bursting into tears)</em>: No more, my Lord, no more! I can’t stand it. You rascal hawk! Be satisfied with this one piece. Otherwise, I shall order my soldiers to kill you.</p>
<p>HAWK: O Queen, you had better speak to the King. I know it is not an easy task to keep one’s promise.</p>
<p>KING: I shall keep my promise. I shall take more flesh out of my body.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Impossible! My heart shall not permit you to do so. I claim your body to be mine, absolutely mine. Therefore, I shall not allow you to cut this body of mine. <em>(Holding firm her husband’s hands.)</em> Now, you animal! <em>(Looking at the hawk.)</em> Only an animal can ask for human flesh! Look, since my husband and I are one, this time I am going to offer my flesh to add to my husband’s flesh. I am sure that after this it will equal the weight of the dove. You filthy creature!</p>
<p>HAWK: Queen, call me what you will. After all, it is your own husband’s promise. If he fails, he fails. The world will laugh at him, at his so-called compassion. Anyway, I am not going to accept your flesh; I want only his flesh.</p>
<p>KING: You are right, hawk. My flesh, only my flesh.</p>
<p><em>(The Queen starts weeping and screaming, and cursing the hawk. The King cheerfully cuts another piece of flesh from his chest and puts it on the scale. To everyone’s surprise, the dove still weighs more.)</em></p>
<p>HAWK: All right. King, you can cut flesh from any part of your body you want to. But it must all equal the weight of the dove.</p>
<p>KING: Thank you, my kind friend.</p>
<p><em>(This time the King cuts a very large piece of flesh from his right arm and places it on the scale. Still the dove weighs more. Everybody is surprised and horror-struck. The Prince and Princess are bitterly crying, shedding helpless tears.)</em></p>
<p>PRINCESS: It is Father’s promise, therefore I am helpless.</p>
<p>PRINCE: Sister, I know what you mean about Father’s promise. I too am helpless. Otherwise, by this time I would have kicked this ugly animal out.</p>
<p>KING: My daughter, my son, please, please allow me to fulfil my promise peacefully and cheerfully.</p>
<p><em>(This time the King cuts quite a few pieces from his body and puts them on the scale opposite the dove. Alas even then the dove weighs more. Disappointed, disheartened and utterly bewildered, he slowly steps onto the scale with his whole body. The scale now balances perfectly. The two birds immediately assume the forms of Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>
<p>BRAHMA: O peerless King Shibi, you deserve love, admiration and adoration from God’s entire creation. I tested you. I was the hawk.</p>
<p>INDRA: I was the dove. Your heart is the infinite Compassion of the Supreme. Your life is the transcendental Pride of the Supreme.</p>
<p><em>(Shibi bows down to Brahma and Indra.)</em></p>

<p>NARRATOR: Every day Surya draws his golden chariot across the heavens, offering light and illumination to the heavens and to the earth.</p>
<p><em>(In Heaven a cosmic god is speaking to Surya.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST COSMIC GOD: Surya, what is wrong with you today? Why are you so unhappy, O sun-god? Your unhappiness is creating tremendous problems for earth. Earth has become all darkness. There is tremendous chaos there. If you go on this way, if you have a heavy heart and do not do your job, the earth will be doomed. Heaven also will be doomed. It is your presence that illumines the heavens as well as the earth. Tell me, Surya, what is wrong with you today?</p>
<p>SURYA: I shall confide in you. I am in love.</p>
<p>FIRST COSMIC GOD: You are in love? With whom are you in love?</p>
<p>SURYA: I am in love with a most beautiful girl whom I saw yesterday when I was riding across the heavens. Her beauty has conquered my heart. Her beauty has enslaved my mind. The memory of her beauty is torturing me. I cannot do anything but think of her. My heart is crying for her. What shall I do?</p>

<p><em>(The cosmic gods are having a meeting.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST COSMIC GOD: Something has to be done. If Surya goes on in this way, if he does not do his job, then we will be in total darkness.</p>
<p>SECOND COSMIC GOD: The <em>asuras</em> will destroy the earth. Earth will cry to us for blessings, and we will not be able to offer any. Earth will cry in utter despair, and we will be helpless.</p>
<p>THIRD COSMIC GOD: And we will be destroyed ourselves very soon if Surya does not come back and offer his light to us.</p>
<p>VAYU: Don’t worry. I am going in search of that girl. I shall find her, and then I shall make arrangements for her to marry Surya.</p>
<p>FOURTH COSMIC GOD: If you are successful, we shall be most grateful.</p>
<p>FIFTH COSMIC GOD: And if you are not, then we shall all be ruined.</p>
<p>VAYU: Don’t worry, my friends. I know I have the capacity. I can easily find out who she is; I can easily get them together; I can easily arrange for their marriage.</p>
<p>COSMIC GODS <em>(together)</em>: All our joy, all our love, all our gratitude to you, dearest brother Vayu.</p>

<p><em>(A most beautiful girl is sitting in a corner of the Celestial Dwellings. Enter Vayu.)</em></p>
<p>VAYU: You! Ah, I have discovered you at last. Please tell me your name. <em>(She gives him a sulky smile.)</em> Tell me. Tell me, please. Our Lord Surya is deeply in love with you. Because of you, he is not doing his work anymore and we shall soon be plunged into total darkness. Tell me, tell me who you are or Heaven and earth will perish. Whose daughter are you?</p>
<p>SANJNA: My name is Sanjna. My father is Vishwakarma.</p>
<p>VAYU: Your father is Vishwakarma? You are his daughter? Come, let us go to your father’s house. I shall tell him all about our Surya’s love for you.</p>
<p>SANJNA: Are you sure he loves me?</p>
<p>VAYU: Loves you! Loves you! That is an understatement. His heart is crying for you. His heart is breaking for you. He can think of nothing but you. He needs you; he desperately needs you, and he wants to marry you. All the cosmic gods will celebrate your wedding. We shall all have infinite joy, infinite delight to see you two united.</p>

<p><em>(Vishwakarma’s home. Enter Sanjna with Vayu.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAKARMA: Sanjna, I have told you repeatedly not to speak to strangers. What do you mean by bringing home an unknown person to me?</p>
<p>VAYU: O Vishwakarma, I may not be known to you, but you are well known to me. I have not come here to hurt you or to hurt your daughter. I have come to tell you something that will give you enormous joy. The sun-god, Surya, without whom we cannot exist, is in love with your daughter. All the cosmic gods have met together, and they have sent me to you. Please listen to our prayer. Allow your daughter to marry Surya. Their marriage will have the blessings of the entire earth and all the higher worlds.</p>
<p>VISHWAKARMA: I can’t believe my ears! I can’t believe my eyes! Surya likes my daughter!?</p>
<p>SANJNA: Likes! Likes! He loves me!</p>
<p>VAYU: O Vishwakarma, you ask if Surya likes your daughter. She says that he loves her. But I wish to say that both of these are understatements. Your daughter has unconditionally conquered his heart. He is pining away for her.</p>
<p>VISHWAKARMA: Then let us not delay. Let us arrange for the wedding to be celebrated as soon as possible. Where will it take place?</p>
<p>VAYU: In the highest regions of Heaven. Tomorrow you bring your daughter, and all the cosmic gods will be there. We shall celebrate the wedding of Surya and Sanjna.</p>

<p>NARRATOR: All the cosmic gods are present. Surya and Sanjna’s wedding takes place. Now Surya has become the happiest god. Once again he draws his chariot across the heavens with enormous delight. Earth is extremely happy with their marriage, since earth is once more getting sunshine. Heaven is happy, since Heaven is getting illumination as before. Sanjna is appreciated, admired and adored by everyone.</p>
