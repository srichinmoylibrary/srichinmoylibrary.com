<p>GAUTAMI: O venerable lady, please wait. First tell me, has anybody died in your family?</p>

<p><em>(Gautami returns to the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>GAUTAMI: O Master, I have been to many places. Each family has lost someone. It seems that there is no family that has not suffered from death.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, you are right. No family on earth can say that death has not visited it. You are suffering, and like you many, many others are suffering. Many have suffered and many will suffer. Not just many, Gautami-all. Everyone has to suffer from death. We came from Light and we shall go back to Light.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: But, Father, he was my only child. How can I be consoled? Who will console me?</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Who will console you, Gautami? I will console you.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: Please console me, Father. You are the only one who can do it.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, as long as there is life there will also be death. Birth is bound to be followed by death, and death is bound to be followed by birth. Now, Gautami, I shall tell you the cause of sorrow. You have lost your only child. Your life is overwhelmed with sorrow. But the cause of your sorrow is not death. The cause of sorrow is desire. The day you conquer desire you conquer sorrow, too. Pray and meditate. You will conquer desire, and at that moment you will see that Light and Delight have become your constant friends.</p>
<p>GAUTAMI: O Sage, you are my Master. Today I know you. I have nobody on earth, nobody. I have no husband, I have no child-nobody but you. You are my All. You have consoled me. Now what I need from you is inner illumination. I shall dedicate my entire life to you unconditionally, wholeheartedly. It is through my dedicated service to you, Master, that I shall achieve my illumination.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Gautami, you are right, absolutely right. My child, your life is destined to enter into the realm of eternal Bliss. Meditate on God. Meditate on Truth. You will attain Peace, Joy and Bliss.</p>

<p><em>(King Prasenjit and Kshema.)</em></p>
<p>KING: Kshema, you are a great disciple of the Buddha. He is proud of your wisdom and I am fascinated by your spiritual insight. You have been at my palace for a few days, and you have given much wisdom to all the members of my royal family. I offer you my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: O King, I am so happy that I have been able to serve my Lord Buddha in your royal family.</p>
<p>KING: Kshema, tell me in a few words about Buddha's philosophy. You have to forgive me, but I do not have much time. My work in the Kingdom is simply killing me. I am overburdened, but I am deeply interested in Buddha's philosophy. Tell me in a few words.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Your Majesty, Buddha's teaching is very simple. He gives us the message of renunciation. He gives us the message of compassion. It is through renunciation and compassion that one can enter into Nirvana.</p>
<p>KING: One thing more, O Kshema.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Tell me.</p>
<p>KING: Why has Buddha not spoken about the soul? We Hindus all believe in the existence of the soul. Nothing can be done without the soul.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, he has not spoken about the soul, but he has spoken about the inner Light. What is that inner Light if not the soul? He has not used the term soul, but what he speaks of as the inner Light is nothing but the soul.</p>
<p>KING: He has not used the term God. We Hindus believe in God.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, he has not used the term God. But he has used the term Truth. What is Truth? Truth is God. God is Truth. The moment you realise the Highest Truth, you will realise God the infinite.</p>
<p>KING: It seems to me that Buddha has not spoken about life after death or about life after Nirvana.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True, Buddha has not spoken about life after death and life after Nirvana, but he has told us why death exists, and he has told us a little about Nirvana. He has given us the message of peace. Death exists when there is no peace. When you have peace, there is no death. As for the life after Nirvana, first we have to know what Nirvana is. Nirvana is infinite Delight. What can there be after infinite Delight?</p>
<p>KING: I don't understand your philosophy, Kshema.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: Let me try to make it clear to you. From your palace you can see the Ganges?</p>
<p>KING: Yes.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: You can see the sand on the bank of the Ganges. Now send whomever you want from your Kingdom to count the number of grains of sand. Or send somebody to measure the weight of the ocean. Can anybody from your Kingdom do it, your Majesty?</p>
<p>KING: I am sorry, I do not think anybody can count the number of grains of sand on the shore, or measure the weight of the ocean.</p>
<p>KSHEMA: True. Nobody can count the grains of sand on the bank of the Ganges or weigh the water in the ocean. Similarly, when you enter into Nirvana, there Bliss is infinite. It cannot be measured, weighed or counted. It is unfathomable. In that highest realm of Bliss we see the meeting place of existence and non-existence. There non-existence and existence are inseparable, indescribable.</p>

<p>DISCIPLE: O Lord, I wish to preach your teachings.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Certainly you may, but I would like to ask you a few questions first. I am sure you will be able to answer them.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: It is by your grace that I will be able to answer them.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Tell me, if somebody speaks ill of you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: My Lord, I shall keep silent.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Tell me, if he strikes you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I shall not raise my hands. I shall remain silent.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: If he wants to kill you, what will you do?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I shall keep silent. I know that death is inevitable. Everybody has to die. I shall also have to die one day. I shall not invoke death, and at the same time I shall not avoid death.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I am most pleased with your answers. You can preach my philosophy. You have my blessings. <em>(To all the disciples.)</em> Today I would like to walk in the forest. Those who want to follow me can come along.</p>

<p>ANGULIMAL: Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I have already stopped. It is you who have not stopped. You have killed hundreds of people. You wear a garland of thumbs around your neck. I have already stopped; I am stationed in the infinite Consciousness forever. But you are still roaming in the world of vital desires and trying to destroy the world. You have not yet come to a halt. In my case, I am already in the static silence of the Ineffable.</p>
<p><em>(Angulimal pulls out a knife and attempts to stab the Buddha, but the Buddha's Light captures him. He falls at the feet of the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: O Buddha, forgive me. Forgive my ignorance. Forgive me for what I have done to the world, and for what I was going to do right now to you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I have forgiven you. I have forgiven your past; I have forgiven your present.</p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: If it is true that you have forgiven my past and my present, then I wish you to prove it.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: How do you want me to prove it?</p>
<p>ANGULIMAL: Accept me as your disciple. If you accept me as your disciple, then I will believe that you have truly forgiven me, O Lord.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: You are my disciple, Angulimal. I accept you.</p>

<p>PRASENJIT: Master, I am so sorry that I have not been able to come to you for such a long time. My body remains in the palace, but my heart remains with you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Yes, my son, I know. Your heart of dedication and aspiration is here, but your physical body is needed by your Kingdom.</p>
<p>PRASENJIT: Master, the world is so corrupt. But your dream will one day be fulfilled, and then this world will have no suffering. One day the world will come to know that the cause of suffering is desire. Now people are still quarrelling, fighting and killing each other. I have some sad news for you: just last week a member of the royal family was stabbed to death by Angulimal, the dacoit. I am sure you have heard about Angulimal. He removed the right thumb of my relative and is now wearing it around his neck. How hard my soldiers are trying to capture him! But that criminal will never be caught. This is very sad news for me. Master, I pray to you to do something for my relative in the inner world.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I shall certainly do something for him.</p>
<p>PRASENJIT: I am sure, Master, that a day will come when even a murderer like Angulimal will be transformed by your Light and Compassion.</p>
<p><em>(Angulimal is now a disciple. He is seated among the other disciples, listening to this conversation. He is clean-shaven and wears the ordinary simple dress of a mendicant.)</em></p>
<p>BUDDHA: Prasenjit, Angulimal's transformation has already taken place.</p>
<p>PRASENJIT: How? When? Where?</p>
<p>BUDDHA <em>(pointing to Angulimal):</em> There is Angulimal.</p>

<p>UDAYAN: Magandiya, why do you always speak ill of Buddha?</p>
<p>MAGANDIYA: I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! He has insulted me! I must take revenge!</p>
<p>UDAYAN: How strange, how strange! Buddha, of all people, has insulted you? How? When?</p>
<p>MAGANDIYA: Before I married you I loved him most dearly. But he rejected my love brutally.</p>
<p>UDAYAN: I am surprised. I am sure he rejected your love gently and not brutally.</p>
<p>MAGANDIYA: Say whatever you want to say. To me Buddha is not a man of compassion. To me he is a man of cruelty. He creates frustration in others' hearts. He creates destruction in others' lives.</p>
<p>UDAYAN: But now that you have married me, are you not happy with me, my darling?</p>
<p>MAGANDIYA: Yes, I am, but an insult is an insult. Neither can I forget Buddha's insult nor can I forgive him.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Gateman.)</em></p>
<p>GATEMAN <em>(salutes the King and Queen):</em> Buddha and his disciples are anxious to see you, your Majesty.</p>
<p>UDAYAN: Please bring Buddha and his disciples in. I am so happy that on his own Buddha has come to my palace.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Gateman)</em></p>
<p>MAGANDIYA: Buddha! Buddha! Think of the devil and the devil appears. I can't stand Buddha. I can't stand him at all! You stay with your Buddha, but I am leaving!</p>
<p><em>(Exits angrily, breaking a vase)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter the Buddha and his disciples. Udayan offers him a soulful salutation.</em> )</p>
<p>UDAYAN: Buddha, please be seated on this thone.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: King Udayan, I prefer to sit on the floor. <em>(He sits.)</em></p>
<p>UDAYAN: If you sit on the floor, then my seat must also be on the floor, Lord Buddha. <em>(Sits.)</em></p>
<p>BUDDHA: My children, sit down. <em>(All the disciples sit.)</em> Where is the Queen?</p>
<p>UDAYAN: She is extremely busy. I am afraid she will not be able to join us.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I understand, King Udayan. For some time you will be occupied in listening to my spiritual teachings, and she will be occupied in insulting and cursing me.</p>
<p>UDAYAN: O Buddha, nobody can hide anything from you. You are all knowledge.</p>
<p><em>(The Buddha smiles.)</em></p>
<p>ANANDA: O Lord, why do you come to this Kingdom of Kaushambi where the Queen is so hostile to you? On our way to the palace so many people mocked you, insulted you and threatened you. You know perfectly well that it is the Queen who has been instigating them for the last few years to say and do all these undivine things to you.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, my most devoted disciple, tell me one thing: if we go to some other place and are insulted there, if we are criticised and threatened the same way we have been treated in this Kingdom, what would you suggest we do then?</p>
<p>ANANDA: Lord, we should immediately move to some other place.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: And in the new place also if we meet with the same problem, what should we do?</p>
<p>ANANDA: Then, Lord, we should go to some other place.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Ananda, if the same thing happens over and over everywhere we go, what will you do?</p>
<p>ANANDA: Each time we are criticised and insulted, I think we should to go a new place to observe our fate.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: O Ananda, most loving child, if we move from one place to another with the idea of finding a better place for manifesting the Truth, we shall never be successful. Truth has to be manifested here where we are, and not elsewhere. Once the Truth is established here, in the twinkling of an eye the Truth will be founded everywhere. Either here or nowhere the Truth must be established. Again and again I must tell you, Ananda, the Truth has to be seen, felt and realised within, and then manifested here on earth, wherever we are, and nowhere else.</p>

<p><em>(A most beautiful room. Enter Ajatashatru and Devadatta)</em></p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Ajatashatru, my friend, tell me frankly: are you jealous of anybody?</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: I don't think so.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: I am. I am so jealous of Buddha. But my jealousy does not help me at all. He now has thousands of disciples, while I have only a few. And even those few disciples are leaving me and going to him. I hate him! I want to kill him!</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Oh, now it seems to me that I am also jealous of someone.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Ah, you are also jealous of someone? Please tell me who.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: I am jealous of my father, the King. Everybody touches his feet; everybody adores him. He has so much power and wealth.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: You see, you have as much reason to be jealous of your father as I have to be jealous of Buddha. But we can easily solve your problem.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: If you solve my problem I will also try to solve your problem, Devadatta.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Ajatashatru, your father is old. This is the time for him to take rest and retire, but these old men never give way. Even until the last moment they want to enjoy the world, they want to lord it over the world. In every way you have surpassed your father. You have strength; you have power. Just throw the old man into prison and then you will become King. You can rule his Kingdom peacefully and bravely. Who is there to stop you? I shall help you.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: It is an excellent idea, an excellent idea! I shall do it. And when I become King, I promise you, Devadatta, I shall help you kill Buddha.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Be sure you don't eat your promise, Ajatashatru. Now you are the Prince, but you will soon be King. And it is on the strength of my advice that you will become King.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: I am not a mean fellow. I shall remember your help. I want to become King, and with your advice I shall fulfil my desire. Then I shall help you get rid of Buddha.</p>

<p><em>(Months later. King Ajatashatru is consulting his physician, Dr. Jaivaka.)</em></p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Why have I begun to suffer from all kinds of diseases and ailments since I have become King? When I was Prince I was always healthy and robust. But now I have lost all my health. Is it because of the pressure of my work?</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: No, King, it is not that which is causing your suffering.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Why, then, am I suffering?</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: Your disease, King, is psychological. You have an inner disease.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: What kind of inner disease? What do you mean by inner disease, Dr. Jaivaka? How will you cure me?</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: O King, I will not be able to cure you because your disease is not physical. Your disease is mental, psychological, spiritual. Only Buddha can cure you.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Buddha? Lord Buddha? Do you know that Devadatta and I are intimate friends, most intimate friends?</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: Yes, I know it. And I also know that Devadatta helped you become King.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Certainly he did. And I promised him that I would help him get rid of Buddha.</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: That also I have heard. I am fully aware of it.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Then why do you say that Buddha can cure me? That is impossible.</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: O King, do you want me to tell you the truth, or do you want me to flatter you? No ordinary doctor can cure you. Only Buddha the Doctor can cure you. Your heart is extremely pure. Your heart is feeling miserable for what you have done to your father and for what you have been doing to Buddha, the innocent Buddha, the Light of the world. Once you rolled a big stone toward him while he was meditating on his disciples, but it veered away before hitting him. On another occasion, you set a mad elephant to destroy him. But Buddha just looked at the elephant and it bowed down to him. Instigated by Devadatta, in various ways you have tried to kill him, but each time you have failed, and you will always fail. Buddha has realised the highest Truth. Your heart is crying for the highest Truth. This is your disease, the disease of your spiritual heart. If you really want to be cured, go to Buddha. He is the Divine Doctor, the Doctor Supreme. Nobody on earth but Buddha can cure you. He can and he will.</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: O human doctor, you are sending me to the Divine Doctor. I am grateful. My life of vital desire has ended. My life of soul's aspiration is beginning with your divine advice.</p>
<p>DR. JAIVAKA: Your soul is more than ready to accept the Buddha's Light. Buddha the infinite Light will transform Ajatashatru, the King of ignorance, into Ajatashatru, the Light of immortalising Bliss.</p>

<p><em>(The Buddha with hundreds of disciples. Enter King Ajatashatru. All the disciples are excited. Ajatashatru prostrates himself before the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: O Lord of the world, out of our stupendous ignorance my friend Devadatta and I tried to kill you several times, but we failed, badly failed. Today I am at your august feet, to be killed immediately by your wisdom-sun.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: O King...</p>
<p>AJATASHATRU: Master, I am not your King. You are the King of my heart and soul. You are the Lord of my heart and soul. I am your undeserving slave.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: You are not my slave, you are my son, my chosen son. My compassion-sun forgives your ignorance-night. My wisdom-sun illumines, liberates and immortalises your heart's cry.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Devadatta. Falls at the feet of the Buddha.)</em></p>
<p>DEVADATTA: Siddhartha, while we two were quite young I fought with you over the possession of a bird. The strength of my unruly, undivine vital had to surrender to the strength of your all-loving heart. You won the bird. I told you that one day with my vital love of power I would conquer your heart's power of love. Since then I have tried in hundreds of ways to humiliate you, to ruin your mission and to kill you, but I have failed. You forgave me then, O Siddhartha. Now, O Buddha, my shameless life desperately begs your forgiveness.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: Devadatta, forgiveness is granted.</p>
<p>DEVADATTA: O Buddha, if you have really forgiven this inhuman creature, then do me another favour out of your infinite bounty. Your heart of compassion took care of that innocent bird. Now I pray to you to take care of the crying, bleeding bird inside my heart. And also I pray to you to take care of its cage, this body.</p>
<p><em>(Devadatta sings three times.)</em></p>
