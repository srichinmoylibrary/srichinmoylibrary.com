<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To have perfect courage, try to remain always inside your soul. Now you will say that you do not know where your soul is. Then cry like a child; cry only for light, for light. Inside light there is always life. Light and life go together. The more light you can invoke and absorb, the more life-power enters into you. And when you have life, abundant life, you always have courage. If life is missing, if your life-power is less than somebody else's, you lack courage. But if your life-power is greater than somebody else's, you are not afraid of that person. If your life-power is strong, you will have perfect courage in dealing with situations, in dealing with things, in dealing with people.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to know whether you are perfect in your purity, for example, then you have to enter into your body-consciousness, vital-consciousness, mental-consciousness, heart-consciousness and psychic-consciousness. Take each one as a different room. As soon as you enter into one particular room, you have to see if that room is illumined or not. If you feel that it is illumined, that means that your purity is perfect in this room. And if there is no illumination, immediately you will say that your purity is not perfect. So enter into your body-room and see if there is light inside your body. If there is no light, feel that here your purity is imperfect. Then enter into your vital-room and your other rooms, and see if there is light in them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It takes place through individual progress. The world is composed of you, me and others. Now, if you become perfect and I become perfect and he becomes perfect, then world-perfection automatically dawns. World-perfection depends on each individual. When we become perfect, the world becomes perfect, for it is we-the human beings living in the world-who are responsible for what the world is. The world is only a vast plot of land where countless beings are staying. It is the inhabitants who can make it perfect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is all a matter of our sincerity. When sincerity knocks at our door, nothing is far; but as long as we remain insincere, everything is very far. When we sincerely study, we pass our examination. But when we don't study sincerely, it takes us many years to pass our examination. If we have a sincere inner cry, God-realisation does not remain a far cry. But if our inner cry is not sincere, God-realisation always remains a far cry. Sincerity travels along the straight path, the sunlit path, the short path, whereas the path of insincerity is dark, full of thorns, and without beginning or end.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is evolving and progressing. Once upon a time we were all animals, but from the animal kingdom we entered into the human kingdom. Human beings are more perfect than animals, although we are still half-animals. But one day we will become perfect. Likewise, those souls still in the animal kingdom will also someday take human incarnation, and eventually perfection will dawn for them, too.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank with you, it is not possible for all of us. I know the capacity of all the disciples. Why should I give you false hope by saying that all of you will be perfect in this life? But, at the same time, I am not throwing cold water on you or anybody else. I am saying that the real height of perfection — perfection of the human nature — cannot be reached by everyone in this life. Even here, among my disciples there are hardly ten people who are sincerely aspiring. How can I say that those who are not aspiring sincerely will be perfect? Now, as I said before, progress is a kind of perfection. If someone used to tell twenty lies a day and now tells ten lies, he has reached a kind of perfection. But when it is a matter of nature's perfection — mental purity, heart's sincerity and other divine qualities-how can I expect that kind of perfection from those who are not aspiring right now?</p>
<p>I am sorry. I wish you all could become perfect; I need your perfection badly, and I cry for it, but it is not possible in this incarnation, But it <em>will</em> be possible for some of you to achieve nature's perfection in your next incarnation, while for others it may take a few more incarnations. Perfection is inevitable. It is not that you will be perfect and your friends will remain imperfect. No! If the hour strikes for you today, you will become perfect today; if the hour strikes for somebody else tomorrow, he will become perfect at that time. We all abide in God's Eternal Time, so we do not have to worry. But we do have to try. Those who are aspiring will undoubtedly reach the highest sooner than those who are still sleeping.</p>
<p>I have seven hundred disciples. If all my disciples realised God in one incarnation, it would be a historical record. But God has not made me that lucky; I know my fate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the physical mind be perfected?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the physical mind be perfected?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are extremely wise, you will consider your physical mind as something out of the undivine, unlit past. When you think of what you did even ten years ago, you will shudder. If you feel that you don't want to keep any connection with your old life that existed only a few years ago, why should you want to keep a connection with something from two hundred or more years ago? If you have that kind of feeling, you will not pay any attention to the physical mind.</p>
<p>The physical mind is nothing but a monkey. If you want amusement from the monkey and spend some time with it, then you curse yourself for having wasted your precious time. But if you are wise, you don't pay any attention to the monkey, because you don't want to waste your time. If you pay attention to a monkey, it does all kinds of tricks. But if you don't pay attention to the monkey, it will go away in silence. It will be beneath its dignity even to bother you. If you look at a child, immediately it plays all kinds of tricks; but if you don't pay attention, immediately the child stops.</p>
<p>So, do not pay any attention to the physical mind. Think that only the heart exists. If you concentrate on your fingers, you find that you can concentrate successfully on only one finger at a time. Otherwise, if you try to focus your attention on two fingers, your concentration will be distracted. When you focus your concentration on the heart, you will not focus on the mind. Then, when you have established oneness with the heart, when you play tug-of-war with the mind, the side that has double strength will win. When you become one with your heart, you and your heart become like one against the mind. At that time you can challenge the physical mind and win. Then you can transform the mind. But when you remain alone and fight with your physical mind, you will not win. It is like a naughty boy. When you challenge him, he will bite you. But if you are strong, you can challenge him and he will not hurt you. Until your inner strength dawns, however, think that the physical mind does not exist and avoid it as much as possible. This is what you must do if you want to have perfection in the physical mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme's perfect warriors are those souls who have realised God and are now manifesting Him on earth, souls who have made a conscious promise to struggle for the Supreme and fight against ignorance, to enter into the world and perfect it. These souls are fulfilling the request of the Supreme to come to earth. They come down and see all the souls swimming in the sea of ignorance and lift these souls into the sea of Light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the same way, always in the same way. God the Mother and God the Father are not two separate beings. They are eternally one. Physical parents are two different individuals, but God the Mother and God the Father are one in essence and one in substance. They are one in their Dream-World, and they are one in their Reality-World. Mother and Father are like two eyes.

<p>Sri Chinmoy invited his disciples to ask him questions on perfection on two different occasions. This book consists of their questions and his answers. One group of questions was asked September 10, 1974 by the members of his New Jersey Centre. The other group was asked four days later, September 14, by the disciples of his Saturday Connecticut Centre.</p>
