<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. By this time I have read quite a few books and magazines on weightlifting and bodybuilding. The great champions are of the opinion that 70 or 75 per cent is mental preparation. They use the terms concentration, meditation and so forth. But in my case, 99 per cent is God's Grace and God's Compassion. For the remaining one per cent, three quarters is mental preparation and one quarter is physical preparation. Although I spend considerable time practising, I know how much God's Compassion acts in and through my weightlifting. So, in all sincerity, I must give at least 99 per cent of the credit to the Grace of my Inner Pilot, my Lord Supreme.</p>
<p>Many times when I look at the weight that I have lifted, my mind gets confused and bewildered. If you live in the mind, you will find only doubt, fear and confusion. But if you live in the heart and the soul, you will come to realise that everything is His Grace, His Compassion. I was not a weightlifter, I don't claim to be a weightlifter now and I will never claim to be one, although I do practise lifting weights. But I know it is not my own capacity that is lifting; it is my Beloved Supreme who is having an experience in and through my body, especially through my right arm.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to realise that the physical world is not the only world. The mental world is as real as the physical world. If you are having difficulties at a particular place, then you can go to another place. Who knows, that place may be more inspiring and encouraging. If you don't get inspiration to practise running on the running machine, then you can go outside where there are beautiful trees and fresh air. Then, once you get inspiration and joy from the outer world, from nature's beauty, you may be more inspired to practise on the running machine. Similarly, if you are not getting enough joy from your training on the physical plane, then you can enter into the inner world and meditate. On the mental plane first you imagine that you are lifting weights beyond your physical capacity. Then you can bring that mental capacity to the physical plane and turn your imagination into reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do the qualities of strength and power differ?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do the qualities of strength and power differ?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a great difference between power and strength. Strength is predominantly in the physical, with the physical and for the physical. Power has a higher and deeper source. But again when a seeker-lifter or bodybuilder invokes the higher power, it can come and act inside the physical and also for the physical. Strength is an outer achievement. Power is an inner achievement. If there is a tug-of-war between strength and power, power will always win, for the source of power is infinitely greater than the physical strength that any human being can have.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The athlete must sincerely <em>feel</em> that he has a soul and not just think so because someone has said it is true. Many people don't have direct access even to their heart, so how can they have access to their soul? It is through meditation, continuous and regular meditation, that we can feel the presence of the soul and eventually see the soul. But even if we do not see the soul, if we just feel the presence of the soul inside the depth of our heart, then gradually we can bring its light into the vital, mind and physical. But first we have to know that the soul exists. It must not be just mental belief but a real psychic experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They can all go together. Determination is on the physical plane, vital plane and mental plane. People may think that will power is in the mind, and to some extent this is true. But real will power comes from the soul, the God-representative on earth. Spiritual aspiration encompasses both determination and will power. On the one hand, we get determination and will power as a result of aspiration. On the other hand, birthless and deathless aspiration itself actually embodies the will power of the soul as well as the determination of the physical, mind and vital.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At times we ask if it is worth taking such trouble, time and concern. But we do everything in life in order to achieve satisfaction. We will not do anything unnecessary if we do not see or feel that there will be satisfaction at the end of our achievement. This satisfaction can be either fleeting or lasting. Satisfaction will be lasting only if we offer the results of whatever we do immediately to God. If we do not offer the results to God with a gratitude-heart, then the satisfaction that we get cannot remain permanent.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No! There are many who work hard and do heavy work, but if they are not doing it consciously, then they will not get the same result. Many can do physical work, but if they are not consciously trying to develop their strength or to feel the presence of a higher force in their action, then they will not get the same experience.</p>
<p>If both a seeker and a non-seeker have physical strength, the seeker will get more benefit when he works than the non-seeker, for he is doing it consciously. He tries to be constantly conscious of what he is doing and why he is doing it. A desire-man, a non-seeker, does not know why he is working and for what he is working. Because he lacks oneness-power with the Inner Pilot, he will not get the same sense of satisfaction as the one who is a seeker-weightlifter.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When one acquires physical strength, as a result of one's physical capacities there is every possibility that ego can come and take up its permanent abode inside the bodybuilder or the weightlifter. But if one acquires strength with the help of one's aspiration, and consciously feels that this strength is a result of the Grace from Above, then one will have only positive qualities such as peace, joy and oneness along with it. At that time, there will not be any kind of negative or superior feelings.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are a seeker, then it is absolutely possible. A seeker knows that he is nothing and he can do nothing unless and until God's Grace operates in and through him. He knows that he is not the doer. It is God, out of His infinite Compassion, who is acting in and through him. This moment God has given him the capacity to do something, and the next moment God can give the capacity to someone else. So if he knows that the capacity does not belong to him but that God, out of His Compassion and Oneness, has granted him the capacity to do something or become something special on the earth plane, then how can he become vain?</p>
