<p>I like the Chinmoy Beena more than any other instrument! That has become my most favourite. What I need — sweetness — it has. What I need — splendour — it has. I get such a sonorous feeling from that instrument.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar liked that instrument very much, so I played it for him. He immediately said that it had to be named “Chinmoy Beena.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Every morning, the very first thing I do is meditate, meditate. Then I play our Invocation. After “The Invocation” I play “My Lord Beloved Supreme.” Then I practise five or six instruments. First is the sitar, which I play for such a long time. Then I play the Chinese erhu. It melts my heart! Then I play a big, round, white Chinese instrument. After that I play the Chinmoy Beena, and some days the Western flute. How nicely I play the Western flute at home! Then, after a few hours, I play the cello.</p>
<p>Like that, daily I play seven to eight instruments at different hours. Three or four I play one after another, consecutively. I start with the sitar, and then, other instruments I play.</p>
<p>When I do cycling for half an hour, either I listen to my songs or to Tagore’s songs, or to other great performers. Half an hour passes by almost in the twinkling of an eye when I hear the music of superlative Indian singers. They literally melt my heart.</p>

<p>I started practising occultism not in India, but in some other country. As far as I can recollect, it was not in India. Before I studied occultism in India, I studied in another country. That country does not exist any more; it is extinct. That country was Atlantis.</p>
<p>In my previous incarnations, my occultism had a tremendous power-aspect. Now fire has become water. My occultism has become love-aspect and compassion-aspect. It has changed its form: love, compassion, forgiveness. Before, my occultism had a tremendously frightening aspect. Now, in this incarnation, my occultism has taken a different form.</p>
<p>Occultism does not mean only to threaten and frighten. It can also be used to raise the consciousness of someone who has perhaps descended lower than the lowest. As soon as I approach someone, I may lift him higher than the highest. That is also occult power. Occult power does not mean only to show fire!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mantu gives away my harmoniums</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Mantu gives away my harmoniums" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I used to buy harmoniums for my family. Three harmoniums my brother Mantu gave away!</p>
<p>The first harmonium Mantu gave away because somebody had an excellent singing voice, so Mantu felt that he deserved it. He came of a very poor family, and he could not afford a harmonium, so Mantu gave it to him. The second time, somebody had an excellent singing voice and he did not come from a poor family, but my brother felt that he needed a harmonium.</p>
<p>On the third occasion, Mantu gave a harmonium to somebody who had scored higher marks and transcended my record in the decathlon. He also had a good singing voice, and he did not have a harmonium. My brother gave the third harmonium to that fellow who had defeated me!</p>
<p>When I was doing sports, all the worries and anxieties fell upon my Mantu. On my sports day he had absolutely no peace of mind. On this occasion Mantu was so happy, not because that fellow had transcended my performance, but because he saw that the ashramites were progressing. When people progressed, whether it was his brother or somebody else, Mantu got such joy.</p>
<p>The third harmonium that Mantu gave away was really an excellent one. When Mantu told me, “He defeated you,” I said, “You suffered so much on my sports days!”</p>
<p>Mantu replied, “I want progress.” Our philosophy my brother was teaching me! “You want progress, you want progress. This fellow has done much better than you in the decathlon, so he deserves the third harmonium.”</p>
<p>I could not believe it! Mantu was giving me a lecture on progress, and he was the one who used to worry so much during my sports competitions.</p>
<p>During one of my visits, an ashramite said to me, “I taught you how to play the harmonium.” He taught me a quite a few songs — twenty or thirty, or even more. He said, “Now you have to give me absolutely the best harmonium available in Calcutta — the very best!”</p>
<p>I said that I would soon be leaving, so I gave him the money. The very best harmonium, according to him, he bought for himself.</p>
<p>We were like members of the same family, that gentleman and I. He had nobody. When he passed away, naturally the harmonium would come back to our family. But somebody took the harmonium away. My brother Mantu did not have the inclination to get it back. He said, “Since somebody has taken it, perhaps that person needed it.”</p>
<p>Somebody who was jealous of the person who had taken the harmonium away came to my brother and said, “Now take it back! You must get the harmonium.”</p>
<p>Mantu said, “It is too late. I cannot do this.”</p>
<p>So that man went and fought with the man who had taken the harmonium. He brought the harmonium back to my brother, because he was jealous of the person who had taken it away.</p>
<p>Again, the very best harmonium went to the person who had defeated me in the decathlon.</p>
<p>This is my brother Mantu!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Not humiliation, but illumination</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Not humiliation, but illumination" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>How Sri Krishna used to smash Arjuna’s pride! Arjuna was Sri Krishna’s dearest, dearest friend and disciple, but when necessity demanded, he used to smash Arjuna’s pride most powerfully.</p>
<p>Once Arjuna went to Sri Krishna’s place, Dwaraka. Sri Krishna was so happy to see Arjuna. They were chatting and chatting about everything — cabbages and kings.</p>
<p>A middle-aged brahmin came and pleaded with Sri Krishna to fulfil a strong desire of his. He and his wife had had very bad fortune. His wife would give birth to a baby and then, in a few hours, the baby would die. It had happened twice. He and his wife were so miserable. The brahmin came to Sri Krishna for the protection of his third baby. His wife would soon give birth to another baby, so he was begging Sri Krishna to save the baby this time.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna was only interested in talking about family affairs with Arjuna. Sri Krishna was not paying any attention to the Brahmin, but Arjuna felt very sad for this man. He was begging and begging Sri Krishna to help the man. Finally Arjuna said to the brahmin, “I am going to save your baby! I am coming to your place. As soon as the baby is born, I will protect him. Nobody will be able to kill him, nobody on earth! And if I cannot protect your son, I will kill myself.”</p>
<p>The brahmin said, “No, not that kind of promise! I cannot accept that kind of promise!”</p>
<p>But Arjuna said, “I know I will be able to protect your child. There will be no problem! I will come and protect him. But in case I cannot keep my promise, I will commit suicide by throwing myself into a burning fire.”</p>
<p>Again the brahmin said, “No, I cannot allow you to do this.”</p>
<p>Arjuna said, “I know what I am doing. I will be able to save your child. Do not worry!”</p>
<p>Sri Krishna gave his sanction, and he made the brahmin feel that Arjuna would be able to protect his child.</p>
<p>Arjuna had full confidence. He was a warrior; everywhere he could protect everybody! He could kill any enemy; he could protect anyone; he could do anything. Arjuna went with the brahmin to the brahmin’s place.</p>
<p>The following day the brahmin’s wife gave birth to a beautiful baby. After four or five hours, right in front of Arjuna, the little one died. The mother was crying, the father was crying, but the father was begging Arjuna not to take his life. Arjuna said, “No, I am a kshatriya! I want to, I have to kill myself. I have to keep my promise!” Although the brahmin had lost the child, the brahmin was begging Arjuna not to take his life, but Arjuna did not want to listen; he wanted to kill himself.</p>
<p>Arjuna was all ready; he was about to enter into the fire. Then who appeared? Sri Krishna appeared, and he stopped Arjuna. Arjuna said, “No, I must keep my promise.”</p>
<p>Sri Krishna said, “Yes, I want you to keep your promise, but let us do something first.”</p>
<p>Arjuna said, “I do not want to hear anything! I want to keep my promise.”</p>
<p>Sri Krishna said, “Can we not do something first? The Creator is Brahma. These three little ones are Brahma’s creation. Let us go and ask Brahma why it happened, why these newborn babies died. What was the reason? What has the brahmin done, or what has his wife done, or what is wrong with the family?”</p>
<p>Sri Krishna and Arjuna went to Brahma. Sri Krishna asked Brahma, “Please tell us, O Creator, why, why that poor brahmin family has to suffer? You created these children. Are you not responsible for the death of these babies? Please tell us the reason for their death.”</p>
<p>Brahma said, “The reason is very simple. Inwardly I have been begging you, Krishna, to come and visit me, with your dearest friend-disciple Arjuna, but you do not listen! You do not listen to me, and I have been dying to see you. I wanted you both to come here, so I created everything. There was no other way to bring you here. Only in this way was I able to bring you to my palace.”</p>
<p>They all talked and talked, and Brahma was so pleased. Then Brahma said, “Not only the last one, but the previous two children also I am sending back to the family.” One child was six years old, one was four years old, and one was a newborn baby. They all came back to that family.</p>
<p>This is our Indian mythological story! In order to see Sri Krishna, Brahma created this whole situation. The wife gave birth, but Brahma the Creator would not allow Vishnu to preserve the child. He would give life, and then he would take it away. Why? Only because Sri Krishna was not listening to Brahma’s request in the inner world. Although he could go to Sri Krishna in the subtle body, Brahma wanted to bring Sri Krishna to him, because Sri Krishna at that time was in the physical world. In order to see Sri Krishna and Arjuna, Brahma did all this.</p>
<p>From time to time I will tell you stories. I will be very happy if you can dramatise them. And you can embellish them in your own way, the way you have done during our Christmas Trips. I used to tell two-line jokes and you made them into two-page stories! You showed your extraordinary talents, and I was so proud of you.</p>
<p>These kinds of stories have their own inner significance. The inner significance you know. Sri Krishna’s absolutely dearest was Arjuna, but Sri Krishna wanted to smash Arjuna’s pride. He did not want Arjuna to have pride. For hours and hours Arjuna would pray to the Highest, with countless flowers. But so much pride entered into Arjuna! You know the famous story about Bhima. Bhima used to put his fingers to his third eye for two seconds. Like that, before he ate he used to invoke Lord Shiva. People were carrying carts of flowers for the worship of Lord Shiva, and Arjuna was praying for hours and hours. But Sri Krishna smashed Arjuna’s pride by appreciating Bhima. Not how many hours, but how sincerely and how devotedly we pray: that is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Many, many times Sri Krishna smashed Arjuna’s pride. Why? Because pride is our worst enemy. When our pride is smashed, it is not humiliation; it is illumination. The human in us will take it as humiliation when our pride is smashed into pieces. But the divine in us will take it as the most significant experience of illumination.</p>
<p>If somebody scolds you or insults you, do not take it as humiliation. If you dive deep within, you will find that it is not humiliation, but illumination. That illumination can come from a street beggar or from somebody else who appears to be infinitely inferior to you. God can give us illumination in His inimitable Way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Forever his inner guru</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Forever his inner guru" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Recently, somebody came to one of our Divine Enterprises. That person is no longer with us, but he played a role of utmost significance in our spiritual family. His sleepless self-giving to our manifestation and to the heart of our Centres I shall forever and forever treasure in the very depths of my gratitude-heart and my oneness-pride. In how many ways he served the Supreme in me, God alone knows.</p>
<p>This individual came to our Divine Enterprise with boundless enthusiasm, inspiration, joy and pride. While looking at one of my pictures, he said to the workers that I shall forever remain his inner Guru. I am the one who will remain his inner Guru, but he does not know who his outer Guru is.</p>
<p>We all have the same outer Guru: the mind. In our outer life we do not have to go very far to find our Guru. Our outer Guru, the mind, is omnipresent. But our heart’s Guru is our Lord Absolute Beloved Supreme. The Guru of our outer life, the mind, we must grab and forcefully place at the Feet of our inner Guru, who is none other than the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>The outer Guru, the mind, is giving us such painful experiences almost every day. The inner Guru, the Absolute Supreme, our Beloved Father, comes to us every day, every hour, every minute and every second. He pleads with us only to do one thing: to be one with His Will. He begs us to be one with His Will in our outer life and in our inner life as well. He pleads with us not to have our self-styled pride-will, but only to be one with His Will.</p>

<p>Yesterday Ila’s soul left the body. Since then, she and I have had quite a few conversations.</p>
<p>{{{fleuron}}}</p>
<p>Needless to say, Ila’s humorous aspect we have enjoyed immensely over the years. Outwardly she was an iron rod. Inwardly she was as soft as marshmallow. Her softness-heart was most remarkable, and her outer strictness was also most remarkable.</p>
<p>Let me say something about her humorous aspect. Ila’s soul was here for a long time. Only a minute ago she left. While you were singing the song <em>Jibaner bhar</em><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> so soulfully, she said to me, “My Guru, if this kind of appreciation and adulation your children are going to offer me, then I am ready to take birth every morning and die every evening!” This is Ila!</p>
<p>So many things I can tell about her. If I do so, it will be a huge book, with hundreds of pages. My soul, my heart and my life shall forever treasure her, for among those who think, feel and know who I truly am, perhaps she stands foremost. She continuously felt my inner heights, and for that I shall remain eternally, eternally grateful to her.</p>

<p>Tonight we shall have a performance. It will be a competition. Choose your partners wisely. Be merciless! If you think only of your friendship, then you will run into serious difficulty. Do not say, “I have to select my friend!” By selecting your friend as your teammate if you get no votes for your performance, then your friendship will be of no avail.</p>
<p>Please choose someone who is either of your own standard or of a higher standard. Friendship will not help you at this time. If you feel that you have to choose your friend, then you may be the loser. Keep your friendship inside your pocket, not in the competition.</p>
<p>At the Sri Aurobindo Ashram I saw what happened when people chose their teammates for friendship’s sake. In the tug-of-war you may select your friends, only to lose. As soon as the competition starts, you may be dragged away. That kind of friendship will prove to be nothing other than lack of wisdom.</p>

<p>Dear ones, Madal Circus gives me the utmost joy, purer than the purest joy. Our philosophy is progress, progress, progress, progress. Let us not change our philosophy! I am begging you to remain young, young, young. Only the young in spirit will realise God. Remember, no matter how old you are, whether you are sixty years old, seventy years old or an octogenarian, if you are not participating, then you are not doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Cast aside lethargy, cast aside unwillingness! I will never, never make fun of your performance — never. That I do not do. When there are clowns we laugh, but as far as serious performances are concerned, I do not expect you to be like a Chinese circus or another professional circus. Your standard will not be examined. Your willingness is the most essential thing. Your willingness is the only thing I need. I do not expect you to be acrobats or performers of the highest order. That I do not expect. What I expect from you is only willingness, willingness, willingness — cheerfulness and willingness. If you have cheerfulness and willingness, then you have given me everything, everything, everything.</p>
<p>If you have already performed and you have more energy at your disposal, then please perform again! If you feel that you can do something else, then please do it, by all means. Be a flowing river! I will be very happy.</p>

<p>In many countries we have been able to spread the Light of our Lord Supreme. At other times, the inner heart of a country we were able to conquer, but the outer life as such we could not fathom. Their inner heart, their love, their sweetness and their eagerness for a new life: those very things we were able to approach. The inner existence of the country we were able to approach, but the outer existence we could not approach, because they did not want anything. They felt they were self-sufficient. At times the inner heart is open, but the outer mind is stronger.</p>
<p>Everything happens at God’s choice Hour. At God’s choice Hour, the outer life of those countries also will open up. Right now they may think that something new will be harmful for them. I am sure one day that opinion will change.</p>
<p>We are all together. We belong to one family, so we cannot go on suspecting our brothers and sisters. Otherwise there will be no peace, no harmony. We shall accept the world with all its weaknesses. Everybody has weaknesses. In spite of our weaknesses, we love one another. The rest of the world is like our brothers and sisters. We stay together in spite of our weaknesses. We have come here to become happy. If we want to be happy, then we must have an open heart. Nobody can be happy without an open heart, an all-embracing heart.</p>
<p>A day will come when everyone will consciously feel the supreme necessity of a oneness-heart. But the inner heart, the heart that we need to pray to God, to meditate on God, to love God and serve God, that heart is beautiful, always beautiful.</p>

<p>Ustad Sultan Khan: where can one find such a kind, compassionate heart, such a loving heart?</p>
<p>Once when he was performing at the Royal Albert Hall, Yehudi Menuhin came up to him after he had played for ten minutes and said that he could not prevent himself from shedding tears. Such appreciation Ustad Sultan Khan has received for his music!</p>
<p>We became such close friends. So much affection, love and oneness he offered to me. He said that his wife had recently passed away, after a long illness. Then what did he say? When you have affection, love, sweetness and fondness, you can say anything you want to say! He was telling me that the God that he cannot see is not God for him, but the God that he can see is God for him. Then he said, “I am so happy. I have not seen God, but I have seen somebody who has seen God.” This was his feeling. The last thing he said to me was, “You are my God, for I can touch you, I can feel you. The God that I cannot see, wherever He is — how can He be my God? If I cannot touch Him, if I cannot feel him, then He cannot be my God. But the God whom I can touch, whom I can feel, He is my God. You are my God.”</p>
<p>When one has such affection, love, oneness and fondness, one can say anything he likes! My heart was so deeply moved.</p>
<p>When Ustad Sultan Khan started playing, right from the beginning his music was so soulful, so haunting. Some musicians take a long time to perform their real music. But Ustad Sultan Khan immediately, in just a few minutes’ time, brought us into the ocean of music. I am so grateful to him.</p>

<p>All of you kindly smile at me! Today is the day of smiling. Today I came to America, I came to the West, so I expect a smile from all of you. Smile, smile, smile! You have no idea how much strength I get from your smiles! If you do not smile at me, I feel that you weaken me. Since you are so kind to me, I expect only smiles and smiles from you.</p>
<p>It seems that some people have never learnt how to smile during their entire life. Once upon a time I was one of those! In my Ashram life I did not know how to smile. One picture was taken of my boss, Nolini, his wife and me — the three of us together. In that picture I smiled broadly. Nolini said that it was the first time he had seen me smiling!</p>
<p>I had two other names at the Ashram. One was “Fire.” Always people used to see fire inside me. And because of my delicate movement, people used to call me “Japanese Girl.” My movements were delicate, specially when I played ping-pong.</p>

<p>Some of my belongings I recently offered for the disciples to buy. Yesterday something remarkable happened. I was deeply, deeply moved.</p>
<p>Somebody bought one of my bags, and inside the bag was five hundred dollars! Neither the seller nor the buyer noticed the money while the bag was being sold. Soon the disciple who had bought the bag found the money and came back to the sale table to return it. There was no way for anyone to have known about this lost money.</p>
<p>I would like this visiting disciple to come and see me. I do not know her name and I do not know which Centre she belongs to. I am so proud of this disciple!</p>
<p>[Sri Chinmoy invited the disciple to come forward to have a photograph taken with him.]</p>
<p>I am very, very, very, very proud of you — a million, billion, trillion times proud of you, proud of you.</p>
<p>Alas, recently a visiting disciple’s wallet was stolen somewhere while he was in New York. Day and night always follow each other.</p>

<p>As you know, our family lived in a village. I have told you many, many times that before I used to go to town, I was in the habit of “stealing” money from my father’s pocket, almost every day. As a matter of fact, I did it every day, without fail! My father was so kind. He perhaps inwardly enjoyed my mischief. Never did he scold me. When he would go out of town, he took a different coat. He left his regular coat behind and put more money inside his pocket for me to take!</p>
<p>My mother was different. She worried all the time. She was so miserable that I had developed the unfortunate habit of taking my father’s money. My mother used to tell my father not to put money inside his pocket. But my father said, “No, no, no — I must continue.” My mother said, “I am worried. Today he will take from your pocket, and tomorrow the neighbours will make complaints!” Then my father said, “I know my son. He will not go that far. He will be confined to my pocket.”</p>
<p>My father’s prophecy was correct. He was indulgent to the extreme. That is my family story — father and son.</p>

<p>Some of the visiting disciples are so kind and so devoted to me. At times, their hearts compel them to go to the length of giving up their jobs so that they can be here for our Celebrations. Again, some disciples literally plead with their bosses to grant them a leave of absence. I have such good disciples!</p>
<p>The more you value me, the more I will be compelled to value you. It is mutual. The more we value our aspiration, the more God gets satisfaction. Similarly, the more you value my physical presence here on earth, the more you will get from me. If you value me, then you are bound to be valued by me.</p>
<p>Dear ones who come here from far-off lands, if other disciples can be a source of inspiration to you, I will be so proud of those disciples. Again, do not be doomed to disappointment if you see that some individuals are not aspiring. Please try to feel that you come here for me, for me. Your inspiration, your aspiration and your dedication must not suffer in the least if you see that some others are wanting in inspiration, aspiration and dedication. If you see disciples who are not aspiring, you must not think or feel even for a fleeting moment, “Oh, perhaps we shall also be the same eventually.” No, you do not have to become like that!</p>
<p>Ask your heart, and your heart will tell you that you come here for me and not for others. Keep your direct connection with me, with my soul, with my heart. I am sure I will not disappoint you, and I am sure you also will not disappoint me. Let us go forward, forward, forward with those who are ready, willing and eager to go forward.</p>
<p>Again, I wish to say that those who have lost their inspiration and aspiration can revive their inspiration and aspiration in the twinkling of an eye!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I will be successful in and through you</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="I will be successful in and through you" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>All the Centres can do one thing at the same time, and then see the results. It will be like putting out candles: here is one candle, there is another candle. Please think of something that you can do jointly. That will be so good! In addition to your specialities, whatever you are doing in your respective cities, if you can all do something at the same time, that will be very good.</p>
<p>I will be very happy if tomorrow you can give me ten significant items that you will undertake, or ten events. I will read them out. I am not going to blame you if you cannot succeed! I will never, never blame you. I will put my inspiration and my enthusiasm into all the items that you give me. But my inspiration, my aspiration and my enthusiasm will depend on your self-giving. I will be successful in and through you only on the strength of your self-giving.</p>
<p>Never think of who is doing what. Whatever you wish to do, just do it! If some people are not helping you or cooperating with you, then please be more determined to do it. Collectively you will try to do things, but if collectivity does not work, then go to individuality. If you work individually, the Centre itself will get the glory.</p>
<p>Talking has to surrender to acting. Action, action, action! If one individual comes forward with tremendous inspiration, aspiration and determination, I do not see why you cannot succeed.</p>
<p>Two evenings per week you have for your Centre meditations. Please think of the other five days. Each day do something — either the same thing on all the five days, or something different, in the evening. Evening is meant for spreading our light. At least two hours every evening you can spend.</p>
<p>It gives me such joy, unimaginable joy, when I get good news from your country or from any other country! Then my joy enters into you as strength, and I feel that each disciple can develop indomitable strength.</p>
<p>You can give concerts in various places. I am sure each Centre has at least three musicians. If you have three good singers or musicians, there will be a few others who will support you. You do not need twenty singers or musicians. Music can help! In some countries, young disciples go here and there, giving concerts. They may get thirty, forty or fifty people in the audience, and those people get tremendous joy. In that way you also can inspire people. It will make me so happy!</p>
<p>I really, really want your country to run fast, very fast. Receptivity is needed to receive my light, plus determination, determination, determination. Only one thing is needed in the outer world: determination. In the inner world, receptivity is needed. And that receptivity if you have, then I am inside your heart. You are welcoming me to be inside your heart. But again, in your outer life you need determination. Each and every individual needs determination.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that people can really be happy with their material life. No individual can be really happy unless inside him there is happiness. Inspire them! I am using the words “determination,” plus “readiness,” “willingness” and “eagerness.” Let us take the word “eagerness.” Readiness and willingness are first and second. But if there is eagerness, then how can you not inspire others? They will see the difference between the inner happiness, which is the real happiness, and the outer happiness.</p>
<p>You can have many projects. It is like a supermarket! Please keep your store full. You do not know which item an individual will like. If you sell only mangoes, some people may not be interested in mangoes. But if you have a large variety of items, it will be good. We have no idea which item will appeal to an individual. And again, as I said before, let all the Centres try to do one thing at the same time.</p>
<p>Please do not depend on disciples from other Centres. It may be impossible for them to come and help you. Your own Centre can have tremendous eagerness and determination.</p>
<p>Please start your journey with adamantine will-power. Then you are bound to succeed, you are bound to succeed! In August I would like to hear from each Centre what you have done. Each Centre will give me a report about what you have achieved. Each Centre has at least three or four solid members. If four solid members can work very, very hard, I do not know how it can be possible for you not to succeed. If those disciples work hard, very hard, then you are bound to succeed.</p>
