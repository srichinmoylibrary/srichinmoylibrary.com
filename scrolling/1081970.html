 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How does the Supreme appear to you, and what is the nature of your relationship to Him?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually I see the Supreme in the form of a golden Being, a most illumined and illumining Being. Here on earth, when we say that a child is extremely beautiful, we are judging his form. But I wish to say that the Supreme is infinitely more beautiful than any human child we can see. This is the way I see the Supreme when I converse with Him. It is this form that I am most fond of. At the same time, my Beloved may assume the formless form. Other spiritual Masters prefer other forms, and the Supreme appears before them in those forms. In this way He has let us exploit His Compassion.</p>
<p>Our relationship is that of Father and son. Out of His infinite Compassion, He has kindled the flames of aspiration in me. These flames climb high, higher, highest. My aspiration carries unconditional love devotion and surrender.</p>
<p>Familiarity breeds contempt in the human life, but in the spiritual life the familiarity between the seeker and the Supreme Pilot only increases in intensity and capacity. Familiarity cannot diminish the sweetness, love and concern that flows between the seeker and the Supreme. On the contrary, familiarity only increases these qualities. When I deal with the personal aspect of the Supreme, He increases my love, devotion and surrender. He makes me aware of what He eternally is. The more familiar we become with Him, the more we establish our oneness, our ever-fulfilling oneness with Him.</p>
<p>The personal aspect cannot create problems for the true seeker. When two people become close, it often does not last because they see weaknesses in each other. But the personal aspect of the Supreme knows what we are. He doesn’t think of us as imperfect; he takes us as His own infinite extension. He does not find fault with us either on the physical plane or on the psychic plane. It is He that is carrying us to the ever-transcending Perfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do you always speak of God in masculine term.?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do you always speak of God in masculine term.?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say “Father,” I do not exclude the Mother. God is both masculine and feminine. It is only that the term “Father” is more familiar in the Western world because the Christ always said “Father.” So I use the term Father because it is familiar to you. In the East we approach the feminine aspect quite often. We think of the Supreme Goddess, the Divine Mother. We have so many goddesses: Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Maheshwari, so it is very easy for us to think of God in feminine terms. But when I am with you, I have to use a term which is quite familiar to you, for I feel that this will make it easier for you to share my experiences. In truth, God is both masculine and feminine. Again, He is neither masculine nor feminine; He transcends both. He is what He eternally is: His Vision and His Reality. This Reality transcends both the masculine and the feminine form and, at the same time, it embodies both the masculine and the feminine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to some spiritual Masters, partial Avatars may feel at times that they have lost the reality which they have achieved. They may become inwardly disturbed, puzzled or afraid. Partial Avatars are not sure twenty-four hours a day of their inner divinity and inner achievements. In the inner world they at times feel that they are still searching for something and that they do not know inwardly who they are. But a full Avatar, someone who has absolutely the highest and fullest God-Realisation, will never be disturbed, puzzled or afraid. He constantly knows what is happening in the inner world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some Masters think that previous Avatars were not even Yogis. When Avatars see from Heaven that others are criticising them, then in the inner world they give serious punishment. If a Master unnecessarily criticises an Avatar, even if the Avatar being criticised does not have even twenty disciples, the cosmic law will take revenge.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will you explain the difference between an Avatar and a perfect Master?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will you explain the difference between an Avatar and a perfect Master?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An Avatar is a direct representative of the Supreme, a representative of the highest order. A perfect Master is also a representative of the Supreme. So if one is a real Avatar, then he is a perfect Master; and if he is a perfect Master of the very highest order, then he is also an Avatar.</p>
<p>Again, everybody’s Master has to be perfect to that particular seeker. Your Master is perfect to you and somebody else’s Master is perfect to him. Every Master should be claimed by his disciples as perfect. In that way only can he move himself forward. Otherwise, the disciple is not going to learn anything. Spirituality is not like a school lesson, where your teacher knows a little more than you. Although your geography teacher has many shortcomings, just because you have to study geography, you have to go and surrender to him and learn from him whatever he knows.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual life, when it is a matter of inner light, inner knowledge and inner wisdom, you have to feel that your Master is perfect. If you do not have the feeling that your Master is perfect, then you cannot go far. If from the very beginning you feel, “No, he knows only a little more than I do; he is not all perfect,” then you will not be able to progress. Disciples may think that someone else’s Master is absolutely useless; no harm. But each student should feel that his own Master is perfect for him. If the disciple does not see perfection in the Master, then how can he have perfection in his own life? If he sees the very thing that he wants manifested in someone else, then only will he strive to achieve it. But if he does not see the thing that he wants inside his Master then it is absurd for him to stay with the Master. He has to go to some other Master in order to see perfection.</p>
<p>In the case of an Avatar, it is a totally different matter. An Avatar is a direct descendant of God, so he has to be perfect in the absolute sense because he represents the Highest. Other Masters also are descendants of God, but you have to know that there is a great difference between a professor with a Ph.D. and a kindergarten teacher. Again, somebody will say that his Master is the highest Avatar, and then it may become a matter of quarrelling and fighting with others who also claim the same about their Masters. God alone knows who is an Avatar, who is a Yogi or who is a Swami. So no matter whose Master is an Avatar, or a Yogi or a perfect Master, the best thing is for each disciple to feel that his own Master is not only supposed to be perfect, but actually is perfect. If he does not have that kind of feeling, then he cannot make any substantial progress in the spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no significance. It is just that their hour may be the same. Suppose a great Avatar and another Master were born at the same moment. The astrologer may pay much attention to this. But if you inquire when this Avatar was born, you will see how many millions of cats were born at the same hour. So what does this signify? The Avatar and this other teacher who dies at the same time do not have any direct link. It is just that both their hours have come.</p>
<p>In the Cosmic Game, if two people are very spiritual, then their existence on earth together may have some significance. But if ordinary people, who are great in their own field, appear on the world scene at the same time, we cannot connect them with the spiritual Masters.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You get joy when I ask you to do something for me, to work for me. I get joy if I ask you to work for me and also if I ask you not to work. It is the same with the spiritual Masters. The Supreme asks some souls to work for Him on earth and some not to. Some souls, when they realise God, don’t want to manifest Divinity on earth and with God’s approval, they remain in the soul’s region. But those who want to manifest are like divine soldiers. They come down again and again and work for the Supreme for the transformation of humanity. For these souls, manifestation is always necessary. They feel that if manifestation doesn’t take place, then realisation is useless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The term “mystic” is very vague and complicated. All of the Spanish mystics were not realised. Many of them just entered into the mystical world for a period of time and wrote poetry and so on. But why ask about only the Spanish mystics? There were many mystics, but very few were realised. Again, when they became real God-lovers, real aspirants, at that time they were no longer mystics. From that point of view, I can say that a Yogi is infinitely superior to a mystic.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the difference between a mystical experience and God-realisation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God-realisation is infinitely higher than a mystical experience. In a mystical experience, you feel God’s Presence as something very sweet and delicate, but a mystical experience is not a permanent thing. As soon as you achieve a mystical experience, you can lose it. But God-realisation you cannot lose; it is permanent. Once you realise God, you never lose what you have.</p>
<p>Sometimes poets get mystical experiences. A poet can receive most sublime light and have a deep mystical experience. After completing his poems, however, the poet’s consciousness may become undivine and he then cannot maintain his mystical experience. A mystical experience is not a permanent experience. But if God-realisation takes place, then the mystical experience that one has will have abiding strength and can be permanent. So, there is a great difference between God-realisation and mystical experience. God-realisation is something infinite, eternal and real. Mystical experience is divine, but if mystical experiences do not come after God-realisation, they don’t last. A mystic is much inferior to a Yogi. There is no comparison. A Yogi constantly and unconditionally serves the Supreme and is continuously having God-experiences. A mystic is satisfied with experiences alone. He wants to enter into wisdom-light, but he does not care for the world. The Yogi cares for the world. The mystic wants only experience and wants it to lead to a final merging in God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sat-Chit-Ananda is a triple consciousness. Sat is existence, Chit is consciousness and Ananda is bliss. You can separate them if you want to and, at the same time, you can take them as one. If one achieves Existence, then inside Existence he has Consciousness itself. And if one has Consciousness, then Bliss is there. It is like an apartment or plot of land. You can give the plot of land one name or, if you want to divide it, each part of the plot can be called by a different name. But the reality of one is bound to be found in the other. They complement one another. So you can either separate them or keep them as one.</p>
<p>Sat-Chit-Ananda is the triple consciousness on the highest plane, and that plane is for the absolutely chosen few. To reach Sat-Chit-Ananda is a most difficult thing. Hardly twenty or thirty Masters have reached it and stayed at that plane, and hardly one or two can embody it. Some Masters have reached that plane and immediately came down because it was too high for them. It is much easier for people to reach the illumined mind or the Supermind, but Sat-Chit-Ananda is absolutely the highest. That consciousness is almost impossible to attain, even for the spiritual Masters.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not just any person can achieve nirvikalpa samadhi. But everyone has the opportunity. How can we all from the very beginning enter into nirvikalpa samadhi? We have to have a Guru. If one is sincere, one will get the Guru that one must get. It is our heart that tells. The mind misunderstands, but the heart knows whether we actually love someone or not. You can feel whether I have a connection with you in your heart. We cannot deceive our heart, although we can easily deceive our mind. As the mind deceives us, we are also clever and we are able to deceive our mind. But our heart never deceives us, so we must not deceive our heart.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that here in the West there is very little understanding of what a Guru is. I beg to be excused: I am not criticising the West. Far from it. I have great admiration for the West. But in the West the concept of Guru and chela (disciple), is very peculiar, very peculiar. Westerners don’t understand and they don’t want to understand. In the West, they think that they know better. But in the East, they feel the real oneness of these two souls. Here in the West, there is always the feeling of obligation. We have some obligation here and there, and always our obligation to the Guru comes last. First I have to go and see my friend; I have to do this and that. Here in the West they give not second importance but third importance to the Guru. But in the East it is not like that. In the East the Guru is of paramount importance. I am not saying this as a criticism; only I am stating that this is true.</p>
<p>Our Guru does not want anything from us. He wants only our absolute faith in him. If we have faith in our Guru, our Guru will do everything for us. If we have no faith, the poor Guru is at a loss. Why? Even if he wants to come and help the disciple whole-heartedly, the disciple will find some motive behind his efforts. He will think, “Master wants something more. He wants money from me. So that is why he is doing this.” But unsolicited the Guru comes to the disciple.</p>
<p>A real Guru does not care for your criticism or your opinion. By hook or by crook he will give His Light to you, just like a mother. When a child has a fever, the child does not want to take medicine. But the mother won’t listen to the child. If he is a real Guru, he will inwardly compel the disciple to take his Light. The Guru says, “I don’t want anything from you. I come here because I know what I can offer you and who I am for you.” The mother knows the connection between herself and the child, so she compels the child to take the necessary medicine. In the spiritual life also, the Guru inwardly compels the disciple. But outwardly he does not do anything, because the disciple’s outer mind may misunderstand him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the sincerity or the commitment of the disciple-seeker. His meditation must be most sincere, devoted and fulfilling. If one can meditate eight hours or twelve hours a day most devotedly and soulfully, then there is every possibility that that person can realise God in one short span of time, in one life. But if one meditates, say, for five minutes, even if it is most soulful, it may not be possible for that person to realise God in one lifetime. Still, it is more advisable to meditate one minute most sincerely and devotedly, than to meditate insincerely for ten hours.</p>
<p>Again, there is no hard and fast rule. God’s Grace is there. If you get a spiritual Master of the highest calibre, you don’t have to meditate twelve hours or sixteen hours a day. No, you just meditate an hour or two a day most devotedly, and with the Master’s grace, you can make the same progress as you would have done meditating twelve or sixteen hours a day without a Master.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two roads. One is the road of the mind; the other is the road of the heart. The road of the heart is a shortcut. If we walk along the mind-road, very often we will have doubts. We will doubt our own aspiration, we will doubt our own experiences and we will doubt our own feeling for God. This moment we love God, the next moment we may not love God because God has not fulfilled our desires. On the mind-path we are constantly contradicting our own thoughts. This moment we are saying that the path is very good and making progress; the next moment, when our desires are not fulfilled and doubts enter into us, our progress stops.</p>
<p>The other path is the path of the heart. Once we love God, we jump into the sea of Peace, Light and Bliss. Like a drop that enters into the mighty ocean, we feel that we have become the ocean itself. If we use the mind, it will immediately doubt: “I will be destroyed in such a vast ocean.” But the heart will say, “No, I will jump. If I jump I will not be lost. I will only become the Infinite.” The heart is a child and a child always has faith in his parents. So if we have a Master, we will have faith in him, and we also will have faith in God, for God always will be doing the best for us. This is what we feel if we follow the path of the heart. The path of the heart is the shortest path.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we best utilise our outer time to better our inner aspiration?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we best utilise our outer time to better our inner aspiration?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now our time means our earth-bound time. Now, we have to know why we have this limited time. Time and life came into existence together. They were very close to each other but unfortunately, when life started playing its role on earth, it became short-lived, and in the same way, time, being a friend of life, also became short-lived. Still, they know that their Source is the Eternal.</p>
<p>Now, you are a seeker. When you pray, concentrate and meditate, you have to feel that each second is infinitely more important than you thought it was previously, before you entered into the spiritual life. This second you can use either for meditation or for gossip or for cherishing impure and undivine thoughts. So when you consciously use time to do something divine, you are entering into the divine Time. Divine Time means timeless Time. When you are consciously thinking of something divine, immediately eternal time comes and shakes hands with you. Usually it does not stay in human beings, because when it stays, it has to stay in doubts, worries, anxieties, jealousies and so forth. But each moment, if you want to go upward through your aspiration, then the eternal Time becomes your friend, and then earth-bound time and eternal Time can become friends.</p>
<p>Now, when you have prayed, meditated and played your part in the spiritual life, if realisation is still a far cry, then you have not to be impatient or worried because God’s Hour has not yet struck. You have played your part and you have to feel that God has also played His part in and through you; you are the instrument. Even when your conscious mind wants to make you feel miserable that you have played your part and still God-realisation is a far cry, you have to feel that the Hour has not yet struck. Then you will not feel miserable.</p>
<p>Very often we think of a date and set a deadline for our realisation. We feel that on such and such a date, perhaps after ten, twenty, forty or fifty years, we shall realise God. Then, even though it is we who have imagined the date and have created this time limit for ourselves, when that time passes by and we have not had our realisation, we curse our aspiration and we curse God. But if we feel that God has to choose the Hour, then we can be happy.</p>
<p>So to come back to your question, if you aspire consciously, and if you consciously pray and meditate, you will see that you are using your time most divinely.</p>
