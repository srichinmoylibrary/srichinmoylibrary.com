<p>One day, after running eleven miles, I stopped to watch some children who were looking for something. One of them had dropped a coin, and they were all looking for it. So I also started looking. Finally, I found a dime and pointed it out to the child who had dropped it. He said, "Thanks a lot." Then he gave me a smile and I gave him a smile.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after I had run about three and a half miles, I stopped for a couple of seconds while running up a hill. At that time another runner — a man of about my age — passed me and said, "Come on, you can make it. You are not that old." So I started running and then I passed him. He gave me a broad smile and said, "I told you so." He was very happy that he had inspired me. Then I made a right turn and he made a left turn and we parted.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was running at five in the morning near Thomas Edison High School. At a little traffic island I had to stop for the cars. All of a sudden a car came right into the island, stopping just thirty metres from me. The man seemed drunk. If it had not been for the trees, it would have been a very close call.</p>

<p>As I made a left turn off 150th Street, I noticed an old man on the corner, looking at me. I looked at him and said, "Good morning." In a few seconds he felt inspired to also start running. I said to myself, "O God, what is he doing?"</p>
<p>As he approached me, the time came for me to show off. I ran fast, but then I cursed myself. Usually, if people pass by me, I say, "Oh, perhaps he is doing only one or two miles and I am doing eight or nine." This time I felt sorry for my stupidity.</p>
<p>For 200 metres we ran together. Then he made a right turn and I made a left turn.</p>
