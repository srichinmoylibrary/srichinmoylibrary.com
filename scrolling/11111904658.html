<p>One day, after running eleven miles, I stopped to watch some children who were looking for something. One of them had dropped a coin, and they were all looking for it. So I also started looking. Finally, I found a dime and pointed it out to the child who had dropped it. He said, "Thanks a lot." Then he gave me a smile and I gave him a smile.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after I had run about three and a half miles, I stopped for a couple of seconds while running up a hill. At that time another runner â€” a man of about my age â€” passed me and said, "Come on, you can make it. You are not that old." So I started running and then I passed him. He gave me a broad smile and said, "I told you so." He was very happy that he had inspired me. Then I made a right turn and he made a left turn and we parted.</p>

<p>As he approached me, the time came for me to show off. I ran fast, but then I cursed myself. Usually, if people pass by me, I say, "Oh, perhaps he is doing only one or two miles and I am doing eight or nine." This time I felt sorry for my stupidity.</p>
