 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What are the first steps in entering the spiritual life?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First, one has to feel the necessity of the inner life. A person must feel totally dissatisfied with the outer life and the outer world. He also has to feel that there is another world, another life, and that is the inner world, the inner life. He has to feel that if he is secure and satisfied in the inner world, only then will he have security and satisfaction in the outer world.</p>
<p>It will be easier for you to make the first step when you know what you are going to get form the spiritual life. The spiritual life will give you inner peace, joy and bliss in abundant measure. People cry for name, fame, earthly achievement, success and progress and so many things. They are right in their own way. But you should start crying inwardly from this moment on for joy, peace of mind and the awakening of your inner consciousness.</p>
<p>We have, all of us, two different types of consciousness: one is finite, which is earthbound; the other is infinite. This infinite Consciousness, this universal Consciousness is within us. So early in the morning, go deep within. Focus your concentration on your heart and try to feel there the existence of a child crying within you. This is your soul. Then consciously try to identify with this inner being, which is absolutely yours. When you are identified with this inner being, you will see the inner being is crying for you, has been crying for you and will cry for you for eternity unless and until you have become inseparably one with the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>So, early in the morning for five or ten minutes, please try to go deep within with your conscious mind or with your pure, sincere heart and feel the necessity of the inner life. Once you feel the necessity, your inner being will guide you, mould you and shape you along the path. Finally, you can march and run along the path. If you can go deep within and sow the seed of aspiration with your inner cry, then sooner or later you are bound to get a bumper crop.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What us the first step toward realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What us the first step toward realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start with, we have to study spiritual books, spiritual scriptures, for self-elevation. In the beginning if we study a few scriptures like the Bible and other books, then we will get deep inspiration. We may feel that this inspiration is not enough to transform our life within and without. So then we have to mix with spiritual people — those who we feel are already awakened and aspiring, those who are walking along the spiritual path and marching toward the destined Goal.</p>
<p>It may happen that we will feel that the company of spiritual people is not enough. We are mixing with them, joining in their soulful talk; but the need of our soul impels us to go further. Our cry, inner cry, is so intense that it compels us to look for a spiritual Master. If we get a real spiritual Master, one who is meant for us, who can see our soul, then we are totally safe. There are many, many Masters who may not satisfy our soul's needs. There are many, many universities. We study at a particular university because it fulfils our needs. Similarly, though there are many spiritual teachers, only one can completely satisfy our needs.</p>
<p>We will have infinite confidence in our particular teacher. When we meet this particular teacher in whom we have absolute confidence, then we have to ask him for a specific meditation. Each seeker needs a specific meditation from his spiritual Master. Aspirants who have launched into the spiritual path cannot give a meditation. But a real spiritual Master, one who has realised God Himself and who can enter into our soul and find our souls' qualities, propensities and inclinations, is in a position to give us a specific meditation and guide us in our spiritual life.</p>
<p>When we have a Master, when we are in his boat, we are safe. Everybody will reach the Goal sooner or later, but if we consciously and intensely aspire, we will undoubtedly reach the Goal sooner than those who are still asleep.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot communicate with others. Why? Because we cannot communicate with our soul or with our Inner Pilot. It is not in speech that we commune with our soul's light. We can commune with our soul through meditation. When we live in the sea of Light or in our soul's concern, it is all God and there is no necessity for outer communication. In the full perspective, we will remain unsuccessful in our outer communication if we do not begin with God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Potentiality everybody has. God is like a potter. His material is always the same; but when He shapes it, it becomes so beautiful. Although one pot may not be as beautiful as another, the essence of both is the same: clay. Similarly, in spirit we are all one. But while God is moulding a soul we may say, "Why has He moulded that one so attractively, while this other one is so much less beautiful?" We have to know that it is entirely up to Him to decide how He wants to shape each soul. My essence, your essence, everybody's essence is the same. But in a particular soul we may notice something called conscious aspiration. It was destined that each person should have very limited freedom. That freedom started right at the beginning of creation, when the individual souls came into existence. Now we see that somebody has used his freedom for the spiritual life, somebody else has used it for music, somebody else for poetry. The original essence is the same, the spirit is the same, but the manifestation is different.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually it is step by step. First we make one dollar, then two dollars, then one million dollars. But again, God, being omnipotent, can give someone liberation all at once if He wants to. There is no hard and fast rule, but in ninety-nine percent of the cases you have to do it step by step. First you get partial liberation and then full liberation.</p>
<p>If God wants, He can give liberation all at once. Usually God does not want to break His cosmic Law by giving liberation to someone who has not worked for it. But if God wants to have that experience through a particular individual, He can make the person receptive.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the practical level, do not expect anything from others on the physical plane. Just give and give and give, like a mother who gives everything to her child thinking that the child is not in a position to give her anything in return. Do not expect anything from the world; only love the world and offer your capacity, your inner wealth, your joy. Everything that you have, give to the world unconditionally. If we expect anything from the world, then we will feel miserable because the world does not understand us, the world does not care for us. So if we can do anything unconditionally, then we will have peace of mind. This is one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to meditate on the heart, where there is constant joy, constant love. At that time we will not cry for appreciation from others. We will all the time depend on our inner Source, where there is infinite Joy, infinite Love, infinite Peace. The best thing is to meditate on the heart. This is the second way, which is most effective.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can achieve constant progress in our day-to-day life only when we dare to say that the Supreme is ours. God-realisation is our birthright. Each aspiring soul must feel the Supreme as his very own. Then alone can he make infinite progress in his life here on earth.</p>
<p>How is it that we cannot make satisfactory progress? We cannot make satisfactory progress primarily because of our doubt. When we see our future, doubt tells us that we can never be so good, so devoted, so self-giving to the Supreme. When we look backwards, doubt immediately tells us that once upon a time we were not so bad; we were not so hostile or undivine as we think. Doubt will never tell us the truth about where we stand or what we stand for. When we spontaneously, consciously, deliberately and soulfully cast aside doubt from our existence, God-realisation becomes easy.</p>
<p>And how can we cast aside this doubt, this slow poison from our existence? We can do so only on the strength of our constant aspiration, flowing determination, total self-giving and love, devotion and surrender. I wish all of you to know the actual significance of these soulful, divinely intoxicating words: love, devotion and surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we remain more conscious in our life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we remain more conscious in our life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can be more conscious in our outer life only when we feel that the outer life has no existence without the inner life, the life of inner light. The inner life is the foundation. If the foundation is not solid, then the superstructure cannot be strong and permanent. Early in the morning when the day dawns, we have to feel that God comes first in our life. For ten minutes or fifteen minutes or half an hour, we have to invoke God's Presence. The Presence of God is constant everywhere, but if we feel that God is someone else, somewhere else, then we have to invoke Him from the highest Heaven, from out of the blue. If we feel that God is already within us but lying so deep that we cannot see or feel Him, then we have to pray to God to come to the fore. Either a seeker has to invoke God from without or he has to bring God's inner Presence to the fore. Then, when he feels God's Presence, he feels that his life is secure, for God's Presence means God's infinite Power, infinite Light.</p>
<p>In order to be conscious during our day-to-day activities, we have to feel that each action we perform is equally important in God's Eyes. We have to act with a surrendered attitude, with pure thoughts and an illumined mind. If we act to satisfy our ego, vanity or pride, then we can never be conscious of the divinity within us. When we are not conscious of the divinity within, then we cannot be conscious of our true existence in our outer life. God has a special mission for each of us and our soul has taken incarnation to manifest this mission. We have to feel that we have a divine purpose, a divine goal. Our outer life and our inner life must become one.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know how far we have walked along the path of spirituality, that is to say, our own development. A person eventually can become an expert in his career. This doesn't mean that someone can become a great singer overnight. It takes time for him to become a good singer, or for a dancer to dance well, to learn to do the steps in perfect order. Similarly, it takes time for a seeker to become expert in his field.</p>
<p>When someone is really a great seeker, very advanced in the spiritual life, he automatically prays and meditates during the very early morning and in the evening. In the beginning, perhaps he started with only five minutes of meditation in the morning. Then he began to sit for half an hour, an hour, two hours. If someone can meditate for two hours at a stretch with perfect equanimity, without losing his mental balance, then naturally he will grow inner strength, light and power.</p>
<p>We cannot meditate twenty-four hours a day. We have to go to work or to school. But while answering our boss's questions, or our professor's questions, we can feel the living presence of our inner being. We can feel the presence of a divine child, a divine presence guiding us. This inner feeling is surcharged with Light, Peace and Bliss. How can we develop this inner growth? It cannot happen overnight; nobody has done it. It is like a muscle. To develop it we must take exercises daily. In the spiritual life also if we practise daily, regularly, soulfully, we are bound to develop this inner capacity. Even if we speak about mundane things, we will not lose the inner wealth that we accumulated during our meditation early in the morning.</p>
<p>Everything depends on a seeker's achievement. If I have money and I want to give it, I can give it to you. But if I do not have any money, in spite of my best intentions I cannot give it to you. The same is true of spiritual wealth. If we are in the office and the workers are not at all spiritual, we could become a victim of their merciless treatment. But if our inner being supplies us with inner peace and joy, we will be able to swallow their undivine behaviour. Things that we have really achieved in the spiritual life we can use. If our inner being has accumulated Peace, Light, Bliss and Power, then we can bring them forward at any time.</p>

Either he has to follow the spiritual path in the way that path has to be followed, or he has to leave that spiritual path because it is not meant for him. Spirituality is meant for those who feel the necessity of God-realisation, who feel the necessity of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I always say that past is dust, past is dust. And I wish to repeat the message that past is dust. Let the past be buried in oblivion. The past has not given any of us realisation, God-realisation. It is the present that will give to each of us our Self-realisation. It is the message of the golden tomorrow that will enter into the present and change our lives within and without. Each new year signifies progress and there is no end to this progress. Our journey is eternal. Our Goal is the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Love. Whom are you loving? You are loving the Supreme in each individual. When you love the body, you bind. When you love the soul, you free yourself. It is the soul in the individual, it is the Supreme in each human being that you love. Nothing can be greater than love. God is great only because He is infinite Love. If one wants to define God, one can define Him in millions of ways; but I wish to tell you that no definition of God can be as adequate as saying, "God is all Love." If fear comes into our mind when we say 'God', then we are millions and billions of miles away from God. When we repeat the name of God, if love comes to the fore, then our prayers, our concentration, our meditation and our contemplation are genuine</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know what Yoga means. Yoga is a Sanskrit word that means union with God. If we want to realise God, aspiration, self-discipline, self-control, prayer, concentration, meditation and contemplation are all of paramount importance. Yoga comprises all of these divine qualities. Again, aspiration is nobody's monopoly; it is not limited or confined to anybody. Everybody can aspire if he wants to.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sri Chinmoy, what path of Yoga is your particular teaching? Is it Bhakti Yoga?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sri Chinmoy, what path of Yoga is your particular teaching? Is it Bhakti Yoga?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have asked a very interesting question. As you know, there are three principal paths: Bhakti, Jnana and Karma Yoga. Again, in Jnana Yoga, the branch that deals with mysticism is called Raja Yoga. Now if people say that my path is all Bhakti Yoga, then it is a mistake, because my path includes all other paths. It includes Karma Yoga, selfless service. All my disciples are doing selfless service. It includes Jnana Yoga: while my disciples are studying my writings, they are doing Jnana Yoga. What is meant by Jnana Yoga? Wisdom. What is more valuable for a man to know than the Highest? The Highest, I say, is love. If one knows this very fact that God is all Love, is this not the supreme knowledge? The supreme knowledge is that God is all Love. The deeper we go, the clearer it becomes. Through love we can know the supreme secret, which is God.</p>
<p>Just because we say there are three rungs in our spiritual ladder — love, devotion and surrender — people immediately associate my path with Bhakti Yoga. But in India it is not like that. In India fortunately when we say Bhakti Yoga it means all devotion, devotion, devotion. We don't care for any kind of mental illumination or mental awakening. In Bhakti one wants only to devote oneself with utmost intensity and not to cry for mental and intellectual light. But if we really love God, if we really dedicate ourselves to God, then the mind is bound to be illumined. We are not going to reject the mind; we have not come into the world to reject anything. We have not come into the world to throw anything into the dustbin. But we have to transform and illumine the mind. How do we do that? We illumine it with light. This room is all darkness at night, but with electricity we illumine it. Similarly, the mind is a dark room right now, absolutely dark. When we bring our inner light to the fore and then enter into the mind, the mind becomes all light; it is illumined. When this path of love, devotion and surrender is properly followed, it encompasses other paths as well. But just because we speak of love, people immediately take this as the path of Bhakti. Our path is not Bhakti Yoga. But it is nearer to Bhakti Yoga than to other Yogas. This path has illumination because it says that when we know, through some means, who is our Dearest, our Sweetest, our most Affectionate, our All-fulfilling, then naturally we will have wisdom. Wisdom is Jnana Yoga. Now, how do we combine all these paths? We do it with aspiration and dedication. Karma Yoga is there, in our selfless service. With our aspiration we try to know the highest within ourselves. Once we reach the Goal, which is inner awakening, we get wisdom which is the highest Jnana Yoga. So, when somebody says that our path is nearer, closer, to Bhakti Yoga than other paths, it is true. But to say that it is all Bhakti Yoga would be a mistake.</p>
