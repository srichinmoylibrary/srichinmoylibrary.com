<p><em>(A King and Hanuman.)</em></p>
<p>KING: Hanuman, I have heard much about your strength and your sacrifice. It was you who discovered Sita in Lanka. It was you who took Rama's message to Sita and Sita's message to Rama. It was you who enabled Rama to conquer and kill Ravana. Without you Rama could not have won the victory.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: O King, I don't want you to utter falsehoods. Rama is God. It was most kind of him to appoint me as his messenger. It was most kind of him to ask me to fight for him. But Rama did not need my help. Rama does not need anybody's help. He could easily have conquered Ravana himself. He can protect himself He is all power. He can conquer the whole world at his sweet will.</p>
<p>KING: I deeply admire your heart's nobility.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I shall also deeply admire you when you speak the truth. It is Rama who can do everything. Rama is all-powerful.</p>
<p>KING: Yes, your Rama is all-powerful. He is everything. Are you happy now?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Yes, I am happy. I am happy. When you say this, I become happy.</p>
<p>KING: I have a gift for you, Hanuman, a most precious gift.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Thank you.</p>
<p>KING <em>(holds out a pendant):</em> I wish to place it around your neck myself. I am pleased with your strength, proud of your love for Rama and proud of your sacrifice.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: O King, my sacrifice for whom? If you say, "For Rama," I shall not accept your gift. I shall return it immediately. I made no sacrifice for Rama. His very existence on earth is the supreme sacrifice for me and for earth.</p>
<p>KING <em>(places pendant around Hanuman's neck):</em> This pendant looks wonderful on you. I am so happy to see you wearing it.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: It certainly does. I deeply thank you for this necklace.</p>
<p><em>(Hanuman starts fondling the locket. Finally he takes the necklace off and starts to break open the locket.)</em></p>
<p>KING: Hanuman, what are you doing? You are a fool! That is such a precious locket! Can't you see the diamonds on it?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: But I want to see what is inside it. <em>(Breaks it open.)</em> Ah, nothing! <em>(Throws it away.)</em></p>
<p>KING: What a fool! What am I going to do with such a fool? You have no sense! Why did you break the locket? Why did you throw it away?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I wanted to see if there was a picture of Rama inside, but there was no picture. I did not see anything of Rama inside the locket. So why do I need it? I only need the things that have Rama in them. Without Rama I do not exist. No matter how expensive, how valuable your locket is to you, it is of no value to me. With Rama, everything is most precious to me. Without Rama, everything is useless to me.</p>
<p><em>(Hanuman sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Tumi shudhu bandhu arnar</em><br /><em>Tumi amar pran</em><br /><em>Baul haye desh bideshe</em><br /><em>Gahi jena bhalobese</em><br /><em>Jiban bhare tomar jaya gan</em><br /><em>Tumi shudhu bandbu amar</em><br /><em>Tumi amar pran</em><br /></p>

<p>You are my only Friend,<br /> You are my Life.<br /> Like a divine mendicant, from<br /> one country to another<br /> May I sing a song of You<br /> With all my love.<br /> May I sing the Song of<br /> Your Victory all my life.</p>

<p>HANUMAN: King, since you do not care for Rama, I cannot waste one minute more of my precious time here. Good-bye.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Hanuman)</em></p>
<p>KING: Hanuman's strength is unparalleled, but his blind and stupid faith in Rama is also unparalleled. In God's Creation, it seems perfection will never dawn.</p>

<p><em>(Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and a vast audience. Sita is weeping with joy.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Sita, my heart is overflowing with joy to see you again. But, Sita, to me <em>Dharma,</em> Divine Justice, is more important than my concern for you. You have stayed at the wicked Ravana's palace for several months. I am sure he has cast his lustful gaze on you. I am sure you are impure. My subjects will misunderstand me if I accept you now. Therefore, I am compelled to disown you. You must leave. You may go wherever you want to. Even if you want to have somebody else as the partner of your life, I will have no objection.</p>
<p><em>(Sita's tears become tears of grief.)</em></p>
<p>SITA: You speak like an ordinary human being, Rama. I thought that you were great, really great, but now I think that you are worse than any human being on earth. Can't you see with your occult vision whether or not I have lived an impure life at Ravana's palace? He tempted me with his wealth. He tried to force me to be his, but my inner strength protected and saved me. I wanted only you, and I still want only you, but now you discard me like a filthy rag. I am prepared to leave you, but before I leave, I wish to prove to you that I am Purity itself. I shall consign my body to fire and you will see what happens to me. <em>(To Lakshmana.)</em> Lakshmana, with all your heart's magnanimity you have helped me millions of times. You have listened to me millions of times. You have always considered me as your mother. Listen then to one final request. Please light a blazing fire for me. This is my last request, my last prayer to you.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Mother, not a prayer, not a request, but a fatal command. Rama, what am I going to do now?</p>
<p>RAMA: You have always pleased her. Now please her this time, too.</p>
<p>SITA: I know that fire is the cosmic Reality and Rama is the cosmic Reality. If I come out of fire unburned, then the world will know that I was pure — Purity itself. And if I do not come out of the fire, then I will enter into the cosmic Reality, which is my Rama.</p>

<p><em>(Lakshmana has lighted a blazing fire in the presence of a large audience.)</em></p>
<p>SITA: O Fire God, my husband Rama has every right to test me, and I have every right to prove to him that I was pure, I am pure and I forever shall remain pure. If I fail in this test, I shall go to my Divine Rama in Heaven. If I pass, I shall remain with my human Rama here on earth.</p>
<p><em>(Site walks slowly, steadily through the leaping flames and comes back to Rama. The all-consuming fire could do nothing to her. Her whole face is aglow. Rama receives Sita with all his love.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: My Sita, the fire ordeal is over. The world now knows that you are Purity itself. You had the heart to prove yourself to my subjects. One part of my being wanted to please my subjects at your expense, with your sacrifice. It felt that the whole object of my stay on earth was to please them. Another part, which is divine, knew well that you were pure and felt that this was doing an injustice to you. But you and I are one. You have proved it. With your sacrifice you have shown your greatness before my subjects, and since we are one, you have made me great, also. What you have done for me and what we are doing for my subjects is right.</p>
<p>SITA: My Lord, you are right. You are always right. This existence of mine is only to please you, to prove to the world that I am only for you and that the illumination of the world depends only on your compassionate wisdom.</p>
<p><em>(Sita sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Saphalhbabe swapan amar saphal habe</em><br /><em>Samarpaner atma-hutir mahotsabe</em><br /><em>Tomar hasi tomar banshi</em><br /><em>Bijay ketan amar chetan</em><br /><em>Amar bhabe nachbe jani</em><br /><em>Amar bhabe</em></p>

<p>My dream will be fulfilled<br /> In the great festival of my surrender's<br /> consecration-fire.<br /> Your Smile, Your Flute,<br /> Your Banner, Your Consciousness-Light,<br /> In my world shall dance,<br /> I know, I know.</p>

<p><em>(Hanuman is at the bank of a river. It is raining heavily. A man passing by comes up to him.)</em></p>
<p>MAN: Ah, I have found someone who is also suffering from the rain. I thought that I would find nobody here. I came for the ferry, but no boatman is willing to carry me across to the other shore. All are afraid of this storm.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I am not afraid of the storm. I am just thinking of my Lord Rama.</p>
<p>MAN: Hanuman! I have heard much about you. What has Rama ever done for you?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Be quiet. What has Rama <em>not</em> done for me? Is there anything that he has not done for me? Or is there anything that he will not do for me? He has done everything and he will do everything for me. I have done hardly anything for him.</p>
<p>MAN: You have done so many things for him, Hanuman.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: True, but I still feel that I can please him much more than I have already pleased him.</p>
<p>MAN: O Hanuman, you are the incarnation of humility.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I am the incarnation of sincerity. But if you say I am the incarnation of humility, I don't accept that. I <em>want</em> to be the incarnation of humility. How I wish I could do something really great for my Rama! It seems the rain will never stop. But I shall go to the other side,</p>
<p><em>(Hanuman starts walking on the water.)</em></p>
<p>MAN: Hanuman, Hanuman!</p>
<p>HANUMAN <em>(coming back):</em> What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>MAN: I want to go with you.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: You want to go with me? Then come along.</p>
<p>MAN: But I am afraid.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Don't be afraid. Do you have a pencil?</p>
<p>MAN: Yes.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: And a piece of paper?</p>
<p>MAN: Yes.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Now close your eyes.</p>
<p><em>(The man closes his eyes. Hanuman writes on the piece of paper, folds it and gives it to him. He starts to open it.)</em></p>
<p>HANUMAN: No, hold it. Don't open it. I am going with you to the other side. But don't open this paper. If you open it and see what I have written, then you will not be able to walk on the water. You will sink.</p>
<p>MAN: No, no, I will never open it.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Then come along.</p>
<p><em>(They begin walking together.)</em></p>
<p>MAN: O Hanuman, I do not know what you have written on this paper. It has such magic in it. I never imagined in all my life that I would be able to walk on water! You can do everything, Hanuman. You have all capacity. For me to walk on water without your help would have been simply impossible.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Everything is possible by Rama's grace.</p>
<p>MAN: Where is Rama here?</p>
<p>HANGMAN: Rama is everywhere.</p>
<p>MAN: Hanuman, I am really curious to see what you have written there.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Don't open it. If you open it you will sink.</p>
<p>MAN: If you are beside me, it is impossible for me to sink. You will help me. I'll open it.</p>
<p><em>(He opens the paper and looks at it. Inside is written the word "Rama.")</em></p>
<p>MAN: "Rama!" it says. <em>(Laughing.)</em> Again Rama, even here!</p>
<p><em>(The man immediately sinks.)</em></p>
<p>MAN: O Hanuman, save me, save me!</p>
<p>HANUMAN: No. You sneer at my Rama, you ridicule my Rama. I won't save you. He who mocks my Rama, he who criticises my Rama, can never have my compassion. I repeatedly asked you not to open it. You disobeyed me, and then, what is worse, you sneered at my Rama. This is your punishment. I have no love for you. If someone does not care for my Rama, I in turn do not care for that person. Sink! Let your life end. For me, a life without Rama is a life of misery. I want you also to feel that a life without Rama is of no use; it is simply a life of destruction. In fact, you shall learn that a life without Rama is meaningless, useless, impossible. A life with Rama is a life of constant achievement, constant glory, constant bliss.</p>
