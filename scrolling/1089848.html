<p>In the spiritual life, the awakening of the soul is not enough. Many people are awakened to the truth, to the inner life. But after being awakened, one has to dive, one has to run, one has to fly. One has to dive into the innermost, run to the farthest, fly to the highest. Only then can the seeker's awakening blossom into the flower of realisation.</p>

<p>To make oneself every day an object of total dedication and surrender is the highest form of bliss. Bliss comes when 'I and mine' and 'thou and thine' leave us for good. Only when we can say that God is ours and we are God's can bliss come. Then, when we feel that God is manifesting in and through us, we get greater bliss. And finally, when we feel that we exist to please God and God alone, when we feel that we came into the world only to please God, then the greatest bliss dawns in our devoted and surrendered heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Compassion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Compassion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the ordinary, unaspiring life, compassion is a very tricky word. We say 'compassion' when we mean to say 'attachment'. In the human world there is no compassion; it is all unconscious attachment. When people who live in the physical world say that they are showing compassion to someone because he is weak and he needs guidance, this is not true. It is only attachment, and from this attachment they expect an aggrandisement of their own ego. Consciously and deliberately, or sometimes unconsciously, they are trying to feed their ego.</p>
<p>In the human world, we can sympathise with someone and feel that we can become one with him because we are ignorant. I am ignorant; you are ignorant; so easily I can become one with your ignorance. But to say that we are showing compassion here is foolishness. The body cannot show compassion. The physical consciousness cannot show compassion. It is only the soul that can offer compassion to the physical, the vital and the mental. Only then do we see real compassion. At that time compassion is the only reality.</p>
<p>Outer compassion comes from inner illumination. If one is inwardly illumined, then automatically his illumination will take the form of compassion in the outer life. First comes inner illumination; then comes the manifestation of this inner illumination in the outer life. This is compassion. If one says that he is offering compassion before he is inwardly illumined, he is only deceiving himself. What he calls compassion is only his unconscious way of showing attachment towards the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>In the divine world, we offer compassion because we have reached the highest. From the top of the tree we are coming down to meet the root of the tree. But if we stay at the foot of the tree and somebody else also stays at the foot of the tree, who is going to show compassion to whom?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Determination</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Determination" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The difference between determination and divine will power is this: determination is in the mind; divine will power is in the soul. Because the mind is very, very limited, mental determination is not enduring; it is all fluctuation. Mental determination is constantly being destroyed since the mind accepts different ideas at every moment. But the will of the soul is everlasting, ever-progressing and ever-fulfilling because it is one with the Will of the Supreme.</p>

<p>It is necessary always to discriminate between the soul's needs and the body's demands. When we become one with the body's demands, we automatically remain unfulfilled. But when we fulfil the soul's needs, at that time we sing the song of eternal fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Divinity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Divinity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God is in everything; that is why everything is divine. But with our aspiration we have to see how much divinity each thing has. In the tiger there is God; so the tiger is divine to some extent. But the quantity of divinity we find in the tiger cannot be as much as the quantity we find in a human being. We have to see the amount of divinity housed in each object. God is inside everything, but in the field of manifestation we have to know how much divinity a chair has and how much divinity a spiritual Master has. When one is wise one will see divinity infinitely more in a spiritual man than in a mad elephant. So in our life of aspiration, we have to be careful when we deal with people and mix with them. We have to approach the person or thing that embodies the most divinity. This is called divine wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are people who mock at faith. They say that those who have faith are those who have failed in life. They say that we have faith in God just because we have been frustrated or have failed in our career. But faith is the one eye, the one real eye, that is shared by both God and man. Man sees God with the eye of faith, and God sees man with the same eye of faith. Man is not aware of the fact that he sees God with the eye of faith, but God not only sees with the eye of faith but at the same time is conscious of what He is doing.</p>
<p>Our faith in God is very often conditional; but God's faith in us is always unconditional. We start our spiritual journey with fifty percent faith, saying, "God, I shall give You this; then You can give me that. I shall give You my aspiration; then You will give me Your blessings and so forth. " There is a fixed hour when God will kindle our consciousness whether we have faith in Him or not. He waits for the choice hour, and when the hour strikes, He comes and gives us what He wants to give. But that doesn't mean that we shall not aspire, that we shall live in the world of sleep and not make any personal effort. No! We shall go on like a true farmer and cultivate the soil with sincere dedication and regularity, and after we do our part, we will leave it up to God to decide when He wants to give us the bumper crop of realisation.</p>
<p>Faith is the eye that sees the future in the immediacy of the present. If we have faith in the spiritual life, we do not stumble, we do not walk, we do not march. No! We simply run the fastest. If we have implicit faith in God, if we have implicit faith in the Inner Pilot and in our own aspiration, then we constantly run the fastest towards our destined goal.</p>
<p>Once faith is lost, it is almost impossible to get it back. Once we lose faith in a spiritual teacher, in an ordinary human being or even in an idea, we will have to suffer for a long, long time before we get it back. If we lose faith in somebody else, we may get it back with great difficulty after a few months or a few years. But if we really lose faith in ourselves, then we have lost everything. We are worse than a street beggar. If we have faith in ourselves, then we can ultimately become divine. But if we don't have faith even in ourselves, our case is really helpless. It is useless to have faith in God, whom most of us think is in Heaven, if we don't have faith in ourselves on earth.</p>
<p>We have to have faith that we can realise God, either in this incarnation or in some future incarnation. We have to have faith that we can be the possessor of infinite Light, Peace and Bliss. We have to have faith in our aspiration, in our concentration, in our meditation and contemplation. Then only will our goal of God-realisation and the divinisation of human nature and earth-consciousness become ours.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Faithfulness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faithfulness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We have to be faithful both in the inner world and in the outer world. When we are faithful to our inner cause, to our inner life, to our life of aspiration, or even when we are faithful to our outer activities, we feel that our divinity is blossoming petal by petal. When we go deep within we see that there is only one person who is constantly and eternally faithful to us, and that is God. From time immemorial He has been faithful to us, faithful to His creation. Unfortunately, His creation is not faithful to Him.</p>
<p>If we follow the spiritual life, naturally we will want to go to the Source, which is God. We will want to be as divine and great as the Source. If our ultimate aim is to become divine or to become God Himself, then we have to be faithful to the world that we are living in. How do we have to be faithful? We have to be faithful to attend at every moment to what we say and what we think. When a thought comes to us early in the morning, if it is a divine thought, then we have to feel that it is a blessing that has entered into us. This blessing we will have to offer to the world around us. If we can faithfully and silently carry this divine thought to the outer world, and offer it to the outer world, then we are fulfilling the God inside us.</p>
<p>If we are following the path of spirituality, we also have to be absolutely faithful to our own inner life. We have to have a path of our own and be one hundred percent faithful to our path. If we have a spiritual Master, we have to be one hundred percent faithful to him. We have to be faithful to our inner life, to the path and to the Master we follow. But a day will come when we will realise that we can be faithful to the inner discipline, the path and the Master, only when we are faithful to ourselves.</p>
<p>When we perform any action, we have to feel in this action the life of God, the hands of God. When we are eating we have to feel that the food is God. If we can see and feel God in everything and feel our constant oneness with God, then automatically we will be faithful to ourselves; and when we are faithful to ourselves, at that time we are bound to get what we are aspiring for.</p>

<p>God's Heart means God's Love. God's Love means God's Oneness. God's Oneness means God's Delight. God's Delight means God's Perfection. And God's Perfection means our unconditional acceptance of God's Will and God's unconditional acceptance of our ignorance.</p>
<p>God's Heart is empty. When God's Heart is filled with man's gratitude, then God will be fulfilled both here on earth and there in Heaven. When we fill God's Heart with our constant gratitude, then God will play His role by manifesting Himself in and through us.</p>

<p>When human-realisation fails and disappoints us, God-realisation becomes a reality. Before that, human-realisation is all reality and God-realisation is unreality for us. God-realisation comes when we feel that God is the only person in Heaven and earth who cannot disappoint us.</p>
<p>For God-realisation, what we need is outer strength and inner strength. Outer strength we shall use to see God in everything. Inner strength we shall use to feel that we are destined to reach our goal. The moment we feel that God-realisation is our birthright, God-realisation can no longer remain a far cry. We have to feel that we have been chosen to realise God in this incarnation. If we can grow into this reality, God-realisation will soon be ours.</p>

<p>Grace is our true meal. A true devotee can really and truly live on God's Grace. The Bible has taught us, "Man does not live by bread alone." This is true; but I wish to say that man can live by God's Grace alone. If a spiritual person, an aspirant, really cares for God's Grace, then I wish to say that he can live by God's Grace constantly and eternally.</p>
<p>God's Grace is God's self-revealing, self-fulfilling eternal Existence. We have to know that it is God's Grace that will give us illumination, liberation and realisation. The infinite life, the eternal life, God's infinite wealth will belong to the aspirant who really cares for the Supreme's Grace, which is our only meal.</p>

<p>Let us take God as a shopkeeper. He sells many things: love, joy, beauty, purity, grace and many, many other things. But in his shop there is one thing that is most expensive, and that is gratitude. When we go to God the shopkeeper, everything we can buy because it is quite cheap. But when we try to buy gratitude we are shocked when we hear the price. We don't have that much money. Why? Because to buy gratitude we have to become aspiration itself, dedication itself, devotion itself, surrender itself. Our life of aspiration, dedication, devotion and surrender will be our currency to buy gratitude from God's shop.</p>
<p>We are under the impression that gratitude is something we have which we are not giving to God; but we are mistaken. We can have nothing to give to God unless and until we have first gotten it from Him. Gratitude has to come from God directly. If God does not give us the sense, the feeling, the flower of gratitude within us, then we can never offer gratitude to Him.</p>
<p>We must cry to God for the power of gratitude. In the spiritual life, a moment of sincere gratitude to the Supreme is equal to an hour of most intense aspiration, concentration, meditation and contemplation. Gratitude has the mightiest power to win God, but we have to get it before we can give it.</p>
<p>We all use the word 'gratitude'. We try to make others feel what gratitude means, but we ourselves do not know, we ourselves have never felt it in the strict sense of the term. Everything else has been born in the earth-consciousness, but gratitude has yet to take birth. When divine gratitude takes birth in our human life, God-manifestation will not remain a far cry. When gratitude takes birth in human life, God's Reality will be able to manifest itself on earth.</p>

<p>There is only one Guru, and His name is the Supreme. The human Guru is the door; the divine Guru is the Throne. You can come right up to the door, but unless and until you sit on the Throne, you won't be satisfied. If you knock at the door, the divine Guru, who is the Supreme, will come and open the door and take you to His Throne. But first you have to knock at the door. If you don't knock at the door, then this divine Guru will not hear. It is through the human Guru that you can go to the divine Guru.</p>
<p>The disciple who feels that the Guru is going to do everything for him, the disciple who feels that the Guru loves him more than the disciple loves himself and has more concern for him than the disciple has for himself — that disciple is really wise. This kind of disciple will realise God much sooner than the disciple who thinks that his relationship with the Guru is one of give-and-take. Some disciples think that if they give the Guru five dollars, then the Guru will give them at least five dollars in return, if they give a little aspiration, then the Master will give them a little realisation — that it is always give-and-take. But the real disciple feels that whether he gives anything or not, the Master will give him everything. The disciple who has this feeling will be the dearest inside the Master's heart.</p>
