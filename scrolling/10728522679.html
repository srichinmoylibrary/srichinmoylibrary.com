<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. My personal opinion of Jesus Christ is that he is God’s Son. If you feel that he has not achieved anything, unfortunately I cannot see eye to eye with you. On the strength of my own realisation, I know that he is a real Son of God and a real world-Saviour. He was God-realised and fully illumined. He had a heart full of compassion; his heart was a flood of compassion. He was, he is and he will always remain a Saviour to mankind.</p>
<p>But if somebody says that he is <em>the</em> Saviour, the only Saviour, and that Krishna, the Buddha and others are not Saviours, then unfortunately I cannot agree, because I know these other great Masters as well as I know the Christ. If we say that the Christ is the only chosen Son of God, then we are limiting God. These other Masters did exist. These are all God’s chosen children of the highest order. They are brothers and God, the Supreme, is their Father. How do these Masters become chosen? They are chosen because they have sacrificed their desires: they have accepted only the life of aspiration — divine aspiration and inner cry.</p>
<p>The achievement of Jesus Christ is extraordinary. No spiritual seeker of the Truth can deny it. The moment a sincere seeker enters into the domain of spirituality, which is real reality, at that time he will immediately see how great, how sublime, how high, how far beyond the flight of his imagination, is the Throne of Jesus Christ. This I say on the strength of my own inner experience and realisation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Was the Christ an Avatar?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Was the Christ an Avatar?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An Avatar means the direct representative of God — God in human form. It is a matter of individual opinion whether Christ was an Avatar. I can only say something on the strength of my own realisation, and on the strength of your own realisation you can say something else. On the strength of my own realisation I wish to say that he was, is and shall always be an Avatar. If others want to refute this, they are perfectly free to do so. This is a personal realisation of mine.</p>
<p>An Avatar is someone who is the direct representative of the Highest Absolute, who embodies God’s Vision and Reality all at once. The Christ embodied the Vision and manifested the Reality all at once. Not only did he embody, but he embodies it still, and he shall eternally embody God’s Vision and Reality, along with Krishna, the Buddha, Ramakrishna and others. They all came from the same root, only with different names. This moment we say “Krishna” because we like the Krishna form. The next moment we may like the Buddha form, so we will call him the Buddha. At another moment, we may call him the Christ. But they are eternally one: the Christ, the Buddha, Krishna, Ramakrishna and other Avatars.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Christ consciousness and the Cosmic consciousness go together. The Cosmic consciousness is like a house. Since it is a house, somebody is expected to live there. Who lives there? The Christ consciousness. Then again, in the divine Game the players change their roles. The Christ consciousness becomes the hall, since one who has realised the Highest has become part and parcel of the Highest, and the Cosmic consciousness becomes the resident of the hall.</p>
<p>The Christ consciousness and the Cosmic consciousness are one. At times the Christ is inside the house, living in the Cosmic consciousness. At other times the reverse is true. The Christ embodies the Cosmic consciousness. At one time one is the house and at another time the same one is the resident of the house.</p>
<p>On the strength of his highest consciousness, on the strength of his inseparable oneness with his eternal Father, the Christ said, “I and my Father are one.” How is it that he could say this? We all the time say that God is our Father, but to most of us this is just a vague idea. We have heard it from our parents or read it in books. But in the Christ’s case, it is a reality, a living reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why didn’t Christ give any of his disciples realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why didn’t Christ give any of his disciples realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If one of his disciples had been ready, the Christ would have been the first person to give him realisation, for then he could have shouldered some of the Christ’s responsibilities. On the physical plane when you have something, you may not give it to others because you do not want others to have the same glory. You are insecure. But on the spiritual plane it is not like that. On the spiritual plane if I get something, I give it most willingly. I know that if I give, that person who receives will be able to work for the Supreme most effectively. The only thing is that in the spiritual world it is not possible to give if someone is not ready to receive.</p>
<p>The worst possible curse is to become a Guru. The suffering that a real Guru goes through by becoming one with his disciples is real torture. Ramakrishna’s theory was always to remain a seeker, a child. Once you become a Guru, you have to learn to drink poison at every moment, and nothing else. Of course, in your inner life you can drink nectar, but in the outer life you have to drink poison. Christ would have been the first person to give realisation to his disciples, but who was ready to receive it? One disciple betrayed him: one denied him; one doubted him. All kinds of things his disciples did to him. Some of them did not get the opportunity. Otherwise, they would also have done some undivine things. This is the fate of all spiritual Masters.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He had special concern for Peter. He made him head of the church because he had to have a leader. So the leader got perhaps a little more. But when it was a matter of real realisation, he could not give it. He could not give it because his disciples were not receptive enough.</p>

Sometimes when I read about him I feel sorry that he is accused in this way." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways of seeing this incident. One way is to say that Judas was very bad, that everything was his fault, that because of Judas’ evil nature the Christ was crucified. The other way is to say that Judas was an instrument of God’s Will. This way says that if God had not wanted His Son to be crucified, then Jesus could not have been harmed. He wanted Jesus to be crucified; therefore, He used Judas as His instrument to bring this about.</p>
<p>From the highest point of view, sometimes it is necessary for the evolution of the world that a sacrifice be made on the physical plane. Your son may not listen to you when you tell him to do the right thing. But if you fall sick, then he will listen to you. By having the Christ make the supreme sacrifice, God did accelerate humanity’s progress. If humanity had listened to the Christ, then there would have been no necessity for him to be crucified.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that hostile forces also played their role. From one point of view, it was a great loss for the world that the Christ was crucified. If he had been able to live a few more years, he would have been able to manifest more of God’s Light and this would have been of great benefit to the world’s spiritual evolution. But from the point of view of God’s Eternal Time, it was all part of the Cosmic Game. So this is a very complicated matter, and each individual has to see the incident according to his own level of evolution.</p>

When one attains Self-realisation, to what degree does a human being really possess the right to say, “I and my Father are one”?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The great Catholic mystic Meister Eckhardt once said, “I and my Father are one in my proceedings.” Then the Catholic Church threatened to burn him at the stake. To the Church, it was blasphemy. When one attains Self-realisation, to what degree does a human being really possess the right to say, “I and my Father are one”?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What we call Self-realisation has various levels. There are people who have realised God on the vital plane. Others have realised Him on the physical plane or on the mental plane or on the intuitive plane. Some have realised Him on the supramental plane, which is beyond the overmind, and far beyond the mental plane. But the greatest Yogis have realised God on all the planes, from the highest to the lowest levels of consciousness. They act always from the Divine Consciousness, from God’s Consciousness. Since they act from the Divine Consciousness and are absolutely one with God’s Cosmic Play, they have every right to say that they are one with God. It is every soul’s own birthright to be totally one with God.</p>
<p>The Christ was absolutely right when he said, “I and my Father are one.” Sri Ramakrishna, who was the worshipper of Mother Kali, in his later years identified himself with Kali to such an extent that his consort, Sarada Devi, addressed him as Kali and his disciples also said that he and Kali were one. In his early meditative years, Ramakrishna used to pray ardently to Kali. But when his realisation was complete on all the planes, he became totally, consciously one with Kali. His disciples and his consort saw and felt that he was not a human being but the Goddess Kali herself. Kali is a Goddess and the Supreme Goddess. So, when one realises God on all levels of consciousness and is able to act from God’s Supreme Consciousness, then one can easily say that he and God are one. But only on the strength of one’s absolute conscious identification with God, the Divine, the Supreme, may one declare that he and God are one.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What was the predominant quality of Christ?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What was the predominant quality of Christ?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, it is impossible for a human being to bring all his divine qualities to the fore; they are not at his command. But in the case of the great spiritual Masters, all the qualities are there and they can bring them to the fore at any moment. If they want to show compassion, they will show compassion. If they want to show light, peace and bliss, they also have these qualities at their beck and call.</p>
<p>So we cannot name one predominant quality. The seeker has to feel which quality, which aspect, inspires him most. If the seeker likes the compassionate aspect, then he will pray to Jesus to show him his Compassion. If the seeker needs humility, let us say, he will pray to Jesus to give him humility. But we cannot say that these are his predominant characteristics. As a spiritual Master, the Christ embodied all divine qualities: humility, purity, compassion and so on. But again, on the strength of his oneness with his Father, he also embodied divine authority. If people want to criticise him, they can say that he was proud. This is how ordinary people will understand his divine authority. But the Christ’s divine authority was not autocratic. Far from it. On the strength of his oneness with the absolute Highest, authority came.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What the Christ said is extremely important. People who only believe what they see with their naked eyes are only eating half the fruit. If you want to scrutinise the Truth to see whether it has a tail or a nose, then you will lose it. Truth is a matter of identification. This is the Christ’s pronouncement about faith and doubt.

The human Christ, the carpenter’s son, lived on earth for thirty-three years, but the divine Christ who realised God, who became one with God, who represented God and still represents God on earth, is still alive and, at the same time, is taking birth in human hearts every day.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any difference between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Yoga?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any difference between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Yoga?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ultimately there is no difference. Christ realised God and offered God to mankind. In Yoga, also, the ultimate aim is to realise God and offer Him to humanity.</p>
<p>In Yoga we have four paths. The first three we call major; then there is one which is a branch, but it is also very powerful. The three major paths are the path of <em>Karma Yoga</em>, or selfless action; the path of <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>, or love, devotion and surrender; and the path of <em>Jnana Yoga</em>, or wisdom. In <em>Jnana Yoga</em> there is a significant branch which we call <em>Raja Yoga</em>, the Yoga of mysticism. These four paths all lead to the destined Goal.</p>
<p>Since the teaching of the Christ was founded upon love and compassion, it would fall under the category of <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>. But again, we have to know that love itself is wisdom. To say that love is one thing and that wisdom is something else, is wrong. He who loves God has the greatest wisdom. Love and wisdom cannot be separated. Again, love and service cannot be separated. If I love someone, then I serve him constantly. The very function of my life, the very purpose of my life, is to serve the person I love. So love is service and love is wisdom. But when we want to differentiate the paths, we say that this one is love, this one is wisdom, this one is service and so on.</p>
<p>So, to come back to your question, there is no ultimate difference in teachings. But even in the same subject, each teacher has a different way of interpreting or emphasising the truth. If there are two teachers teaching the same subject, they will interpret it in two different ways. But at the time of examination there will be only one examination. The ultimate teaching of Jesus Christ and the ultimate teaching of our Yoga is conscious oneness with God. The Christ said, “I and my Father are one.” We Indians say, “I am the Brahman.” The Brahman is the absolute Transcendental Reality and Truth. The Christ performed forty-four miracles and gave a most fruitful, soulful sermon. But he has become humanity’s heart, head and life-breath not because of his miracles, but because he said one thing: “Father, let Thy Will be done.” The world has accepted him and is cherishing, treasuring and worshipping him because of this divine utterance: “Father, let Thy Will be done.”</p>
<p>The spiritual Masters try to adapt themselves to the circumstances, to the awakening consciousness of each individual. Some individuals find it easier to follow the path of love, while others find it easier to follow the path of wisdom. Still others find it easier to follow the path of selfless action. But the Goal, the eternal Goal, remains the same. Those who follow the traditional Indian paths of Yoga, and those who follow Christianity, the path of Jesus Christ, will ultimately arrive at the same Goal. The Goal is always one, but the roads can be many.</p>

<h2>Question: Who was Ramakrishna?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Ramakrishna is the child of Mother Kali, the child of the Divine Mother, who is compassion and love. First he came to Mother Kali, the cosmic Mother, then he became the Mother Herself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly there is. Sri Ramakrishna brought down another soul as powerful as Vivekananda’s, exactly of the same standard, but he never saw that person on earth. Such a great spiritual Master brought down two liberated souls — Vivekananda and another. But the other one fell. Ignorance covered him, and he never came to his Master. Ignorance enveloped that particular liberated soul to such an extent that Ramakrishna could not find him.</p>
