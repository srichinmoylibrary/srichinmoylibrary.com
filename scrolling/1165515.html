 <p>
SSP 39-51. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions on 27 February 1989.</p>
<h2>Question: Are there any particular birthdays in one’s life that have more significance than the others, or do they all offer equal opportunity?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually each birthday has equal importance and offers us equal opportunity. But each year we have to see how much the mind is awakened, how much the heart is awakened, how much the vital is awakened and how much the physical consciousness is awakened. If the physical, the vital, the mind and the heart are more awakened on a particular birthday, then that particular birthday is much more significant.</p>
<p>Then, if there is a great person who has accomplished something, when his centenary comes — the first hundred years after his birth — it is such a significant thing. On his centenary, the earth-consciousness offers gratitude and joy to the person who has left behind him something exceptionally great for Mother Earth to cherish and also for Mother Earth to use to make further progress.</p>
<p>Again, each day you can consider as your birthday. Every morning if you can most soulfully renew your promise to God to please God in God’s own Way, to fulfil God in God’s own Way, then it will be the re-awakening of your life. That reawakening is like a birthday because new life has come in.</p>

Is every day exactly the same for you or do you feel something special on your birthday?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, every day is my birthday in and through my disciples. When a disciple makes even an iota of progress in anything, specially in the inner life — if you conquer insecurity, jealousy, pride and other weaknesses — then I feel it is my birthday, because at that time my dream for humanity’s perfection is being fulfilled.</p>
<p>In terms of celebrating my own birthday, my relatives, my dear ones, my disciples and devotees who are in Heaven observe it long before my friends and dear ones observe it here on earth. They start long before my birthday. In Heaven they observe my birthday in many more ways than on earth. Anything that we do on earth is very, very limited. When Heaven’s Eye looks at earth’s achievements, they appear like a grain of sand. Again, this grain of sand is extremely, extremely important for the evolution of mankind. Otherwise, if spiritual Masters do not come and offer their spiritual realisation to earth, earth will not evolve. It will remain a stagnant pool and God’s Dream will never, never be fulfilled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: On my birthday, I usually feel that the most important thing is my meditation with you, and I wish that people wouldn’t make a big deal about it being my birthday.

Is that not a good attitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whatever people want to do to celebrate your birthday, they should be allowed to do. On your birthday if somebody else wants to express joy because you are a member of humanity, a member of a spiritual family, then they should be given the freedom to do so. On a birthday, joy is freely available. If somebody gets real joy by telling you “Happy Birthday” or by giving you a cake or by doing something for you, then he should be given the chance. Joy is not only in giving, but also in receiving. We always feel that if we give joy to someone, our role is over. No, if somebody wants to give us joy, then we should accept it. It is reciprocal. Otherwise, when I want to give you joy, why should you receive my joy?</p>
<p>If anybody wants to observe your birthday, to give you joy, genuine joy, then he should be given the chance. Otherwise, his self-giving will be denied. By giving you happiness, joy, a smile or saying “Happy Birthday,” he is expanding his own heart, and when he expands his own heart, it is his own progress. Again, when you receive his sincere appreciation or any good will from him, it increases your heart-power as well.</p>
<p>Very often it is the frustrated mind which in an unconscious, perverted way wants to remain isolated on your birthday. You have to know if others are expressing their genuine feelings for you. If somebody wants to observe your birthday with a most sincere heart’s feeling, then it will add to his progress. But if it is just a matter of buying a commercial birthday card and his heart is not in it, then you have every right to be silent. If you feel that the so-called well-wishers are not genuine in their appreciation or in their love for you, then you do not have to pay attention to them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there any specific spiritual discipline that we should practise to make progress on our birthday?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there any specific spiritual discipline that we should practise to make progress on our birthday?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On that day only offer your gratitude every second, every minute, every hour. If you cannot do it every minute, then every hour try to offer gratitude to the Supreme. In the morning, only once, think of the environments where you were brought up, your school, your college and so on, and think of what you could have otherwise become. If you had steered your life-boat the way your school friends who were not spiritual did, then would you have been happy? No. Even if you are making progress very slowly at the present time, you will be so grateful to God that you are still in the boat and heading in the right direction. Your goal is destined. Most of your previous friends have taken another road, the road of desire. Desire is a zigzag road. It goes this side and that side.</p>
<p>If every hour you can offer gratitude, then automatically God will expedite your progress. A birthday is meant for gratitude. Your soul came into the world to do something really great and good for mankind. That opportunity God has given you, and now you are utilising it properly. Because God has given you the opportunity, plus the capacity to fulfil His Dream in and through your life of aspiration and dedication, your gratitude-heart has to come to the fore. Usually, on the physical plane, human beings forget what they have received from God — so much Affection, Blessings, Love and Compassion. The result you will feel only when you look around. It is not that every hour you will think of your unfortunate friends, no. Only once, early in the morning, you will offer your gratitude when you see what you would have been doing if you had not accepted the spiritual life. You have to see your own inner progress, your own inner love, inner awareness and inner awakening. Gratitude will automatically come when you make a comparison with others who are not in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Gratitude comes either by comparing your life now with what you would have become if you had not accepted the spiritual life or by being aware of the One who gave you the capacity to continue following the spiritual life. There are millions and millions of people on earth who are not aware of God, who do not believe in God, but you are fully aware of God’s existence. Now, your goal is to realise God and manifest Him here on earth. You are aware of your goal; you are awakened. For these things, if you can offer gratitude every hour, then it will definitely expedite your inner progress.</p>
<p>There are many, many things you have done which are good, and for that you have to offer gratitude. Again, there are many, many bad things which you have not done. For that also you have to offer gratitude. Just look at your present consciousness. You are on a particular branch of the life-tree. You may not be climbing very fast, but still you are on a branch. There is tremendous opportunity for you to climb up. Here again you can offer gratitude. In so many ways you can offer gratitude to God. For a seeker, a birthday is meant to offer continuous gratitude so that God can be more pleased and God can use the seeker more confidently and proudly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On your birthday the soul comes to the fore. On other days, the heart is not active and dynamic, the heart itself is sleeping. Inside the heart is the soul. When the soul gets the opportunity to come to the fore, the inner link that you have with God becomes strengthened. Therefore, you feel that something very special is happening. This intensity is very good. You just have to remember that something special is happening. What is happening you may not know and God may not want you to know, but your soul is definitely coming to the fore with all its dreams for God-manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Actually a birthday covers all the twenty-four hours. Suppose you were born at three o’clock in the afternoon. You do not have to take the twenty-four hours from that hour. Right after midnight you can begin to observe your birthday. When the calendar falls, after twelve o’clock, that is your birthday.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on how much connection the soul has made with me. All souls are connected with me, but some souls have made more direct contact, more powerful contact, more intimate contact, and then naturally they get more. Again, if some individuals are praying and meditating sincerely, then every day they get special blessings. The inner gift I am ready to give, but some souls are not closely connected with me, so that is the problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes I may observe the birthday three days later or four days later, but on the inner plane the soul comes to me on the proper birthday. If I am very closely connected with the person, the soul will definitely come and take blessings on the actual day. Again, the soul may come one or two days before or even earlier to observe it. As in the outer life I may observe the birthday three or four days or even one week later, in the soul’s world, because a special occasion is approaching, the soul may come one or two days earlier for special blessings. Definitely the soul gets special blessings. But then comes the question of how much the soul can receive. Somebody may get one cent’s worth of special blessings, while somebody else may get ten thousand dollars’ worth of special blessings. It entirely depends on the soul’s receptivity and closeness with my soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each time a wrong thought comes, just nip it in the bud. Absolutely starve the doubting mind, the mind that tells you it is impossible for you to achieve something good for God, the mind that says, “Guru does not care for me; he will not do anything special for me on my birthday.” True, I may not give you a party, but if you have purity in your mind and if you have the constant willingness to please me, then if I do not give you a birthday gift or even look at you, then you will be equally happy.</p>
<p>The constant negation of wrong thoughts is most important. When positive thoughts come, feed them, feed them. “I want to be an excellent seeker” — feed that idea. But if wrong thoughts come, just starve them. By expanding your positive thoughts and destroying your negative thoughts, you will make the fastest progress. Each moment you are getting a thought, and that thought is ruling your life. If it is a bad thought, then that thought will ruin your inspiration, aspiration, everything. If it is a good thought, it will increase your aspiration and joy. Each moment try to observe what kind of thought is coming. If you see that it is a good thought, then increase and increase its beauty, purity and power. If it is a wrong thought, then do not wait for one second. Destroy it immediately.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Our birthday is the happiest day of our life during the year. How can we make every other day until the next birthday just as happy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Our birthday is the happiest day of our life during the year. How can we make every other day until the next birthday just as happy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> True, your birthday is the happiest day. Other days also you can make the happiest day in your spiritual life by doing two things. In the morning, make a list of your desires. On the list if you have ten things, then try to see if you can take away one item. Out of ten, see if you can bring it to nine, then eight, then seven, six and eventually none. You do not have to write down one hundred desires. Just write down ten. Afterwards, when you see that it has come to only one and then they are all gone, you can make another list. You do not have to think of each desire itself, whether it has come or not. You will automatically get tremendous joy in not having that desire. So that is one way.</p>
<p>The other way to make yourself happy is to reduce your expectation. If you expect anything from others, you will only get frustration. Even if you expect something from yourself and you do not get it, you will become irritated and frustrated. You will be absolutely doomed to disappointment. When you do not get something from others, you get mad at them because they have not fulfilled your desire. When you do not get something from yourself, you feel that you are useless. Then you become depressed and angry. When this happens, just say to yourself, “This is not the right way. I will do the right thing. If I expect something from the world, I will become frustrated, because the world is like that. If I expect something from myself, I may also be unable to achieve it. What I need is patience.”</p>
<p>If you want to develop patience, immediately think of a tree. This tree has not become a tree overnight. It began as a tiny seed. Then it took such a long time to germinate. It became a little sapling, and then it became a huge tree. Such a long time it took! Here also, God has sown inside you a seed of perfection. If you want to become absolutely perfect in just ten or twenty years, it is not possible.</p>
<p>Then comes eagerness. Your eagerness is absolutely necessary. On the one hand, you will not expect to accomplish everything overnight. On the other hand, you will be eager to do the right thing. Everybody knows what is right and what is wrong. Only if people want to fool themselves do they say they do not know what is right.</p>
<p>Then comes aspiration. Aspiration is like a muscle. Previously, you could not take exercise with five pounds. Now perhaps you are taking exercise with seventy pounds, eighty pounds. Like that, take aspiration as a muscle. How will you develop it? By practising regularly. Previously even for one minute you could not meditate. Now perhaps you are able to meditate for five minutes.</p>
<p>The key is thought-control. If a wrong thought comes and you can control it, then you are doing the right thing. If a good thought comes and you expand it, elaborate it, then you are doing the right thing. If they are positive thoughts, allow them to grow. If they are negative thoughts, destroy them. Always by thinking positively, you make the fastest progress. Each hour can be made happy by allowing good thoughts, positive thoughts, to enter into you, and again each hour can be ruined by allowing one negative thought to enter.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only keep the mind empty of thought and keep the heart absolutely pure. Repeat “Purity, purity, purity” or “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme.” If you say “Purity, purity, purity”, it is convincing your mind. If you say “Supreme, Supreme, Supreme”, then immediately, anything that is absolutely necessary to maintain the Blessings that come from Above, you will be able to do. “Supreme” is far better, but if you cannot say “Supreme, Supreme”, at least say “Purity, purity”. If you can repeat it at home, even out loud, that will help tremendously. It convinces the mind. Then you can retain the Blessings you have received from Above.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When will mankind have a birthday?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When will mankind have a birthday?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When ten people meet together, we can call it mankind. Let us say there are ten undivine people. Out of ten, if one of them becomes divine, then there is a great possibility for the other nine to become divine. So that is mankind’s birthday. It is not that all ten will become divine overnight. First you can become fully aware of God’s Compassion, Love and Light. Then somebody else and somebody else. In the process of time, today you may become fully awakened, tomorrow somebody else, the day after tomorrow a third party and so on. If thousands of people become fully awakened today or tomorrow, if thousands of people open themselves to God’s Light, then definitely God’s Love and God’s Delight will descend on earth. The entire earth-consciousness will be inundated. So each individual has to make a conscious effort to become God’s choice instrument. Today you become God’s choice instrument, tomorrow somebody else will become His choice instrument. It is not like instant coffee or tea, no. But with our sincere and conscious effort we can expedite God’s Hour.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What actually is a blessing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What actually is a blessing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A blessing is that which keeps us consciously aware of God’s Presence. Everybody knows how to spell the word ‘God’ — G-O-D. It is in the dictionary. But how many hours a day are you aware of God’s Presence in your life, in your thoughts, in your actions? If you can be consciously aware of God’s Presence in your life during the entire day, then it is God’s Blessing. Unconsciously you may know that God does exist, you may believe in God, but if you are not consciously aware of God’s Presence in your life, that is not God’s Blessing. For a spiritual person, God’s Blessing means to consciously feel God’s Presence during the hours that you are fully awake. To think of God’s Presence, even if you do not feel it, is also a real Blessing for a seeker.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it is somebody’s birthday and you are sincerely identified with that particular soul, then it is like sharing. The person whose birthday it is will definitely receive blessings, and you will receive part of it. Unfortunately, if one hundred people are singing “Happy Birthday,” perhaps ninety-nine are not getting anything. You are singing “Happy Birthday,” which you learnt in your childhood, but you are getting zero. When you see that I am very seriously meditating on the soul or the heart of the person, at that time, if you can identify yourself not with the person but with me, by looking at my eyes or feeling my heart, then you will be able to receive something. Otherwise, while you are singing “Happy Birthday,” you may be in your restless vital-consciousness and you will get nothing.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes it happens that even the birthday person is thinking of rubbish things: “Guru observed so-and-so’s birthday more significantly; many more people came. Here on my birthday nobody brought a cake even, and the entire day nobody said ‘Happy Birthday’ to me.” When all these thoughts come, you receive nothing. I may be meditating on you and you may be getting nothing, whereas a third party may be receiving the special birthday Blessings which I have brought down for you. You may not receive them, but somebody else may get them. They may be receptive. Again, the birthday person alone may receive. For two or three minutes, or an hour or so, she may become receptive and she may receive because it is her birthday, while others are not identifying themselves with me or with the birthday person so they are getting nothing.</p>

 <p>
SSP 52-58. Sri Chinmoy these questions on 2 March 1989.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we remember the cheerful and childlike feeling that we feel on our birthday?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people feel that each time a birthday arrives, it is a sorrowful experience instead of a happy experience. They are miserable that they are advancing in years. They feel that death is attacking them. A birthday means the fulfilment of life, but if you think of a birthday as fast-approaching death, cheerfulness automatically disappears. If you have teeming desires, you will see that not even one desire of yours is fulfilled. In that way you will become unhappy. And if you want to have aspiration in very large quantity, you may see that years are rolling by and your aspiration is not increasing. There are so many ways to make ourselves feel miserable on our birthday.</p>
<p>A child does not think of his future. His joy is in the present. He does not think of the outer life; he does not think of how much material wealth he has or his father has. He thinks of life as constant joy. This moment he is happy; next moment he is happy. Happiness is his life’s achievement. If you want to be happy and remain happy, you have to think of someone who is always happy: another child. Try to imagine God as a little child playing around you. All the time He is playing — He is with you, He is in you, He is for you, He is around you. You have to imagine that there is someone around you all the time, and that is the God-child in your heart-garden. Sometimes He comes and stands in front of your eyes because you are unable to enter into your heart-garden, even though it is your own. If you can think of God as an eternal child, playing all the time with you, around you, then you can maintain your childlike qualities and you will get inspiration, aspiration, joy, inner strength and the confidence that you can be another child who will be eternally happy.</p>
