<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Until now, you have been listening to your friends, relatives, priests and so-called well-wishers. They have played their part. Now you try to listen to your own heart or your soul. Just listen to your heart â€” you will be so happy, and you will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Then from now on, think of God more than you think of religion. God is in every religion. He is in all religions. If you go to God, you fulfil all religions. I know God. I feel God. I speak to God. So I have fulfilled all religions. If you want to perfectly fulfil all the religions of the world, then try to go to God. The religions are life-rivers flowing towards the Ocean.</p>
<p>In one's heart is the Garden. In the Garden is a mango tree. You have come into the Garden, but you have not taken permission from the Owner, so you cannot touch the mangoes. However, if you make friends with the Owner, He tells you to take as many fruits as you wish. Similarly in our life there are many fruits: Peace, Light, Power and so forth. They are hanging on a tree. If we go to the Person who owns the tree, we get all the fruits. Otherwise, we will see all the fruits, but will get nothing. If you pray to God, you will get everything. If you try to please your friends, relatives, priests and religion, and forget to please God, you will not get anything. You will waste your own time by pleasing human beings. But when God is pleased, you will be truly fulfilled. If you leave God aside, you will never be able to please any person in this world. But if you give yourself to God, He will be so pleased with you that by pleasing Him, you will, at the same time, please everybody else.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will please sit in your room quietly for five or ten minutes every morning. When any thought comes into your mind, just kill it. Just reject all the thoughts that are coming to you. They will come and touch you, but you will not allow them to stay. For just five minutes, just be a blank mind ... no thought.</p>
<p>Now, normally we do not hear the beating of the heart because we are not conscious of it. But try to hear it for one minute. Do not be afraid of the sound of the heart's palpitation. Listen to it. Immediately it will come in to offer a word or message. This message is coming from God Himself to you through your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here we come to the secret of concentration and meditation. You have a thousand things to do, and you want to do them successfully. Then the first thing is concentration. For example, you have to go and see your sister in the hospital. Then say, "Let me concentrate to bring solid strength into my system so that I can give her physical strength, power and peace." Then you concentrate this way, and ask God for what you truly want. God will fulfil you if He sees that your mind is sincere and your heart is pure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question Answered At The San Juan Centre</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question Answered At The San Juan Centre" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: When a person is emotionally disturbed, is there any particular formula, some means, by which one can reach out to help that person regain her composure?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You yourself have seen that a person needs help, but you see that she needs inner help more than she needs outer help. Outer help consists of consolation or sympathetic, encouraging words which bring to the fore a luminous and reassuring feeling. The person, when she receives this outer, luminous reassurance, feels that she does not have to worry, that she will be all right. This is outer help, but the real help, as you know, is inner help. Inner help is really the invocation of Peace. First one has to bring down Peace into one's mind, then into one's vital, then into one's physical.</p>
<p>Now the person who feels that he is about to be destroyed does not have that capacity. He feels utterly helpless. He feels that he is going to be destroyed in no time. So we cannot expect anything from him. He who is going to be destroyed cannot save his own life; it is somebody else who has to come and save him. The one who is under the water is going to be drowned, so what can he do? He has to raise his hand so that another person can lift him up.</p>
<p>Now, in whom does the person who feels himself about to be destroyed emotionally have all faith? In the One who is going to help him, inwardly, silently, spiritually. He has to feel that his outer life, which is on the brink of extinction, has to be surrendered either to God directly or to a spiritual person who is able to act as an instrument of God the Absolute Supreme. This spiritual person will infuse the sufferer's entire being not only with Divine Peace but also with the Divine Power, Divine Light and Divine Happiness. So the sufferer must go directly to the Absolute Supreme or to the one who represents Him.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Master, what books do you think will help me in my development?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to know what you expect from your life. If you expect Self-realisation, God-realisation, then I wish to tell you that there are very few books on earth that will help you. If you want Self-realisation, then I wish to tell you that meditation is your book, concentration is your book. The Book of books is meditation. So if your ultimate goal in this life is to enter into the infinite Peace, Love, Joy and Bliss, then I wish to tell you that meditation and concentration are necessary. If you follow me strictly and devotedly, my instructions and my writings will be more than enough.</p>
<p>It is not that I'm telling you this like a jealous person who does not want you to read others' writings. No, I am telling you this for your own good. Reading others' books may confuse your mind. Fortunately, I have covered, for my disciples, all the aspects of the inner life and the spiritual life, in my writings. For my dedicated disciples, I have written amply. If you study my writings every day, you will get a deeper truth each time you read them.</p>
<p>Take one article or even one single paragraph. Read it today. Tomorrow, if you read the same paragraph, it will bring you a different and higher Truth, a higher Light.</p>
<p>When I tell my disciples not to enter into others' spiritual writings, not to read them, it is because reading others' books may confuse their minds. Our people in New York read thousands of books; they read everything that falls into their hands. Then who is the loser? I am not the loser. My mind is not going to be affected if you read these books.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, books that have been written by people who are millions of miles from God-realisation are numerous. You read them and then you suffer. So I say that if you are going to read books, then read about the Christ, read books about Ramakrishna, Lord Krishna, Ramana Maharshi and Lord Buddha. But the so-called "masters," who are growing in the West like mushrooms, will only confuse your inner life and your spiritual life.</p>
<p>Meditation is your reading; meditation is your realisation. If you care to read my writings and then you meditate on even one line of my writings, you will satisfy me. And if you want to totally satisfy me, then you have to meditate daily without fail.</p>
<p>My spiritual presence, my inner presence can be felt by you in your heart every day. But I tell all of you to come here to the Centre because this is the spiritual home of the whole spiritual family. It is the divine house for the disciples of the Supreme. That is why I tell my disciples to come here. Here they will definitely feel the Presence of the Divine.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, Venu, if you read spiritual books about spiritual giants like the Christ, Lord Buddha, Rama, Krishna, Sri Chaitanya, Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Aurobindo and Ramana Maharshi, this will help you. But again I wish to say that if you read books by others who only express their own opinions about these spiritual Masters, you will be making a serious mistake. There are so many self-styled teachers who will only confuse you if you read their books.</p>
<p>Now I wish to tell you clearly and bluntly that if you accept me as your spiritual Teacher, you have to accept my teachings. My teachings (and my writings) can never be separated from my living truth, my living light and my living being.</p>
<p>If disciples do not have the time or the necessity to read my writings, no harm, but meditation you have to practise. Meditation is the common link, the golden thread between you and me. If you want to be inside me, or if you want me to be inside you, what is required is meditation. If you meditate, all your problems and all my problems will be solved.</p>
<p>In the beginning, one may read good spiritual books to learn how to meditate. After you have learned how to meditate, if you do not care to, you don't need to read any more books because it is meditation that brings God-realisation â€” not books. If you meditate, you acquire divine wisdom; if you study others' ideas, you are only borrowing from them.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I would like to ask the reason why some spiritual figures like Christ have healed sick people.

Now, is it possible that the healing done by these Masters takes away the results of karma? What is the reason that some persons are healed and others are not? Does it not interfere with the law of karma?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I would like to ask the reason why some spiritual figures like Christ have healed sick people.

Now, is it possible that the healing done by these Masters takes away the results of karma? What is the reason that some persons are healed and others are not? Does it not interfere with the law of karma?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To begin, let us start with the Christ. He definitely cured people in accordance with God's Will. As you said, He cured so many sick people. Now, I wish to tell you that the first thing is to know what God's Will is, whether God wants a particular person to be cured or not. Nobody is more compassionate than God. If someone says that he has more compassion than the All-loving God, he is not right. However, there are some people who have occult power or spiritual power. They start using their occult power or spiritual power on the vital plane in order to show off or remain on the stage of people's attention. They do not care for God's Will. They do not have the time, they do not have the aspiration, they do not have that kind of dedication to God, to know whether God wants a particular person to be cured or not.</p>
<p>Now, there are other people who only want God's Will to be fulfilled. First they enter into their own inner consciousness or into their highest meditation to get the answer from God. If the answer is "Yes" (that God wants a particular person to be cured), then immediately they will use their own power to help that sick person.</p>
<p>Now, you asked something else in your question: "Does it not interfere with the law of karma?" Every sickness is a kind of imperfection. Sickness is always preceded by some imperfection either in our inner life or in our outer existence. It usually does not come into existence for any other reason. It is due to some inner disharmony from which it is manifested. Now when somebody is sick, it means he has done something wrong. That is why he is suffering. One can say that this is the law of karma operating. In either his past incarnation or in this incarnation, he has done something wrong and that is why he is suffering.</p>
<p>Possibly he has not taken proper care of his health. If one neglects one's own body, this is also a kind of inner crime, an injustice to the body. The body is a temple. Here in the body, God exists. So in neglecting the body, we are doing something wrong, and the penalty for this is sickness.</p>
<p>Here I want to say one thing. Why does God's Grace intervene sometimes? We feel that if someone has done something wrong, he has to accept the suffering. But no: although God is Justice, He is also Compassion. If we take Him only as Justice, naturally we shall have to go through all kinds of suffering as human beings. But if we take God as Compassion, if we approach Him through His compassionate Aspect, then God Himself can nullify His law of karma.</p>
<p>Again, it may happen that because of their tremendous love and compassion for their disciples, some spiritual Masters have taken upon themselves the diseases and sufferings of their disciples. Here the Master nullifies the law of his disciples' karma. Needless to say, the spiritual Masters do this only after taking permission from God. Then God Himself nullifies His own cosmic Law.</p>
<p>So a spiritual person, when he heals a sick person, enters into the compassionate Aspect of the Divine, of the Supreme, and then he effects his cure. God has infinite Aspects. Here His compassionate Aspect overrules His Aspect of Justice. If a spiritual person identifies himself with God's infinite Compassion, he can cure someone and, at the same time, he is not violating God's karmic Law.</p>
<p>So the first thing is to realise God's Consciousness. The next thing is to identify oneself with God's compassionate Aspect. When one does that, one does not violate the cosmic Law at all, because one is fulfilling God in a spiritual way, in God's own Way. He is actuating God's Compassion.</p>
