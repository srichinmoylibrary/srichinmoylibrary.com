  <h2 id="page-title">Gratitude</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gratitude" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We are grateful to God, for He is with us here and now. We are grateful to God, for He has created within us a genuine hunger for Him. We are grateful to God, for He has given us a long express train of hope. We are grateful to God, for He has repeatedly told us that He will keep His promise. What is His promise? His promise is that He will not be satisfied unless and until each creation of His satisfies Him in His own way.</p>
<p>How can we please God in His own way? First of all, we are now aware of God's way of operating. Also, we may feel that something will please God, but how can we know if we are correct in our feelings, or whether it is all mental hallucination? There is a way to know whether we are pleasing God in God's own way. We have to dive deep within and destroy or transform the thought-world and replace it with will power, adamantine will power. If we are afraid of God's Will Power, which is all-powerful, then our life will always remain in untold fear.</p>
<p>We are on earth, here and now, only to please God in God's own way. It is a difficult task indeed, but we get joy only when we cross hurdles. If we do not cross hurdles, then there will be no lasting reality and there will be no lasting satisfaction. If we do not do everything here and now, then there will be no satisfaction whatsoever, for today's goal is only the beginning of tomorrow's new journey. This new journey and the journey's goal will come and greet us, for the achievements of the soul and the journey's goal are inseparable.</p>
<p>When we cry with gratitude, it is the journey's soul that acts in and through us, which is a splendid achievement. And when we smile with gratitude, it is the journey's goal that has become one with aspiration's starting point and with aspiration's ever-transcending horizon.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">In the human world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="In the human world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In the human world there are three things that last forever. At least, so do I think. These are: fear, one's sense of unworthiness and a doubting and suspicious mind.</p>
<p>In the divine world there are three things that will undoubtedly forever last. These are: faith, courage and love. If a disciple has these three things, then he does not need anything else.</p>
<p>Fear, anxiety and doubt: these are immortal, but in a negative, destructive way, whereas faith, courage and love represent or embody Immortality in a positive way. The human in us will one day transcend itself and accept the divine in us with all its faith, courage and love.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Our Beloved Supreme</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Our Beloved Supreme" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready to lead us, but it is we who have to cultivate the desire to follow Him. Our Beloved Supreme is always eager, more than eager, to make us feel that He loves us constantly, but it is we who have to cultivate the willingness to believe Him.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready to help us fight against ignorance-night. but it is we who have to feel the real necessity to be in wisdom-light and not in ignorance-night. If we want wisdom-light, then only shall we accept His Service.</p>
<p>Our Beloved Supreme is always ready and more than eager to cry for us to attain the highest Reality-Height, but He expects in return just a little soulful smile from us. If we do not offer Him a little soulful smile, then He will not be able to create a receptivity-vessel within us. If we do not have a receptacle within us, then when He cries for us, we will not be able to see Him crying or feel His cry. So what we need is a receptivity-vessel when He cries. This receptivity-vessel is nothing short of an echo-reality, for His cry has to echo and re-echo in the inmost recesses of our hearts. This is what our Beloved Supreme longs for from us, so that He can cry and cry from His own ever-transcending Heights only for our salvation, liberation, realisation and perfection — for us, only for us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">God&#039;s Compassion flows, God&#039;s Justice grows</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God&#039;s Compassion flows, God&#039;s Justice grows" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>God's Compassion tells me that I can do nothing without Him. God's Justice tells me that He has given me the necessary capacity to become what I sincerely, soulfully want to become. Not only will God's Justice give me what I divinely want to have, but also it will give me the capacity to become as perfect as God Himself.</p>
<p>The hero in us cries for God's Justice. The beggar in us cries for God's Compassion. The hero in us knows perfectly well that when God exercises His Justice, the hero will be able to run faster than the fastest and will eventually become wiser than the wisest. On him God will shower His better-than-the-best Concern-Height and Love-Delight. Again, in order to make us great, good and divine, God the Compassion is constantly showering His Compassion on us.</p>
<p>The beggar in us is also laziness incarnate. He begs, but only for a short while; then he gives up totally. He does not have the necessary capacity to stick to his principles and be ready to pay the price. The beggar in us only wants Compassion unconditionally from God. God can give His unconditional Concern and Love to the beggar in us, but once we get it, then there is every possibility that the beggar in us will not appreciate it because it was given unconditionally. When God does something unconditionally and man does not do anything to deserve it, then man does not value it. Therefore, God always expects us to do something — to try, to cry — in order to value His Gifts. God can give us whatever we want, whatever we need, but it is we who will not be satisfied. It is we who will not be pleased with ourselves unless we have offered our mite to God's Cosmic Plan.</p>
<p>God fervently wishes that the beggar in us will one day give up begging and start choosing like a divine hero, a supreme hero, who knows what he wants and, in order to get it, offers up his body, vital, mind, heart and soul as a flaming sacrifice. We must not remain always veritable beggars. It is high time for us, it is our bounden duty, to grow into divine heroes and live the life of supreme heroism. What is the supreme heroism? The supreme heroism is to give ourselves ceaselessly and unconditionally so that God can fulfil Himself in and through us in His own way. When He fulfils Himself in His own way, it means that He is liberating, fulfilling and immortalising His expanded and extended Cosmic Reality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">To live in the desire-world</h2><span property="dc:title" content="To live in the desire-world" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>To live in the desire-world is to live on tiptoe. How long can one live on tiptoe where anxiety, worry, tension, fear and doubt reign supreme? In the desire-world, the poison of the individual and the poison of the world, in secrecy supreme, kill each other. The world is killed by the individual's poison and the world kills the individual with its poison. This poison comes into existence from jealousy, doubt and suspicion.</p>
<p>The only way one can stop living on tiptoe is to feel that one is God's creation. The creation can never be neglected by the Creator. As ordinary human beings we do not destroy even a little painting that we have done. So how can God the Creator, whose creation is nothing but an exact image of His own Reality-Existence, destroy the world? Each individual has to feel that it is the need of the Supreme to create him, it is the need of the Supreme to sustain him, it is the need of the Supreme to fulfil him in a divine way.</p>
<p>To live on tiptoe is to forget one's Source, who is also the Source of Light and Delight. To live on tiptoe is to consciously make friends with the negative, destructive world, the temptation-world, where worry, anxiety, fear and doubt run riot.</p>
<p>Instead of living on tiptoe, you can live in the very heart of the Lord's divine Pride, provided you feel that it is your own duty, your sole duty, to cast aside your personal necessity and become one with your Beloved Supreme's divine Necessity. Your own necessity is desire-bound, and when it is fulfilled, inside it destruction looms large. So if you want to find your true satisfaction, then find it at the right place: inside God's Compassion-Height. That is the only place to discover your satisfaction-right.</p>
<p>You are following the path of spirituality. Your heart is all aspiration. In the life of aspiration you are preparing for a life of total surrender. You will not only surrender your aspiration-life and dedication-life, but also your desire-life, your ignorance-life, with equal joy, equal love, equal confidence, equal certainty. Only then will there be no necessity on your part to hide from God or to try to hide your thoughts from Him. You and your integral existence must always reside in the Supreme. This is the only way for you to become totally perfect and inseparably one with Eternity's Vision-Light and Infinity's Manifestation-Delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I was a student of prayer</h2><span property="dc:title" content="I was a student of prayer" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I was a student of prayer, but I can't say that I enjoyed my studies. When I was a student of prayer, anxiety and worry killed me. At times even fear and doubt killed me.</p>
<p>Then I became a student of meditation. When I was a student of meditation, at times I had confidence in my meditation, and at times I totally lacked confidence. Therefore, I did not succeed in a striking manner. Because meditation is all peace-expansion, light-expansion, love-expansion and oneness-expansion, I could have progressed fast, very fast. But I did not.</p>
<p>When I became a student of self-giving, I discovered immediately that my self-giving was growing into something infinitely more than I had ever dreamed of, something that I never would have had the capacity to acquire. What was it? A fruitful life of God-becoming vision-light and God-manifesting manifestation-delight.</p>
<p>I want to remain only a student of self-giving. The other two I do not want, I do not need separately. I do not need them as a separate existence in my self-giving. My self-giving includes meditation, prayer, everything. Therefore, what I need always is a self-giving cry and a self-giving smile.</p>

<p>I wanted to tell God that I need Him constantly. It was on the tip of my tongue. Alas, alas, Satan came at that very moment and ruined my inspiration. The very presence of Satan ruined all my joy, and I totally forgot to tell God what I had intended to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell God that I shall become unconditionally His most devoted instrument. It was all planned. It was on the tip of my tongue. Alas, Satan came and gave me an unwarranted frown. His frown took away all my inspiration, all my joy. All at once I felt miserable, and I enjoyed my misery to such an extent that I totally forgot to tell my Beloved Supreme what I had intended to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell my ignorance-friend that I would no longer speak to him. I had it all planned. It was on the tip of my tongue. Ah, who came to strengthen my promise? My Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell ignorance that from now on mine is the way of light, mine is the goal of delight, and that I must leave ignorance for good. It was on the tip of my tongue.

<p>I lived only twice: once in the kingdom of strangling and devouring animals and once in the kingdom of doubting and suspecting human beings.</p>
<p>I am living now only twice: once in the world of hesitation and once in the world of unawareness.</p>

<p>To grow and experience more and more, to become most spiritually mature, I shall live only twice: once inside the aspiration-plant and once inside the realisation-tree and realisation-fruit.</p>
<p>From now on, I shall make it a special point to live in my aspiration-world. There I shall see that my beloved Lord is crying and ascending to open up a new world of light, a new world of promise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The purpose of human life</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The purpose of human life" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The purpose of the animal life is the quest for individuality and separativity. The purpose of human life is the quest for unity, and not a sense of separativity. The purpose of divine life is the quest for perfection — perfection in the inner world, perfection in the outer world, perfection in God's entire creation. The purpose of the Supreme's Life is the quest for satisfaction, the satisfaction that nourishes the body-reality of His creation and the soul-reality of His ever-transcending Vision.</p>
<p>Animal life is always hurtful. Human life is always doubtful. Divine life is always soulful. The Supreme's Life is always fruitful.</p>
<p>The animal life tells me that by fighting I will get everything, The human life tells me that by becoming clever I can get everything. The divine life tells me that by giving everything I shall become everything that I want to become and, something more, that I shall please God in His own way. The Supreme's Life tells me that by oneness-spreading I shall not only become everything, but I shall be able to offer my all-becoming gift as a boon to the aspiring mankind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What more can I give you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="What more can I give you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>"My Lord Supreme, what more can I give You? I have given You my desire-day. I have given You my frustration-night. My Lord Supreme, what more can I give You? I have given You my anxiety-chain. I have given You my insecurity-train. What more can I give You, my Lord Supreme?</p>
<p>"My Lord Supreme, I have given You what I have learned from my earthbound mind. I have given You what I have done, together with my hungry and aggressive vital. My Lord Supreme, what more can I give You? I have given You my hope-sky. I have given You my promise-sun. My Lord Supreme, what more can I give You, what more?"</p>
<p>"My child, I do not deny that you have given Me all these things that you have mentioned. But you have not given Me the thing that I need constantly from you so that I can be totally pleased and fulfilled, and that thing is your soul's satisfaction-breath. This is the only thing that I need from you. The rest of the things that you have given Me have brought Me joy, and I will do the needful with them. I shall transform them and make them into divine instruments of Mine. But the thing that I need constantly from you, the thing that I need most, you have not given Me so far. Therefore, I am reminding you to give Me your heart's oneness-cry, your soul's satisfaction-breath."</p>
<p>"O my sweet Father, O my dear Friend, O my only Boatman who is carrying me along Eternity's river towards Infinity's shore! They say that I am old, for I am over forty. They say that I am cold, that I have become a finished product, that I have long ago lost my childlike life, my nature's cry and smile. Is it all true?"</p>
<p>"No, no. no, My child. This is far, far from the truth. You are not old; you are bold. You are not cold; you are warm. You are not old, for in you and through you I have created a new world of self-revelation and self-manifestation to see and enjoy Me in the divine, Supreme way. This way is through art. You are not old. After you crossed the barrier of forty I made you a divinely, supremely chosen instrument of Mine and entered into you to reveal and manifest Myself in the world of painting and the world of music. Two giant worlds I have created in and through you for My own Satisfaction.</p>
<p>"You are not cold, you are warm. Because of your warmth, because of your oneness-warmth, humanity's ascending cry and divinity's descending smile have accepted you as My instrument, My most pleasing and fulfilling instrument.</p>
<p>"No matter how old you are according to the earthly calendar, you are not old; you can never be old, and all those who have become inseparably one with you also can never be old. Your oneness-friends, like you, will never be old in My Vision-Light, for you are all in My Golden Boat. My own Aspiration-Cry in and through you all is being manifested at My own choice Hour. My Aspiration-Cry is glowing and growing and offering haven to countless seekers of Truth and lovers of Light and Delight.</p>
<p>"You are not old, and all those over forty who are with you, in you and for you are like your four-year-old children, for they have the same warmth, the same eagerness to be in My Boat. Their eagerness and warmth they have offered to Me to be in My Boat. Therefore, they can never, never be old. They have given Me a free access to dream in and through them, and I am dreaming in and through them. When I dream in and through anybody, that person can never be old, for My Dream is manifesting as an illumining, fulfilling reality that is eternally new, eternally illumining, eternally fulfilling.</p>
<p>"A life of dream, divine dream, is always a life of blossoming, becoming and transcending. All of you in the Golden Boat who are over forty, I am dreaming in and through you. Each one has a special dream. This Dream of Mine in each seeker-lover is My Life-Breath of new creation, new perfection, new satisfaction."</p>
