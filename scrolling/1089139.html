<p>From December 13, 1985 to January 13, 1986, Sri Chinmoy gave a total of nine concerts in Tokyo, Kamakura, Nagoya, Kyoto, Fukuyama, Hiroshima and Beppu as part of a worldwide Peace Concert series begun in 1984. The following pages record some of the peace activities of Sri Chinmoy and his students during the Japan concert tour, including messages for the people of Japan, interviews with eminent Japanese, songs composed during the trip and press and television coverage.</p>
<p>Through these many diverse events Sri Chinmoy offered his universal message of peace to the people of Japan. In so doing, he expressed his love for the nation whose own unique message of peace he deeply reveres.</p>

<p>Message to the people of Hiroshima</p>
<p>My simple and humble message to the people of Hiroshima is this: We shall not look back. We shall only look forward. Behind us there is no goal. The goal is ahead of us and this goal embodies real joy, real peace and real satisfaction.</p>
<p>In order to reach this goal we shall pray for God's infinite Compassion and we shall meditate for God's infinite Love. From our prayer and meditation we shall definitely receive infinite Compassion and Love. With these divine qualities from Heaven, Hiroshima and Nagasaki will be able to offer a fruitful and immortal dawn to humanity. It will be the dawn of universal peace, peace in self-giving and peace in oneness-family.</p>
<p>No other place has suffered as Hiroshima and Nagasaki have suffered. Therefore, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are supremely chosen by God to offer the message of universal peace-the message of peace in oneness-family and peace in the world-family, which is the only real peace.</p>
<p>May each human being on earth join the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in their soulful prayers and meditations for the transformation of the world-mind, the mind that wants to exercise supremacy. In fear there is no peace. In division there is no peace. In destruction there is no peace. Only in oneness there is peace. The mind of supremacy has to be conquered and the heart of oneness has to be brought forward and energised every day. It is the sufferers of yesterday who are now in the best position to receive Love and Compassion-Light from Above and to distribute it to the world of darkness all around.</p>
<p>My message to Hiroshima embodies my heart's most intense cry, and this cry I wish to share with all human beings who are conscious God-lovers, which means all those who believe in God's universal family and oneness-home.</p>
<p>The experience of supremacy must come to an end. From now on, forever and forever, the experience and realisation of self-transcendence should be our individual, our collective and, ultimately, our universal goal, the only goal. This goal of self-transcendence is God's supreme Choice in humanity and for humanity.</p>
<p>So this is my message to Hiroshima. It applies to all those who have special love for Hiroshima and also to those who love the suffering humanity and want to be of real service to the suffering humanity.</p>
<p>Hiroshima</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Message to the people of Hiroshima</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Message to the people of Hiroshima" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>All over the world people have seen quarrels, fights, battles and wars. People are tired of seeing these old things. In Hiroshima the old things reached their lowest abyss. So Hiroshima is the proper place for an absolutely new thing to take birth and to spread its world-illumining light. And this light is oneness-peace in humanity's home.</p>

<p>Everybody in this world is crying and dying for joy, but unless one has peace of mind and peace in one's heart, one can never have joy. Without peace there can be no real joy here in Nagoya or anywhere. The seeker and God-lover in me is praying for each and every human being living in Nagoya and also in Japan to have inner peace, because I know it is from inner peace that they will get true outer joy.</p>

<p>Peace: God's Dream-Reality's Oneness-Boat, Fulness-Shore.</p>
<p>Peace is the aspiration-cry of man's heart in God's Compassion-Eye. Peace is the Satisfaction-Smile of God's Heart in man's perfection-life. Peace is in man's renunciation of his desire-life. This peace is superb. Peace is in man's acceptance and transcendence of his present-day reality-life. This peace is divine. Peace is in man's sleeplessly unconditional surrender to God's Will. This peace is supreme.</p>
<p>If I want peace, if I need peace in this world and from this world, then I must demand peace from my own heart, my own mind, my own vital and my own body.</p>
<p>Peace is at once God's transcendental and universal Language. Each seeker, during his Heaven-ascending prayers and earth-transforming meditations, must learn this language from God Himself. This peace-language only the Inner Pilot can teach a truth-seeker and God-lover. Here we are at Tokyo University. I am offering my heart's loving and soulful gratitude to the aspiring students and illumining teachers of this university. I am offering them my heart's divine love-songs and I am requesting them to spread their hearts' flower-fragrance all over the world.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy sings a song he composed for Tokyo.)</em></p>
<p>My aspiring life sees, feels and knows that Japan is beauty's flower-garden. A flower immediately gives me joy, and inside this joy I immediately feel peace in my outer life. A good thought also gives me immediate joy, and inside this joy I immediately feel peace in my inner life. My outer peaceful joy is illumining. My inner peaceful joy is fulfilling. I pray to God for the inseparable oneness of my outer peaceful joy and my inner peaceful joy.</p>
<p>From the inmost recesses of my heart I am praying to the Liberator, Lord Buddha, to inundate the aspiring consciousness of Japan, his Immortality's choice abode, with his Infinity's Peace.</p>
<p>It is here in Japan that Hiroshima and Nagasaki became the untold destruction-sufferers. May Hiroshima and Nagasaki become the two harbinger-peace-givers for the entire peace-longing world.</p>
<p>Peace: God's Dream-Reality's Oneness-Boat, Fulness-Shore. Peace. Peace. Peace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have also heard much about you. I am told that you are the greatest lover of peace. You and I are sailing in the same boat. In my limited capacity, I also have been trying to serve mankind by trying to bring about peace. Your inner wisdom has touched the very depths of my heart. You have written that after World War Two the Japanese got the real experience of suffering, pain and agony. Their entire existence felt what disaster can bring. The way you have expressed in your writings the experience of the sufferer is so remarkable. The one who strikes does not know how hard he has struck. But the one who has received the blow feels how severe the blow was. The experience that the Japanese got is the real experience. The victors, the Americans, got a different kind of experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, this is the one that I read, and also the other one about your experiences.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Utsunomiya:</em> This is a handy, small booklet, as you see. It is easy to hand out to people. So whenever I go to the U.S. and elsewhere, I take a few of these booklets and distribute them. Many American friends of mine already have copies. It's not a matter of us disliking Americans — not any more — but rather it is a matter for the whole of mankind to remember that this has happened in the history of mankind.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we remember our deplorable mistake, then we will not repeat it. But if it escapes our memory, then we may do it again. A child touches fire and burns his finger. Then after a few months, he may totally forget and then again he may go near fire and be burnt once more. But if he remembers, then he will not go near fire. Similarly, if the Americans remember what they did, then they will not repeat it and the world will not get the same experience.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right, absolutely! The power of destruction is not the answer. Nobody has ever appreciated the power of destruction and nobody will ever appreciate it. It is the power of love, the power of oneness, that is of paramount importance. Peace comes from oneness. People will appreciate, admire and adore the lover of peace and not the destroyer of peace. Japan lost in the war. But the entire world sympathised with Japan's immeasurable loss after Hiroshima. You were fighting and fighting on one level and then somebody came with a most powerful weapon and changed the nature of the fighting. It is as if somebody pinches me and then I attack him with a big knife.</p>

<p>The worst incident of all during the war period, I believe, was the Japanese invasion of mainland China. Without Japan's invasion of China, there would not have been a war against the United States or, for that matter, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So it was not a question of who was bad or good. It was a question of who would lead the whole world to annihilation first. The U.S. was quicker to develop the atomic bomb. Japan was far behind in that particular technology. But sooner or later, if the situation had been left alone, either the U.S. or Japan would have destroyed most of the world. So I keep saying the Japanese should not have any animosity against the Americans. We did comparably bad things over the years, particularly in mainland China. We were to blame.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here I wish to say that human beings are not perfect. The Japanese are not perfect, the Americans are not perfect, the Indians are not perfect. Otherwise, we would all be saints and sages and not do anything wrong. Just because we are not perfect, we make deplorable mistakes. Suppose that today I have done something wrong to you and caused you suffering. Then tomorrow you come back with infinitely more power than I have and you retaliate. If we continue this game, then there will never be world peace.</p>
<p>So we have to stop. I strike you and you strike me. Whose striking is harder, God alone has to judge. But afterwards we come to realise that we have done something wrong and we stop. If I want to remember that your blow was harder than mine, and I decide to again gather strength and give you one more blow, then there will be no end to it. Or often the superior one thinks, "Perhaps my opponent is gathering strength; so let me become more powerful." This is what America and Russia are doing. They are thinking that one day Japan or China will become stronger than they are, so they are all the time trying to increase their strength.</p>
<p>But this feeling of being stronger or weaker should go away. In a oneness-family, one brother may be physically stronger than the other brothers. Again, another brother may be mentally stronger and a third may be spiritually stronger. But it is all in the family, so each one's strength belongs to the others. You are a doctor, I am a lawyer and somebody else is a politician, let us say. The politician should not think that the doctor is useless, and the doctor should not think that the politician or the lawyer is useless. Everybody has his own respective place in our world-family.</p>
<p>We have to have inner strength in order to start spreading peace. Like Mahatma Gandhi said, it is one thing to strike someone; that is one kind of strength. Again, to bring forward inner strength and to refrain from striking someone is another kind of strength. It is one kind of strength to raise my hand and another kind of strength to keep my hand by my side. Strength comes not only in movement. Strength can also be found in remaining calm, quiet, silent. That is static strength.</p>
<p>Japan attacked China. Then it went to Burma and on to Chittagong. When I was a child, how many times I had to take shelter when the Japanese planes, like flies, used to come in the sky. There would be a siren, and we would immediately go into a V-shaped hole. At that time there was no peace. While sleeping, all of a sudden we would hear the Japanese planes buzzing. We were innocent village people, and everybody was frightened to death.</p>
<p>My father had a small bank. A Japanese bomb dropped, and the bank became a big hole-like a swimming pool. It just disappeared and became an open area. Like that, so many places were destroyed. Early in the morning you would be coming outside and bullets would be passing through the trees. Such an experience!</p>
<p>Now I have become a seeker and I do not hold anything against Japan. Why? Because I feel that at that time Japan was ignorant. A child is ignorant, so what does he do? He strikes and breaks things. He does not do it deliberately; unconsciously he does it. The result is that his own hand is broken or he realises that he has struck his dear ones and feels repentent.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a seeker and a God-lover, and I fully agree with you, I fully agree with you, I fully agree with you. In this world, is there anybody who does not want satisfaction? What I want, what you want, what everybody wants is satisfaction. But what kind of satisfaction do most people get? A child throws a ball against a window and breaks the glass. He gets satisfaction for five seconds. Then his parents scold and strike him, and so many people speak ill of him and say that he is restless and useless. He gets a moment's satisfaction from destroying something, but then everybody scolds and insults him. So what happens to his satisfaction then? But if the same child studies well and is polite, humble, sympathetic and generous, he will get a different kind of satisfaction, and nobody will scold him or insult him. People will only love him.</p>
<p>If the superpowers use their atomic power, they will kill millions of people. But God's entire creation will not be destroyed. Impossible! Somewhere on earth, people will survive. These survivors will have no love for the ones who started the war. Let us say I am a poet and you are a boxer. We are members of the same family and live in the same house. If we have an argument, you can knock me down since you are a boxer. But the rest of the members of the family will hate you because the power that you have used is destruction-power and not love-power. Lord Buddha came here from India with the message of peace. Jesus Christ also had the message of peace. Is there anybody who does not know of them? The Christ is known, the Buddha is known and other spiritual figures are known as saviours, and they are remembered with love and adoration. But if the present leaders of the superpowers destroy the world, they will be known as Hitlers or Mussolinis. Now who is going to love a Hitler or Mussolini? I may be able to destroy you, but the world will hate me and I will experience no sense of satisfaction. But if I use my love-power, as Buddha used his love-power and Christ used his love-power, then the world will always remember me with love.</p>
<p>So we have to see which kind of power we need. If we want peace, which is the only satisfaction, then we need love-power. I have to love you and you have to love me. By loving we expand and expand, and the satisfaction that we get constantly increases, plus it lasts. But from destruction we get no satisfaction at all. It lasts for one second and then is destroyed by the hate we get from those we harmed. If I have done something bad, I can brag. But then I look around and see that everybody hates me. Will I get satisfaction? No! But if I have done something good and great, everybody will be dancing with joy, and that joy will last forever.</p>
