<p>At the six-day race, so many runners knew me. I smiled at them and they smiled at me. But my Cahit! He came off the track — he had to shake hands with me, talk to me and give me gifts. He couldn't believe that I gave him such a big gift. All the runners smiled at me, but he came off the track to see me.</p>
<p>Fred Lebow was all appreciation for our Marathon Team workers. He spoke to me most gratefully about our contribution.</p>
<p>The leader, a Greek named Yiannis Kouros, is something! Once he ran 200 miles at a seven-minute pace.</p>

<p>Yesterday it was raining during the six-day race, so I left the track and went inside the car. Cahit came running to shake hands with me. He said that I bring sunshine to him. Then he said he was sorry he was unshaven. Where can I find another Cahit?</p>
<p>Sue Medaglia was so happy to see me at the race. She said, "Because of you, because of your group, I am alive, I am running."</p>
<p>Today I saw divine Kim, with folded hands. She was smiling and smiling. Such a soulful consciousness she maintained throughout!</p>

<p>The man who won the special prize in the over-fifty category in our "Runners Are Smilers" race today is an excellent runner. He will always win, unless somebody else comes. He should bring all his friends by saying that he has got nice gifts. He should show them his trophy. Then his friends will come and challenge him. There is no other way.</p>

<p>The first day I was in Los Angeles for the Olympics, I went out running early in the morning. I asked a man where the stadium was. He said, "Forget the stadium. Go have a cup of coffee!"</p>
<p>On another day, I was walking on the sidewalk when I saw three men — simply undivine — coming towards me. I jumped into the street to avoid them. Very loudly one said, "Jesus!"</p>
<p>In silence I said to him, "Thank you for invoking a very good friend of mine!"</p>

<p>Today in the mini-triathlon only Databir, Pahar, Pulak and Dhanu couldn't swim. In the big triathlon, they would be forbidden — we cannot afford to lose four or five lives.</p>
<p>On the boys' side Kripan was the best! Luckily Kripan was not driving; he was swimming. First he would go to one side, towards Anugata. Then he would go to the other side. His wife was screaming. How much time he was wasting going to this side and that side! He totally forgot about geometry.</p>

<p>When I was giving out oranges to the runners finishing our half-marathon in Flushing Meadow Park yesterday, some of them were mad. One fellow heard he was tenth or twelfth and his friend was eighth. I think his friend was also his rival. He was very disappointed and he said, "Damn it!"</p>
<p>Some runners didn't take oranges. One or two perhaps didn't like oranges, but others were mad at themselves. One or two, when they calmed down, came and took.</p>

<p>This morning I ran four miles. The first mile I ran in 12:13. I said, "Great! Very near 13, my lucky number."</p>
<p>The second mile I ran in 10:21. I couldn't believe it! Instead of descending, I went faster. This was all because I got inspiration from Chidananda. After the first mile I saw Chidananda drive by in his car, and he was smiling like anything.</p>
<p>I said to myself, "Definitely he didn't meditate at six o'clock. Otherwise, he wouldn't be out at this hour." Sunirmalya was in the car with Chidananda. They were going to play tennis. Later Sunirmalya told me they had left the house at 6:16, right after meditation.</p>
