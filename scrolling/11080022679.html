<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no such thing. This hour is most important. You have to know that this is not just like a dentist appointment. It is your meeting with your Eternal Father, your Beloved. If someone wants to arrange to meet you but you are not available, you will say, "Come back again next week." You will make it a point to see somebody at ten o'clock or five o'clock and that will be the hour. If the Supreme comes at the appointed hour and you say, "Come back next week," He will tell you that He can only come at the hour He is supposed to come and this is the only time He can see you.</p>
<p>If you are sick or suffering from something, it is unavoidable. If you have a fever, what are you going to do? This is the only excuse I will accept; otherwise, you will have to tell yourself to get up early.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Recently while meditating I have been having painful sensations. Are these attacks of undivine forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Recently while meditating I have been having painful sensations. Are these attacks of undivine forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The forces are not wrong forces. They are not undivine in your case. These are divine forces, but unfortunately you are pulling them far beyond your capacity. Your inner vessel is not large enough to hold the forces that you are bringing down, so that is why you are getting these painful sensations. Otherwise there would be a smooth, continuous flow.</p>
<p>When you meditate, please feel that meditation is not an act of a greedy person. When we are greedy, we want to devour everything. We become voracious eaters and afterwards we suffer from a stomach upset. In the spiritual life also we have to go very slowly, steadily and unerringly. When we pray and meditate, first of all we have to know our capacity. Here we are not discouraging ourselves. If I know that my capacity is to run one hundred metres, then I will run one hundred metres for a few days or a few months or, if necessity demands, for a few years. But if I have the capacity to run only one hundred metres and all of a sudden I want to run four hundred metres, then naturally I will collapse. I will complete it with greatest difficulty and then I will fall down. I will simply ruin myself. So here also, when we meditate we have to know how long we can meditate soulfully, either five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes or twenty minutes. After that time we may get a kind of unconscious greed, let us say. We feel that if we can get everything overnight, then we will become all God-realised souls. But this kind of greed will be our downfall.</p>
<p>So when we pray and meditate, we have to know our capacity: how much will we can exert and how much soulful love, devotion and surrender we have for God. A little child has some strength, but he does not know that when he pulls down something very big from above, immediately it falls down and breaks his hands and arms. So like a child you are also pulling down something very heavy. It is very heavy in the sense that it has enormous power. And where will the power go which you have invoked? Naturally the power is good power, but because of its enormity it is not able to stay inside you. You are not in a position to house the power.</p>
<p>So when you meditate every morning, please feel the necessity of seeing your capacity. You are now in a position to eat only three pieces of bread. If you see that somebody beside you is eating six pieces, then you think, "What is wrong with me? Why can't I have the capacity to eat six pieces?" But let him eat six pieces if he has the capacity. Perhaps there is somebody else beside you who cannot eat even one piece. He can take only half a piece of bread. So according to your capacity, according to your inner hunger, you will try to satisfy yourself; according to others' capacity, they will also do the same. So, the forces that you are speaking of are not undivine. They are divine forces, but the problem arises because beyond your capacity you are trying to pull them down.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The only disease you have is that you feel that I don't care for you. When that disease is cured, then you will be cured. When that disease is cured, there can be no sickness to bother you. A few other disciples also have this chronic disease. It is a powerful disease, the feeling that your Guru doesn't love you, he doesn't care for you.</p>
<p>I do care for you, but in my own way, in a divine way. My divine way nobody understands. Tension and pressure come from one thought: that your Guru does not care for you. If I did not care for you, then I would not have come to America. I <em>do</em> care; that is why I have come to the world, to the West and to America. Most of you suffer from only one disease, and that disease comes from one cause: the feeling that I don't care for you. Again I wish to say that I <em>do</em> care, but in my own way. Once you understand this, then these pressures will go away and everything will be relaxed. Once you feel that I do care, you will get tremendous joy.</p>

Should I try to work harder at it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the start of a race when the judge says, "On your mark, get set, go!" there is so much alertness and tension. Then, after covering thirty metres, your arms and your legs get a kind of coordination. At that time you feel that you are totally relaxed, that you are not running at all. But your speed is in no way slower; it is still very fast. Just because your mind is not convincing you that you are making some unusual effort, you imagine that you are not running fast enough. But it is not true.</p>
<p>When I do my paintings or write poetry, at that time I go very fast. But I am totally relaxed while I am doing it. So when you are doing something, don't think of the start. At the time of the start, alertness, eagerness, indecision, tension, fear and doubt all come and make you feel that you are doing something. Then, once you have started, these forces leave you. At that time you are in the process of completing your journey. If you think of the start, you will only make a comparison between the start and the point halfway through the race. But this is a mistake. When you are at the halfway mark, only try to reach the goal. Look ahead and don't think of the thing that you did before.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To see blue light is a very good, very high experience. Blue light is the light of pure spirituality and also the light of the infinite. If you see blue light around someone or around yourself, it means that your inner being is responding to the vast infinity or that your own spirituality is now maturing and you are entering into something very vast. Your spirituality has entered into your whole inner and outer existence. If you see blue light around some spiritual Masters, it is because some of these Masters have predominantly blue light, as in the case of Lord Krishna, although they also have all types of light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us take the burning inner flame as our hunger. One day we may be pinched with hunger. Another day we may not be hungry at all, but we do eat. Early in the morning when it is breakfast time, even if we do not have real hunger, we go and eat. It is a daily routine or habit that we have formed which is necessary for our health. We should take food every day, whether we are really hungry or not. If we eat every day, then automatically our whole body is nourished and our muscles are strengthened. Similarly, one day if the inner flame is not burning very brightly, let us say, still we have to meditate. Otherwise in the inner world we shall become weak. We don't get most delicious food every day; it is not possible. Even the world's best cook cannot make most delicious food every day. But still we have to eat. In the spiritual life also we cannot expect our highest type of meditation every day.</p>
<p>Again, the highest type of meditation depends on the seeker's own spiritual attainment and achievement. But there comes a time when one is on the verge of spiritual realisation or one has realised God. At that time meditation is a matter of his own will. Now, in my case, if I want to do the highest meditation, then at any hour, even right after I have eaten, I can enter into my highest consciousness. But that is not possible for the beginning seekers. So, their duty is to meditate for spiritual nourishment each and every day whether they are hungry or not.</p>

Is there a method that would help me keep that joy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There can be two reasons why you lose the joy you have received. One reason is very simple. The mind starts functioning most powerfully and vehemently. While functioning the mind allows obscure, impure and undivine thoughts to enter. If the mind helplessly allows these thoughts to come in consciously or unconsciously, then the joy disappears; it will not last. But if purity is well established in your being, then the joy will last for a long time or forever.</p>
<p>Or it may happen that your inner vessel is small; this can be the second reason. You have invoked light, which is joy itself, but the quantity that you have brought down from above is beyond the capacity and receptivity of your vessel. The quantity that you have got during the meditation has satisfied you but you are not in a position to hold the excess amount, so it disappears. At that time you feel miserable.</p>
<p>So this happens for one of these two reasons. Either the joy is beyond the capacity of the vessel or impure ideas enter into your aspiring heart and the joy, which is light, cannot last.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Initiation and the Master</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Initiation and the Master" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The word initiation is at once sweet and most significant. In India the first thing that one aspirant asks another aspirant is, "Are you initiated?" And then he asks, "Who is your Guru?" If there is no initiation, then the purification of the body, vital, mind, heart and soul will be a painfully slow process. One has to be initiated in order to realise the highest Goal.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word for initiation is <em>diksha. Diksha</em> means offering, the offering of oneself. The Guru gives the disciple a portion of his life-breath and the disciple gives the Master his soulful promise that to the end of his life he will be totally faithful to the Master and serve the Master unconditionally. In initiation, the Master accepts consciously the lifelong ignorance of the disciple whom he initiates; and the disciple offers to the Master a solemn promise that after he has become purified and transformed, he will be a conscious, devoted, fully surrendered instrument of the Master. The Master during initiation will give him the promise: "I shall make you realise the highest Truth, God." Then the soul of the disciple will make a spiritual promise to the Master: "After I have attained my spiritual perfection I shall manifest your Light, the Light of the Supreme, on earth. You make me perfect in my realisation and I shall fulfil you in your manifestation." The Master finally says, "Whether you manifest me or not, my role is to make you realise the Highest."</p>
<p>If God wants to, he may appear before a seeker during the seeker's meditation or in a vision or a dream. He can take a luminous human form and tell the seeker that He is initiating him or He can give him a <em>mantra</em>. This is direct initiation, but it is very rare. Usually, initiation has to be done by a living Master.</p>
<p>The Upanishads, the sacred scriptures of India, speak of three different ways of initiation. In one kind of initiation, the disciple has to come and prostrate himself before the Master. He must be freshly bathed and clean-shaven. Sometimes he has to practise celibacy for a couple of months or years beforehand. He brings rice, coconuts and a few other traditional things. He also has to give a sacerdotal fee in the form of money or service. Then the disciple sits at the feet of the Guru and the Guru whispers a <em>mantra</em> in his ear. This <em>mantra</em> may be a word or a few words or even a few sentences. Then, according to the traditional way, the Guru touches the forehead, back and heart of the disciple in rhythm with the disciple's heartbeat. The aspirant has to practise this <em>mantra</em> all his life. He has to repeat it sincerely, devotedly and soulfully every day without fail. Along with the <em>mantra,</em> the Guru gives him instruction about how to sit properly for meditation, how to pray and how to worship God. This is the traditional Indian way of giving initiation. Last year in Puerto Rico I initiated a child who was only a few months old in this traditional way. I whispered a particular <em>mantra</em> in her ear and spoke inwardly to her soul in the soul's language and told her what she should do when she grows up. This is the only initiation I have done in that way.In the second method of initiation, the Guru exercises his own inner power to lift up the consciousness of the disciple, no matter what consciousness the disciple may be in at the time. The disciple may be in a very low consciousness or a very high consciousness. But the Guru injects his spiritual power into him and, on the strength of his power, lifts the disciple much higher than he was. I have done this kind of initiation quite a few times.The third way is initiation through compassion. Here the Guru slowly and steadily lifts the disciple up to the highest plane of consciousness through boundless, unconditional compassion. I have done that kind of initiation several times.</p>
<p>A spiritual Master can also initiate a disciple through the eyes or by touching him physically, by blessing him on the head and placing a hand on his heart. I have often used these methods. I have also initiated people occultly from miles away while they were in a very high state of consciousness during meditation in their home. But this I have done only a few times. But whatever approach I use, in each case a portion of my Oneness-Breath with the Supreme I offer to those whom I accept as disciples.</p>
<p>While I was working at the Indian Consulate, I read in <em>The New York Times</em> about a disciple who was initiating twenty or thirty aspirants under the auspices of a certain spiritual teacher. He was giving out <em>mantras</em> and initiating people while smoking a cigarette. This kind of initiation is nothing short of a crime. It is not possible to give one's life-breath while smoking a cigarette and it is not possible to give initiation by proxy. If a disciple is a realised soul, then certainly he can give initiation. But if the Master knows perfectly well that the disciple is not realised and if the disciple himself knows it, then if the Master tells him to go and initiate others it is a terrible mistake. If a Master is thousands of miles away from the seeker, he should initiate him directly on the occult plane. If he cannot do this, then he has no right to call himself a spiritual Master. Initiation by proxy is wrong and worthless.</p>
<p>If a disciple wants to have a conscious initiation, the first thing that is expected of him is humility, utmost humility. Let me tell you a story.Once a seeker went to a spiritual Master and said, "Please initiate me." He was a great seeker, but unfortunately he was quite proud. The Master said, "I am willing to initiate you tomorrow, but you have to bring me something or someone who is less worthy than you."</p>
<p>The seeker was happy. He thought this would be easy, since he felt that there were many people and many things infinitely inferior to him. The following day, he brought a blade of grass to the spiritual Master and said, "Here is a blade of grass. I am sure I am superior to this blade of grass."</p>
<p>The Master said, "You are a fool. Look at this blade of grass: How vast is the heart of this blade of grass! Would you allow anybody to walk on your chest? You would be furious. But this blade of grass allows you to walk on its very heart! This blade of grass is infinitely superior to you. Bring me something else."The seeker was dumbfounded. He thought, "You have played a trick on me. Now I am going to create some embarrassment for you." The next day he took some night-soil to the Master and said, "Undoubtedly this is inferior to me."</p>
<p>But the Master meditated on the night-soil and entered into the very heart of it, finally reaching its source. The source had been a beautiful apple. The apple spoke through the Master: "You are such an ungrateful fellow! When I was so pretty, so beautiful, so charming, so tasty, you took me and devoured me with all your greed. Now look at the transformation of my life: how beautiful I was and how ugly I have become. Who is responsible? You! And who allowed you to devour me? I did, out of my compassion, concern and love for you. So you are not superior!"</p>
<p>This time the seeker realised that there was nobody and nothing on earth which could be really inferior to him. He fell at the feet of the Master and said, "Master, here is the one who is really low. There is nobody on earth as worthless as I am, but please accept me."</p>
<p>The Master said, "Today I am crowning you with initiation because you have become true humility. If you are humble, then your goal is really near. If you are proud and arrogant, then your goal will always remain a far cry."The disciple comes to the Guru and enters into the Guru with what he has and what he is. What do you have? You have a soul. What are you? You <em>are</em> the soul. When you have the feeling that you have a soul and you are the soul, then what you have and what you are, are the same thing. Your achievement is not at all different from what you are. With that understanding, with that knowledge, with that wisdom, if you enter into me, then you are not giving me anything, for at that time you will see and feel your total oneness with me.</p>
<p>You have to feel that what you call yourself is just another name for your Master. A feeling of indivisible oneness must be established between the Guru's consciousness and the disciple's consciousness. You may say that what you have and what you are, you are giving to the Guru. But if you are living inside the Guru, then there is no giving and no taking. There is nothing to give and nothing to take. There is only the feeling of growing inside the Guru's heart.Please stay inside me as long as you can, or I should say, forever. There is no time when your soul need be separated from my consciousness. Remain inside me with what you have and what you are, not in the sense of giving but in the sense of belonging. Feel that you belong to me and I belong to you. Let us sing together the song of oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Palmistry, reincarnation and the dream state</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Palmistry, reincarnation and the dream state" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are one or two disciples who have very short life lines. If a palmist looked at their palms, he would say that they won't live beyond the age of thirty-five. But just because they are connected with the spiritual life, just because they are in our boat, they will definitely live beyond thirty-five. If they leave the boat, then God alone knows. There are one or two whose lives would have ended by now if they weren't in the spiritual life, because of drugs and this and that.</p>
<p>The left hand represents the past. On the left hand you will notice more lines, more marks. The left hand is like the storehouse; the right hand is the showhouse. Usually the lines are transferred from the left hand to the right hand.</p>
<p>We always say that boys have impurity problems and girls have insecurity problems. This is true, as we see in the outer life. But your hands declare something else. Some of the girls, I tell you, have much greater emotional problems than the boys, but the girls keep these problems under control, and subdue them. The boys do not keep them under control.</p>
<p>And one or two individuals I am seeing with tremendous will power. One boy has tremendous will power, but he is not using it at all. It is dormant. In hundreds of ways he could have used it.</p>
<p>You have shown me your marriage lines. Some of the boys and girls here are married. But if they had remained in the outer world, by this time they would have married at least three times. I am not joking. And some of you who would have got married are unmarried. So I am saying how fate can be changed if you follow the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a matter of luck. Some of the girls have better luck than the boys. The girls will unfortunately not work as hard as the boys, but how far can luck take you? A dollar has dropped. You have not worked for it, but you can use this dollar to go and buy something from the store. The boys will work hard the whole day for one cent. Then gradually, gradually, they will make one dollar and go on, go on. In the girls' case, some of them have very good luck, but those girls do not have consistent determination to go beyond, beyond.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have, but it does not affect me at all. But you would be affected. How many disciples here would have gone to the other world according to the astrologers? According to the astrologers, one disciple would have been in the other world three years ago. I said, "I don't believe it; I know you are not going to die." Now she is still with us. A great astrologer predicted it. Similarly, there are six or seven disciples whose parents were going to die, but they did not.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity some disciples go to the astrologers and the astrologers tell the disciples that they are going to die. Then there is no end. You enter into a tunnel and you cannot get out.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you sleep with your hands on your chest, you will see all kinds of frogs, squirrels and cats in your dreams. When you sleep, sleep either on one side or on your back, but try not to have any pressure on your chest. Otherwise, you may enter into a solid wall, and it is a bad, bad wall. That is the best way. I see occultly that there are some disciples who keep their hands on their chests quite often. This is not at all good. Some disciples sleep for many hours, but they don't sleep well. They should meditate for a few minutes before they go to sleep.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes before we go to sleep we eat undivine food. Then, it is not because wrong forces enter us that we have bad dreams, but just because of the food which has entered into our system. If we have wrong thoughts while eating, we may think that it is all over; but it is not. At night those wrong thoughts may create problems. So bad dreams are sometimes caused by food and sometimes they are caused by what we do while we are eating.</p>

Is there something that takes place while we are sleeping that we are not aware of?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have sometimes awakened in the middle of the night with a strong feeling of elation and joy. Is there something that takes place while we are sleeping that we are not aware of?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can remember it, then you <em>are</em> aware of it. If you were not aware of it, you could not have told me about it now. After you had the experience, you came down through various descending rungs of consciousness. Because you are a beginner in the spiritual life, there is no link between the first rung and the rung where you had the experience. If you remain in the physical consciousness during the day, then the experience that you have had in the inner world cannot function properly. The physical consciousness does not have a free access to that particular plane of consciousness where you have had the experience. The physical consciousness must be surcharged with the divine light; then only will it be able to have a free access to all the planes of consciousness.</p>
<p>When you sleep, the soul moves from this plane to that plane like a bird. But if the physical wants to observe what the soul is doing, then the physical has to be moulded and guided by the soul's light. You were conscious at the time, but afterwards you could not bring the experience back because you were not aware of all the stages that exist between that plane and the physical plane. So the best thing is to always try to be conscious and open and to spend more time in meditation. If you right now meditate for one hour a day, then try to spend two hours a day. God has given you twenty-four hours. Out of this time you can spend more time in meditation. In silence you can speak more, in silence you can act more powerfully.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Whatever is divine cannot be destroyed, but sometimes the divine in us is covered by ignorance. The psychic body cannot be damaged; it can only be eclipsed like the sun, which at times can be overcast by clouds. But then again the sun peeps through. If we pray, concentrate and meditate soulfully, then the psychic being cannot be eclipsed by human doubt, the cloud.</p>
