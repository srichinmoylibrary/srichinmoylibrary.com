  <h2 id="page-title">The two branches of Jainism</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The two branches of Jainism" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are two main branches of Jainism: <em>Digambara</em> and <em>Svetambara</em>. <em>Digambara</em> means "one who is naked" or "one who has the sky as his clothes." Only men can become <em>Digambara</em> monks. They believe that if you have anything to your name, you cannot realise the Highest. Therefore, they have renounced all material possessions. They keep only a single peacock feather to sweep the ground clear in front of them so that they do not tread on any living beings and a gourd for boiled water.</p>
<p>The <em>Svetambara</em> branch is more moderate. <em>Svetambara</em> means "clad in white." Both men and women can belong to this branch. They often wear white clothes and sometimes a mask across their nose and mouth so that by breathing in they do not kill any little organisms in the air. They lead a very simple life and also follow the teachings of Mahavira.</p>
<p>In abiding by the principle of <em>ahimsa</em>, both branches show their deep reverence for all living beings. In <em>ahimsa</em> they find their lasting joy and their true salvation. Mahavira said, "One who neglects or disregards the existence of earth, air, fire, water and vegetation disregards his own existence which is entwined with them."</p>

<p>Three hundred years before the birth of Christ, Alexander the Great marched across the Asian subcontinent, conquering all that lay in his path. Eventually he reached the Indian village of Taxila. As he and his troops swept through the village, they encountered some naked men sitting directly in the path of the army. They were <em>Digambara</em> monks.</p>
<p>Alexander was curious to speak with the monks and learn from them about their way of life, but they refused to speak with him until he came down from his horse, removed his battle armour and sat down in the dust of the roadside with them.</p>
<p>This Alexander did, to the wonder of all his soldiers. By conversing with the ascetics, he became aware of their deep reverence for life which they expressed through <em>ahimsa</em>. Alexander was humbled by this experience and he ordered the release of a prominent Indian king whom he had taken captive. He then turned his army around and went back home to his native Greece without making any further conquests.</p>

<p>In 1582 the great Moghul Emperor Akbar invited a Jaina monk to come to his court and participate in religious and philosophical debates. Akbar was very fond of these debates and he tried to include representatives from many different paths. The name of the monk whom he invited was Haravijaya.</p>
<p>As a warrior, Akbar engaged in many battles. He was also deeply enamoured of hunting. Haravijaya knew that for him to accept the principle of <em>ahimsa</em> in its totality would be an impossibility. At the same time, he found that Akbar saw the virtue of non-violence. So Haravijaya counselled Akbar to set aside certain days of the calendar when all hunting and killing of animals would be forbidden throughout the empire. Although this entailed considerable personal sacrifice, Akbar agreed to this request. He also released many prisoners and caged birds on those festive occasions.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The source of Mahatma Gandhi&#039;s</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The source of Mahatma Gandhi&#039;s" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Indian Nation, time and again offered his heart's gratitude to his closest friend, Rajchandbhai Mehta. Why? Because it was from this dearest friend, who was a devout Jaina, that Gandhi absorbed the principle of <em>ahimsa</em> which was to mould and shape his entire political life.</p>
<p>Once Gandhi wrote to his mentor-friend and asked, "If a snake is about to bite me, should I allow myself to be bitten or should I kill it?"</p>
<p>Rajchandbhai wrote back, "If the person lacks the development of a noble character, one may advise him to kill the snake, but we should wish that neither you nor I will even dream of being such a person."</p>
<p>Gandhi learnt this valuable lesson. Years later, he wrote, "The votary of non-violence has to cultivate the capacity for sacrifice of the highest type in order to be free from fear. He recks not if he should lose his land, his wealth, his life. He who has not overcome all fear cannot practise non-violence to perfection."</p>
<p><em>Ahimsa</em> does not mean that one will not strike someone or fight with someone. Gandhi's non-violence was the vision of universal and transcendental Light in humanity. This is the vision that he had, that he embodied and that he wanted to reveal.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi's physical frame was very frail and weak, but this physical frame embodied inner light in abundant measure. That is why he became India's unparalleled and supreme leader.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Jina Mahavira: They walked the same streets</h2>

<p>Jainism is a religion of great antiquity. Jina Mahavira Vardhamana, who was a senior contemporary of the Buddha, was undoubtedly the most important of its exponents.</p>
<p>Hailing from the ranks of warrior-rulers, both the Buddha and Mahavira saw the immediate practical implications of the fundamental Upanishadic concept of the Oneness of Humanity. They raised their voice in unison against the prevailing practice of assigning to people their place in society in terms of their birth and family background. This was the foundation of the caste stratification which both these great teachers felt was unjustly discriminatory. The Buddha said, "By birth one does not become a Brahmin or an Outcaste. By action and action alone does one become a Brahmin or an Outcaste." Jina Mahavira asserted the same when he said, "By action alone does one become a Brahmin, a warrior, a commoner or a slave." They both admitted to their religious orders all people without any restriction or prejudice.</p>
<p>While they disagreed on many philosophical issues, they were champions of non-violence and peace and used a common vocabulary to preach a code of righteousness. The Buddha had spoken of the fourfold restraints ( <em>catuyamasamvara</em> ) of Jainism but noted that they were overly stringent. That was to be expected from the Buddha, who preached moderation as the crux of his Middle Path. Mahavira, in turn, thought that the Buddha's teachings reflected inaction or detachment from action.</p>
<p>It is in their approach to dogma that they made a significant contribution to the promotion of free and open-minded intellectuality. Mahavira's <em>syadvada</em> (literally, 'maybe-theory') cautioned that any statement could be true or valid only relatively in relation to a particular context. The Buddha, on the other hand, was specific in his advice that one should not believe anything because it was in a book, was taught by a teacher whom one liked and so forth.</p>
<p>The time these two stalwarts walked the same streets and spoke of their different Paths of Deliverance to the same people must have no doubt been very exciting.</p>
<p>Together their words, deeds and thoughts have inspired millions of people over twenty-five centuries and bequeathed to humanity two great cultures exemplified by many a noble work of art, magnificent edifices of exquisite architectural beauty and stimulating literatures of admirable creativity.</p>
<p>— Dr. Ananda W.P. Guruge<br />Senior Special Advisor<br />to the Director-General of UNESCO,<br />former Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the USA,<br />Eminent Buddhist Scholar</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>The paths of Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha</h2>

<p>Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were contemporaries, although Lord Mahavira was a little older. Lord Mahavira lived from 599 to 527 BC and Lord Buddha lived from 567 to 487 BC. It seems that the Buddha took birth in a Jaina family. Both Lord Mahavira and the Buddha were born in the state of Bihar in northern India. Bihar is considered to be the cradle of both Jainism and Buddhism.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mendicant life of Lord Mahavira and the Buddha brought them into the same vicinity. On at least three occasions, they were preaching in the same village at the same time, but destiny did not allow them to meet personally.</p>
<p>Because of their tremendous respect for each other, Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha were both interested in each other's philosophies. They used intermediaries to send and receive messages from one to another.</p>
<p>There are more than sixty references to Lord Mahavira in Buddhist literature. This has added considerably to our knowledge of Mahavira's life.</p>
<p>Now, thousands of years after these two immortal spiritual lions lived on earth, their light has spread in different ways. Buddhism is found mostly outside India, in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Japan, Cambodia, Myanmar and other places. But Jainism is found only within our Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>We can say that Buddhism has gone out of India to spread India's lofty message of spirituality, whereas, Jainism has remained within the boundaries of India to proclaim India's spirituality.</p>

<p>The Buddha was born into a Jaina family. So, too, was Mahavira.</p>
<p>The Buddha's parents were Kshatriya rulers. Even so, were Mahavira's.</p>
<p>The Buddha's mother, Queen Maya, dreamt of several most significant symbols prior to the Buddha's birth, including an elephant and a white lotus.</p>
<p>Mahavira's mother, Queen Trishala, dreamt of fourteen special symbols prior to Mahavira's birth, including an enormous white elephant and a lake filled with lotuses.</p>
<p>The soothsayers who were summoned by each queen to interpret the dreams foretold in both cases that the child to be born would be either an emperor on the physical plane or a great spiritual leader.</p>
<p>The young Prince Siddhartha enjoyed unbounded wealth. The young Prince Vardhamana also had everything for the asking.</p>
<p>Prince Siddhartha married and had a little son called Rahu. When Rahu was a mere babe, Prince Siddhartha left his wife and child to go out into the world and seek illumination.</p>
<p>Prince Vardhamana married and had a little daughter called Priyadarshana. When she was yet a child, Prince Vardhamana also received an inner call to leave his wife and child and go out into the world and seek illumination.</p>
<p>Both princes renounced all their possessions and became wandering ascetics.</p>

<p>Both the Buddha and Mahavira practised tremendous austerities when they first renounced the world. At the end of six years, the Buddha adopted the Middle Path, while Mahavira continued to practise austerities for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>The Buddha and Mahavira had the goal of attaining <em>nirvana</em>, or complete enlightenment — and they both achieved this Goal of goals.</p>
<p>After the Buddha and Mahavira had attained enlightenment, they each walked countless miles to and fro across the face of India, giving spiritual discourses, answering the questions of aspiring seekers and begging for food.</p>
<p>They each began to accept disciples, both male and female.</p>
<p>Neither one recognised any of the traditional Hindu distinctions of caste.</p>
<p>The Buddha withdrew from his physical body at the age of 80. His last words to his disciples were, "All things composed are perishable. Now, strive diligently."</p>
<p>At the ripe age of 72, Mahavira left the body. On his last day, he uttered the words: "As a dewdrop clinging to a blade of kusa-grass lasts but a short time, even so, the life of men. Gautama, be careful all the while!"</p>
