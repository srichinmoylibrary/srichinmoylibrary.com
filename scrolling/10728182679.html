  <h2 id="page-title">My advice to my Beloved Supreme</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My advice to my Beloved Supreme" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My dear Supreme, my sweet Supreme, my Beloved Supreme, I talk too much, too much, too much. My Eternity's Supreme, how is it and why is it that You do not change my nature? How and why?</p>
<p>Not only do I talk too much; what is worse, I literally die for a listening ear. And as if that were not enough, I also want to give advice to each and every soul on earth, with no exception.</p>
<p>When I give advice, I expect appreciation and admiration from everybody. I expect everybody to extol me to the skies. Alas, nobody pays any heed to my advice. Nobody needs or appreciates my advice. Yet I go on talking and talking, giving advice to each and every human being on earth.</p>
<p>I also advise the members of my earthly existence — my body, vital, mind and heart. But they do not listen to me either. I even advise my soul. I advise my soul-bird not to leave this beautiful cage called the body, for if it leaves this cage, then I shall die. I want to be immortal. I want to remain on earth forever and forever.</p>
<p>I even dare to advise You, my Beloved Supreme. Lord, O my Eternity's Lord Supreme, I know You have many names, whereas I have but one name. Since it is not fair for You to have many names while I have only one, I beg of You to have only one name. If You cannot agree to my proposal, if You do not listen to my advice, then please have only two names. More than two names I do not want You to have, especially for me. Your two names will be Compassion-Sun and Forgiveness-Ocean. When I need compassion, I shall call You Compassion-Sun. When I need forgiveness, I shall can You Forgiveness-Ocean. These are the two names I would like You to have from now on. All Your other names will no longer be used by me.</p>
<p>O my dear Supreme, O my Lord Supreme, I have advised You time and again. Now is the time for me to beg You to grant me a most special boon. I do not want to remain an idle talker any more. I wish to become an active doer. Finally, I would like to become a selfless lover. Then I shall love You with my self-giving heart, with my self-giving life and with my self-giving oneness-existence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Indifference</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Indifference" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Indifference reigns supreme in my life.</p>
<p>My body is indifferent to the dynamic urge of my vital. My vital is indifferent to the well-earned rest of my body.</p>
<p>My mind is indifferent to the soulful cry of my heart. My heart is indifferent to the inquisitive quest of my mind.</p>
<p>My soul is indifferent to the slow efforts, slower success and even slower progress of my life.</p>
<p>Even my Beloved Supreme, it seems, is indifferent to my supreme realisation. Had He flooded my entire being with His Concern supreme, I am sure I would not have been waiting for millennia for my realisation.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, O my Beloved Supreme, do tell me why You are indifferent to me, and why the rest of the members of my family are indifferent to one another.</p>
<p>"My sweet child, I am not indifferent to you. Dive deep within and you will see that constant Concern is My only name.</p>
<p>"And about your body, vital, mind, heart and soul, I wish to tell you that they can be freed from the fatal disease of indifference only by using the medicine oneness-concern. When oneness-concern plays its role within and without, satisfaction at every moment shall loom large in your life. At that time the indifference-blow will be found nowhere. Only the oneness-flow will be found all-where."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Independence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Independence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Independence, independence, independence!</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it is dependent on the persons it agrees with. It thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it sees eye to eye with others.</p>
<p>The divine in me thinks otherwise. It thinks that when it agrees with others, it enlarges its vision and establishes firmly its oneness with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The human in me feels that it loses its independence the moment it takes something from others or even expects something from others.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me feels that God's creation is for give and take. Give what you have and take what you need, for there is only one common Source, and that Source is God. This moment God is playing the role of the Giver through me, and the next moment He is playing the role of the Receiver through me. It is all oneness-game.</p>
<p>The human in me thinks that it loses its independence as soon as it starts thinking of others, whether they are good or bad. It feels the supreme necessity of thinking only of itself and not of anybody or anything else, because it feels that nothing belongs to it.</p>
<p>The divine in me feels otherwise. The divine in me thinks, feels and knows that the moment it thinks of God, it creates a thought-world that is the precursor of an action-world. Once we have established a reality in the thought-world, then the next step is to bring that reality into the action-world for manifestation. In our action-life only can we have true satisfaction.</p>
<p>The divine in me knows that there is and there can be no such thing as independence. It is all dependence, and inside dependence what looms large is the message of constant oneness. God gives us what He has-His Compassion. We give God what we have — our love. God gives us what He is — His Goodness. We give God what we truly are — our aspiration to become greater.</p>
<p>We depend on God for His Compassion. God depends on us for His Manifestation. This kind of dependence is actually mutual oneness playing different roles at different times, for constant satisfaction and constant perfection, for constant perfection and constant satisfaction.</p>

<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> Why am I so unhappy?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your body is afraid of everything.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your vital complains about everything.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your mind wants everything<br /> To be explained.<br /> You are unhappy because<br /> Your heart does not trust anything."</p>
<p>My Supreme Lord,<br /> How can I be happy?</p>
<p>"My child,<br /> You can be happy easily,<br /> Effectively and permanently<br /> If you can think and feel<br /> That you are of<br /> The transcendentally beautiful Reality,<br /> God,<br /> And that you are for<br /> The universally fruitful Reality, God."</p>

<p>There was a time when my Lord Supreme<br /> Came to me with His Forgiveness<br /> In infinite measure.<br /> Alas, soon He came to realise<br /> That I did not deserve His Forgiveness.<br /> Therefore, He was compelled to withdraw<br /> His Forgiveness.</p>

<p>Now my Lord Supreme says to me,<br /> "O useless seeker,<br /> From now on I shall come to you<br /> With My Justice-Light,<br /> Which is, indeed, another way<br /> Of expressing My Concern for you.</p>
<p>"But if you fail even this time,<br /> Then I am going to use<br /> My most powerful weapon:<br /> My Indifference.<br /> Of all My weapons,<br /> My Indifference is by far<br /> The most destructive.<br /> Be careful, be careful, be careful,<br /> O useless seeker!"</p>
