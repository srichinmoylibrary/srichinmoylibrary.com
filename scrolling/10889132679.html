  <h2 id="page-title">Surrender and capacity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Surrender and capacity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>If you have the capacity to do something, then the capacity itself will grow into confidence. Today you may not have confidence. But if you practise, confidence is bound to be developed. Even if I feel that I won't be the fastest runner, my very practising can bring me the capacity to run. Then confidence will come.</p>
<p>It may be true that sometimes you have the capacity but no confidence. You may be afraid of failing and then you become nervous. In the spiritual life also we see it happen. We need an unconditionally surrendered disciple. Some people do not understand what an unconditionally surrendered disciple is. They think that he is a fool, that his mind is not developed, that he is nothing. But this is all wrong. Only when one makes unconditional surrender does a person become perfect. Somebody may have no mind or he may not have developed some other quality which you and others call important. But in our path, what is most important is this unconditional surrender. Even if a disciple has nothing else to show in the outer world, if he has made unconditional surrender, then I wish to say that that disciple becomes perfect. Somebody will think, "Oh, his mind is not developed, his talents are not developed." But I wish to say that this is the wrong idea. First make unconditional surrender, and then the other things that you feel are necessary, if they are necessary at all, will be given to you in boundless measure.</p>
<p>Let us say that the world has accepted you because you have done something marvellous, something very great. You may feel that if you give unconditional surrender, then I will be able to make something great out of your achievement. But you are cherishing a wrong theory. I need only the person whom I can mould according to my own way, according to the Supreme's Way. If the individual is very malleable, then he can be a real, unconditionally surrendered disciple. That person need not have any outer qualification, any outer achievement. The world will appreciate your outer achievements, but I will appreciate your ability to let me mould you the way the Supreme wants me to mould you. So outer achievement is no achievement in this case. Some disciples say, "If I make unconditional surrender, I will lose so much," or "I have studied so many books, so my unconditional surrender will be most striking." But I wish to say that if you know so many things, if you have, say, a very developed mind, then you will have to unlearn many things in order to make unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>Again, if you come with outer achievement and make yourself totally, unconditionally surrendered, naturally, all the qualities that you have will be utilised by the divine Will. Those qualities I will not negate. I will not say that they are useless. No, I can use them. Previously you used them for a different purpose: for your own benefit, your own joy and pleasure. Now you will be using them under the divine guidance for a divine cause. So we will not negate the human qualities. Again, if somebody does not have outer achievement and if that person becomes truly surrendered, I wish to say that I will be able to mould him in my own way like a lump of clay that is not yet formed. Then that person becomes my most important, invaluable instrument.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Questions and answers</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Questions and answers" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: I'm not a follower of your path, but sometimes I think of the path of devotion and surrender, and when I do, my head seems to fight it very strongly. It says, "No, you cannot surrender," because I don't feel as if I know exactly what it is that I am surrendering to, and it makes me feel that I am being blind in a way.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You need not follow our path, but only I wish to make it clear to you that surrender, if it is properly understood, is the easiest thing. But if it is not properly understood, then it is the most difficult thing on earth. In this world, when we live in the physical consciousness, we never want to surrender to another person. But how many times a day do we surrender to the ignorance inside ourselves in spite of knowing that we are doing something wrong? We feel, "All right, we are helpless," and we surrender. The higher mind tells us that we are doing something wrong, but the higher mind surrenders because of its oneness with the lower mind.</p>
<p>Many things are like this. Suppose a friend of yours is doing something wrong, and he is asking you for a favour. What do you do? You do it, became he is your friend, after all.</p>
<p>But now let us take only the positive side. If we feel that the entire body belongs to us, then we will claim our head as our own and our feet also we will claim as our own. Now it may happen that I feel that my head has something which my feet do not have. Let us say that my head has illumination. It is difficult for the head to have illumination before the heart, but let us say that the head is higher than the feet. So the head has got some wealth. I claim my head as my own and I claim my feet also as my own. Is it beneath the dignity of my feet to grab the very thing that my head is more than eager to give to my feet? No, head and feet are one. This moment I need the help of my head, then the next moment I need the help of my feet. Just because I have established my oneness, conscious oneness, with my feet and with my head, I am getting their wealth. So this is real wisdom.</p>
<p>I may have something valuable in my safe, which is in my bedroom, let us say. I do not keep it in my kitchen. If I keep my money in my safe, in my bedroom, then naturally I will go there when I need money. I know it is my money, so for me to go upstairs and collect the money is not beneath my dignity. At that time I am not surrendering, only I have the wisdom to go to the right place where I have kept my money, my treasure.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we surrender to God, we surrender to our highest part, for God is our most illumined part. We can't separate God from our existence. If we feel that God and we are one, then God is our most illumined part, let us say, and we are right now unillumined. We are clever, we are wise. We know that the person who has been illumined, who is all-illumination, is also part and parcel of our entire existence, so we go there and receive from Him. If we take surrender in that way, then there is no problem.</p>
<p>But if we take surrender as the surrender of a slave to his master, then we will never be able to feel our oneness. The slave surrenders to his master out of fear. He is afraid that his service will be dispensed with if he does not do his job well. He feels that no matter what he has done, even if he has done everything for the master soulfully, devotedly, even unconditionally, still there is no guarantee that the master will give him what he wants or that the master will really please him. If it is an ordinary human being and if he has a few slaves, then he will get whatever he wants from his slaves; but when it is a matter of his own self-giving, he may be millions of miles away from their needs. But when we offer our existence to God, we have the feeling of oneness between Father and son or Mother and son. The little child always feels that what his father has is his own. His father has a car. The child is only three years old, but he says, "I have a car." He does not have to say, "My father has a car." He will simply say, "It is my car, our car."</p>
<p>So if we change our understanding of our relationship with God, then there is no problem. If He has Peace, then we have every right to claim His Peace as our own. He is our Father, so we can inherit it. Because God is our Father, because God is our Mother, we can have that kind of feeling. If we feel that we are God's slaves and He is our Lord Supreme, that we are at His Feet and we will have to do everything for Him, then we have no inner feeling, no assurance, no guarantee that He will please us. But if we have the feeling of oneness between Father and son, between Mother and child, then where is the problem? There is no problem because we know that what the mother or the father has, the child has every right to claim as his very own. So the child at that time does not surrender. He only claims, legitimately claims, his mother's wealth or his father's wealth as his very own.</p>
<p>We don't surrender anything; only we become aware of the fact that we belong to someone who has everything. We just go and claim it and possess it at any moment. For the feet to feel their oneness with the head is not at all difficult because the feet know that the head also very often needs help from the feet. Similarly, when we aspire, we come to feel that God needs us equally. As we need Him to realise the Highest, the Absolute Truth, so He also needs us for His Manifestation. For our realisation we need Him badly; for His Manifestation, perfect Manifestation, He needs us. Without us He does not manifest or cannot manifest. So, if it is not beneath God's dignity to take a little help from ignorant people for His Manifestation on earth, then how can it be beneath our dignity to ask God to give us a little Peace, Light and Bliss?</p>
<p>We have to establish our conscious oneness with God. Then there is no surrender. It is only mutual give and take. What the feet have to offer, the head takes gladly and vice versa. In the spiritual life we give God our aspiration and He gives us His Realisation. We give Him what we have and He gives us what He has and is. So in this way we don't surrender, only we offer our mutual achievements and we claim each other as our very own.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak a little bit about will-power and surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak a little bit about will-power and surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, divine surrender comes from will-power. Now, if we have will-power, adamantine will-power, then we will get the capacity to have unconditional surrender. Again, if we can surrender unconditionally, then we develop will-power. Inner will-power, which is the soul's light, and surrender, which is the heart's oneness with the Absolute, go together. There is no difference between the soul's will-power and unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme. Both of them are equally strong. If one can make unconditional surrender to the Will of the Supreme, that means it is the result of one's inner will-power, the soul's light.</p>
<p>Without will-power one cannot make unconditional surrender; it will be all compromise. God will do something for us and in return we will do something for God. Naturally there are people who do not do anything for God and do not expect anything from God. But again, there are people who feel that if they do something, then God is bound to do something else for them.</p>
<p>When we pray, we feel that God will listen to our prayer. When we meditate, we feel that we will have Peace, Light and Bliss, which is an absolutely true and legitimate claim. But when we pray, when we meditate, we have to feel that it is our business to pray and meditate and it is God's business either to give us Peace or not to give us anything. We have to come to that kind of surrender. We shall play our part by praying and meditating; that is our task. God's task is to feed us with His Light, Peace and Bliss. But He knows the right moment. So if we can meditate, and during our meditation if we have the feeling that we shall not expect anything — that if Peace, Light and Bliss enter into us, well and good, if not, then we will be equally satisfied — then this will be the best type of meditation. We shall meditate because we feel that that is the only way we can become inseparably one with God.</p>
<p>So to come back to your question, will-power and the surrender of the entire being always go together. They are inseparable. To surrender unconditionally to someone takes tremendous will-power. We find it so difficult to obey our superior although we say, "He is my superior." We accept it theoretically, but when it comes to practical life, immediately we revolt, because we feel that we know better than he does. In the spiritual life, our Guru is our superior. But the real Guru is the Supreme. At every moment we have to feel that our Guru, who is the Supreme, knows infinitely better than we do. Then we have to surrender to His Will, not to our so-called conviction. If one can surrender to the Will of the Supreme, then it is as good as having tremendous will-power. There is no difference between soul's will and life's dedicated surrender.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Humility</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Humility" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once in India a spiritual Master asked a group of his disciples the distance between man and God. One disciple stood up and said to the spiritual Master, "Please, Master, just wait." Then he took seven bold steps from where he was sitting to the feet of the Master. After counting these steps, the disciple declared, "The distance between man and God is only seven steps."</p>
<p>A few days later, the same spiritual Master was asked by a student a dry, complicated, philosophical question, full of Indian jargon. The Master said, "Since it is dry philosophy, I shall not be able to answer this question. It is too mental, too intellectual." Then he pointed to a philosopher disciple of his and said, "He will answer the question." For this disciple to have answered that question would have been absolutely nothing; it would have been like drinking water. But he came up with folded hands and said to the questioner, "How do you expect the son to answer the question when the father cannot answer the question? If my Master cannot answer the question, then I cannot answer it either. It is impossible." So here is humility. There were many in that group who would have been all too eager to come up and answer the questions on the Master's behalf. But the Master wanted to teach them humility, so he picked the right person.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we live more with humility?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we live more with humility?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can live more with humility provided we know what we can offer when we really become humble. When we become really humble, we offer more of our capacity, divinity and reality. Only by becoming humble can we become what we truly are. We become of greater use, of greater help to mankind.</p>
<p>We can observe a tree. When the tree does not have fruits, it just remains straight, erect. But when the tree bears fruit, it bends down. The presence of the fruit means light and nourishment. But do we appreciate, do we admire the tree that is not willing to offer its fruits to us? Similarly when we have the fruits called Peace, Light and Bliss, we just come down to aspiring humanity. When aspiring humanity receives our Peace, Light and Bliss, we become of great service to mankind.</p>
<p>Humility we have to take as a divine gift and a supreme gift. It is something that we have to offer to mankind. We have to feel that humility is our feeling of consecrated oneness with humanity. If we take humility in the highest and purest sense of the term, then we can become really humble. Humility is not a matter of touching the feet of somebody, no. It is something that has to be shared with the rest of the world. It is the God-life within us. The higher we go, the greater is our promise to the Supreme in mankind. The more light we receive by virtue of our humility, the more we have to offer to mankind.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that there is only one way to become humble and that is to see what happens to an individual when he sees, achieves and grows into the light. Does he keep it all for himself? No. He shares with the rest of the world. And when he shares, the world is nourished, the world is fulfilled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a spiritual way to be defeated by someone?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a spiritual way to be defeated by someone?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are defeated, if you have an admiring attitude, then automatically your admiration is a magnet. You are pulling into your own system the qualities that you appreciate inwardly. Outwardly you may make that person feel that what he has is something unacceptable, but inwardly you feel it is something you need; so admiration itself is playing the role of a magnet. When you admire someone, automatically you get something from him.</p>
<p>Admiration on the physical level means forgetfulness of what you have. When you feel that something unlimited can exist, then you forget that you have limitations. You forget that the things you are appreciating in someone else are limited. You are appreciating the unlimited consciousness in him, and he sympathises with you because he feels that he also needs the unlimited consciousness.</p>
<p>In this world everybody feels happy when he is wanted and needed. When the unlimited feels wanted, it comes closer. When it feels special concern or when it feels that one person cares more for it than others, then naturally it feels that God will care more for that person. Here the unlimited consciousness is like the sunlight. The sunlight is there for everyone, but only if we want to use it can it come to us to be of service. If we don't need it, then why should it come to us?</p>

You meditate early in the morning for five minutes and then you say, "Oh, I have meditated." You feel that you have played your part. The rest of the day you spend time in your own way. But here there is no aspiration, no devotion, no inner cry. Out of twenty-four hours you could easily have used at least three or four hours for God. Certainly you have to sleep, you have to go to your office, you have to go to school. So for you to spend twelve hours on God may be impossible. But if you can spend at least three hours in spiritual activities — meditation, reading spiritual books, doing selfless service, mixing with spiritual people and coming to the Centre regularly — then that is called self-offering.</p>
<p>Right now, out of twenty-four hours you give five minutes in the morning and five minutes in the evening and then you feel, "Oh, God has to do everything for me because I have dedicated myself." But look at your sincerity. Ten minutes you have given to God and you are claiming God for your own use for twenty-four hours. This is no self-offering. You have to know how you can give your utmost to God. Your utmost may be three hours or four hours or it may be more.</p>
<p>If you have ten dollars, then out of ten dollars whatever you are in a position to give wholeheartedly and devotedly is called your self-offering. In your aspiration, in your concentration and in your meditation also you have to try your utmost. Then only the Supreme will feel that you are trying to dedicate yourself. If your utmost capacity in meditation is, say, a total of three hours during the morning, afternoon, evening and night, then those three hours will be considered as your true dedication. If you know how to do something well, then for five minutes if you do it and the rest of the day you don't think of it, that is not dedication. You have to know your utmost capacity and then you have to exercise that capacity.</p>
<p>When you dedicate yourself, you have to feel that this moment you could have done something else. You could have gone to the movies, you could have gone to a party, you could have done something silly, but instead you have spent that time in meditation, in prayer, in doing spiritual things. So always you have to know what you are doing with time. Each moment you can utilise for God, for the Supreme, or for your own purpose. The time that is passing by is not going to come back. Today, the twenty-seventh of December, nineteen hundred seventy-one, is not going to come back, it is gone. Tomorrow will come in the calendar, but today's slipping time, today's fleeting breath is gone away. You have to know how much time you have used today to please the Supreme in you and how much time you have used to please your unlit self.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sacrifice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sacrifice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I wish to give a short talk on sacrifice. There are two types of sacrifice: earthly sacrifice and heavenly sacrifice, material sacrifice and spiritual sacrifice. Material sacrifice we all know very well: we give money, or we give material objects to others. But spiritual sacrifice is something else. In spiritual sacrifice we give Peace, Bliss, inner Power and other divine qualities. Undoubtedly, spiritual sacrifice is far more important than material sacrifice. Material sacrifice does not demand much concentration. If you don't like something you have, such as a piece of furniture, then you can give it away. But if you want to offer Peace to somebody else, then you have to pray and meditate for a long, long time so that you can acquire this peace within you.</p>
<p>Human sacrifice ascends. Divine sacrifice descends. When God or the cosmic gods sacrifice something for us, they have to descend. When we want to sacrifice something for them, we ascend. We ascend with our aspiration and God descends with His Compassion. But when we sacrifice something to God, we have to feel that whatever we sacrifice has already been sacrificed by God Himself to us and for us. On our behalf, the spiritual Masters give to God what He has already given us.</p>
<p>When we make a sacrifice, what do we actually do? We invite the vast in our earthly existence to come to the fore. Always sacrifice means the invocation of the vast in our human nature. When we invoke the infinite vast, it will enter into us. At that time we have to give up our imperfections, limitations and bondage. After we make a sacrifice, what do we see, what do we feel? We feel only one thing: love. If we have divine love, then we also have the capacity to express it. There are many things that we have, but we do not or cannot express them. But in the case of divine love, if we really have it, then we have to express it. The expression is always spontaneous. If we have money, then it is up to us whether or not we shall give it to others. If we have any material objects, it is up to us whether to give or not to give them. We can hold them back if we want to. But the very nature of divine love is expression. If we really have divine love, we cannot hide it; we cannot keep it for ourselves. Always it has to flow from within.</p>
<p>If we, as human beings, want to be transformed into divine beings, we have to see and feel the necessity of divine sacrifice on earth. Now, how are we going to know if this sacrifice of ours is complete? We can know that it is complete the moment we feel that by giving we are not only getting more, but becoming complete. Sacrifice takes the form of love, and this love is oneness. The mother gives to her child all that she has, wholeheartedly. When we give a little peace or joy to others and we feel that we still have more inside us, then we have to feel that we have not made the other person complete, and at the same time we have not made ourselves complete. When we offer our peace, love and bliss to another person fully and wholeheartedly, then only can our vessel be filled to the brim. God Himself will fill it for us.</p>
<p>We can start with material sacrifice, and we can end with spiritual sacrifice. If we cannot make material sacrifice, which is infinitely easier than spiritual sacrifice, then it is simply absurd to say that we have made the complete spiritual sacrifice. In the material sacrifice we are involved with earthly time, which means working for ten minutes or an hour. When somebody is asked to do dedicated service for the spiritual Centre, for the Mission, if he says that he cannot do it because he is busy doing this or that, then naturally he is not making a sacrifice. If this same person is asked by his spiritual Master to make a spiritual sacrifice by meditating for two hours, three hours or twelve hours at a time for God's sake, he will never be able to do it. He could not even do the easiest thing, which is to offer a few minutes or a few hours to do something on the physical plane. Others also could have done this devoted service, but only one particular disciple was given the opportunity. This opportunity is a real blessing. If at that time the person refuses or is not co-operative, then the opportunity is taken away and we have to feel that the Master's concern for the disciple has also gone away. When this concern goes away, then everything is gone. We start with opportunity. Then, when we go a little farther, it becomes concern. When concern is refused, nothing remains. Then the disciple has to take the responsibility for what he wants to do.</p>
<p>Each individual seeker gets the golden opportunity to make a spiritual sacrifice. This spiritual sacrifice is his aspiration for one minute, two minutes, five minutes or ten minutes. For a human being, aspiration-sacrifice is greater than material sacrifice. What a human being has is a bundle of desires. If he can minimise his desires, then aspiration is bound to loom large in him. When aspiration starts functioning in a human being, then he is really making a sacrifice of his limited being to the unlimited Supreme Being. We have to feel that it is in sacrifice that we can get joy. We get satisfaction not by possessing, but by becoming one. When we possess, we can never become one. We have the sense of separativity. But when we offer ourselves to others, then we really become one with them.</p>
<p>When an individual offers himself to the earth-consciousness, he does not retain his individuality any longer. He becomes the collective possession of humanity. At that moment God can be proud of His entire creation. Each human being has the capacity to make God proud of His creation. At the same time, we also have the capacity to make God suffer because of our ignorance, imperfections, limitations and bondage. God is our divine Father. He can never be indifferent to our activities. He is infinitely sweeter and dearer than our human father. God's concern is His sacrifice for us and our concern is our sacrifice for humanity and divinity.</p>
<p>Here we are all sincere seekers. We all have the capacity to make God happy in our daily actions, and for that we need first of all one divine sacrifice: our early morning meditation. We can meditate at two o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock or ten o'clock, but we have to feel the necessity of meditation. Your meditation is your inner discovery. If we meditate well daily, then we can feel that it is not only a discovery, but an invention. We discover things which already exist and we can also invent things, for God is constantly creating Himself in His infinite plenitude. So we also have the capacity on the strength of our oneness, inseparable oneness with God, to create divine qualities with our sacrifice.</p>
