  <h2 id="page-title">Patience illumines</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Patience illumines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were two sisters, Kadru and Binate, who were both married to the sage Kashyapa. The sisters were extremely fond of each other. Kashyapa used to spend most of his time in meditation while his wives did the housework. Everything they sacrificed gladly, and Kashyapa was very pleased to have them as his wives.</p>
<p>Once, Kashyapa left for a few days of serious meditation. While he was away, the two sisters were talking, when unfortunately they entered into a serious dispute over the colour of Indra's elephant, Oirabat. Binate said it was white while Kadru said it was black. Each was so certain of being right that both agreed that whoever was wrong would become the slave of the other. This was the agreement they came to.</p>
<p>Kadru, who had three sons, asked them about that particular elephant. "You have seen Indra's Oirabat so many times. Can you tell me the colour of that elephant?"</p>
<p>The sons said, "Yes, Mother, it is white, pure white, like the moon."</p>
<p>Kadru cried out, "O God, what have I done? Now I have to become the slave of my sister. Save me, save me!"</p>
<p>"How can we save you?" they asked. "Why did you make that kind of promise? We are extremely sorry, and we will feel very miserable when you become Mother Binate's maid, but we are helpless."</p>
<p>"You are not helpless," Kadru said. "Do me a favour. Tomorrow morning Indra's elephant will come to the lake. You and a few friends must wear black garments and carry black pieces of cloth with you. Then, when the elephant starts approaching, cover it with the black. When Binate and I come to see it, I will say, 'Look, it is definitely black.' We will hear the sound of the elephant, but from a distance it will look black."</p>
<p>Early in the morning while it was still somewhat dark, the elephant came to the lake. Binate saw the pieces of cloth in front of the elephant. "Yes, it is black," she cried out. "I have lost!"</p>
<p>Kadru said, "Now you have to be my slave, my maidservant, for life."</p>
<p>When Kashyapa returned from his few days of meditation, he saw that Binate had become Kadru's slave and was sad and miserable. Kashyapa himself felt so sad. "How can this kind of thing happen?" he asked.</p>
<p>When Kashyapa heard all about it, he said to Binate, "Kadru's sons have deceived you. Actually, the elephant is white."</p>
<p>Binate could not believe her ears. "I am so sad to hear that my dear sister Kadru and her sons have deceived me. But now it is too late. I have committed myself to being her slave. A promise is a promise."</p>
<p>Kashyapa said, "Binate, you should have had more patience and waited for the elephant to come nearer. Then you would have discovered their trick and not committed yourself to be her slave forever."</p>
<p>Binate cried, "What shall I do now?"</p>
<p>"Wait for the hour," Kashyapa consoled her. "Although it is unfair, be patient. One day you will also have one or two sons. Your children will either take revenge or do something to illumine Kadru and her sons and make the family happy again."</p>
<p>In three or four years Binate was blessed with a child, but the birth was premature. Binate became very upset: "This is the result of my patience?" she cried. "How can I have a premature child? This child is supposed to save me. It is impossible." In her anger she kicked the child and the child became deformed.</p>
<p>"What have I done? What have I done?" she screamed.</p>
<p>Again Kashyapa consoled her. "You should have had more faith in my prophecy. Still my prophecy will one day prove true. Have patience: wait and see. Your sons will save you."</p>
<p>"I don't need any more children," she said. "I am ready to remain all the time a slave to my sister."</p>
<p>When her son was still very young, he said to Binate, "Mother, I fully understand that the reason you kicked me was because you were mad with grief. Torture yourself no longer about what you have done, and do not feel sad that you have become your own sister's slave. First Kadru and you were sisters, then you were married to the same sage. You were very happy, and now your life is all suffering and misery. But a time will come when you will be free from this bondage."</p>
<p>Two years later, Binate was blessed with another son, Arun, who was extremely bright spiritually. Binate was very happy to have this son.</p>
<p>Kashyapa said, "This son will really help you."</p>
<p>Indeed, the brightness of the child frightened and tortured Kadru and her children and they were terribly jealous of him. As Arun grew older, his illumination compelled the stepbrothers to surrender, and they began leading a divine life.</p>
<p>One day Binate said to her son, "Arun, I know you have the power to compel my sister to free me from my promise. But please, let your older brother be cured by you instead. I am ready to remain a slave forever."</p>
<p>But his older brother said to Arun, "No, I am ready to remain deformed. Let my mother be freed. You must not save me; save my mother."</p>
<p>Arun replied, "There is no reason why you, Mother, have to remain a slave. My stepbrothers have become divine. Kadru, too, is ready to receive illumination."</p>
<p>Very soon, Kadru freed Binate from her old promise, and again the two sisters became very close. The stepbrothers and brothers also became very fond of each other, and in a short time the oldest son of Binate was cured.</p>
<p>Kashyapa said, "Because of your patience, Binate, one of your sons has freed you, as I predicted. He has transformed and illumined Kadru and her sons. You lost the feeling of oneness over an elephant. But the past is dust. Now let us again enjoy the happiness of a oneness-family."</p>
<p>Immediately Indra's elephant Oirabat appeared outside Kashyapa's home, and his two wives bowed down at the sage's feet: "O Kashyapa, O great sage, we clearly see now that in spite of our ignorance you have illumined us. You have shown us that patience illumines and oneness ever lives in the heart of God's creation."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Goddess Ganga descends to earth</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Goddess Ganga descends to earth" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The greatest of all sacrificial rites is Ashwamedha, the horse sacrifice. In performing Ashwamedha, the owner of a horse will meditate most soulfully and offer some mantras to the horse. Then he will allow the horse to leave his home and roam all over the countryside. The owner has to fight with whoever captures the horse and bring him back. Then only the sacrifice can take place.</p>
<p>Once a great king named Sagar wanted to perform this rite. Already King Sagar had performed Ashwamedha ninety-nine times and this was to be his hundredth time. Indra, the King of the Gods, had only been able to perform this particular sacrifice one hundred times, and he became terribly jealous of the King.</p>
<p>Since Indra wanted to ruin the King's sacrifice, he stole the horse. Sagar sent his son, with a large army, to find the culprit and Indra was afraid he would be caught. So he entered into the nether world, first tying up the horse near a great sage who was meditating. After some time, Sagar's soldiers saw the animal near the sage, and they thought it was the sage who had stolen the horse.</p>
<p>The soldiers said, "This sage is so unwise to keep the horse tied so close to him. He should have at least let the horse go away. Now it is obvious who the thief is." So they started beating the sage most mercilessly. Suddenly the sage opened up his third eye and in a fleeting minute he killed Sagar's son and the entire army of six thousand soldiers.</p>
<p>When his son and the army did not return, King Sagar sent his grandson to find out where they were. The grandson looked for the horse and finally found the animal near the sage. The sage told him what had happened.</p>
<p>"Please, you have to return the horse," the boy said.</p>
<p>"No," said the sage. "Tell your grandfather, the King, that I won't tolerate this kind of thing. His soldiers struck me mercilessly, thinking I was the thief."</p>
<p>The boy asked, "O sage, what is to be done now? So many good men have died."</p>
<p>The sage replied, "Only if the river Ganga comes down from Heaven and touches these dead bodies with its water will they be revived. But for that you will have to pray and meditate for years."</p>
<p>The grandson returned to the King with the sad news. King Sagar immediately agreed to pray and meditate to please the Goddess Ganga. He began praying and meditating intensely, but in a few years' time he died.</p>
<p>Then the grandson, Angshuman, began meditating, but in a few years he also died. His son, Dilip, prayed and meditated for a few years and also died. Then his son, Bhagirath, also began praying and meditating most earnestly, and finally his prayer was heard by the Goddess Ganga.</p>
<p>Ganga appeared before him and said, "Before you, your father's father and also his grandfather all prayed to me. Their accumulated prayer and your prayer have touched the very depth of my heart; therefore, I am going to come down. But if I descend to earth with my tremendous speed, I will destroy the world. There has to be someone who is spiritually very great to hold back my speed and power, and that can only be Shiva."</p>
<p>Bhagirath then went and prayed to Shiva: "When Ganga descends most powerfully to rescue my family's army, please restrain the flow of her waters. Only you are powerful enough to perform this feat."</p>
<p>Shiva was very pleased with Bhagirath's prayer and he agreed. "I will hold her back with my matted hair."</p>
<p>When the Goddess Ganga began descending most powerfully, Shiva held her back with his matted hair. But his hair was so thick that Ganga's waters could not flow down to earth at all, and the dead bodies were not being revived.</p>
<p>So Shiva took out one of the hairs from his head so that the water could flow through. The flow was not as powerful as it would have been if Shiva had not interfered, but it was still very powerful. It descended and passed near a cottage of a sage named Jahnu, and began washing away his cottage.</p>
<p>The sage got mad and started drinking the water, until he had drunk the entire amount that had descended. So all the water entered into Jahnu and none of it touched the soldiers. Bhagirath begged Jahnu to release the water. So Jahnu emptied the water through his mouth and the river continued flowing. Finally it touched the spot where the dead bodies were.</p>
<p>As soon as the water touched them, all the soldiers revived. They were exactly the same age as when they had died.</p>
<p>Because of this story, other names of the Ganga are Jahnabi and Bhagirathi.</p>

<p>There was a very rich man who had a slave. One day the slave saved the rich man's only son from drowning. His master was extremely pleased with him and set him free. Not only that, but he also gave him lots of gifts and money plus a large sailing boat.</p>
<p>Now that the ex-slave had money, he hired some people to work his boat and set out on a voyage across the ocean.</p>
<p>Alas, one day there was a terrible cyclone. The boat sank and everybody drowned, except this former slave. He began swimming towards a nearby island. When he reached it, he saw that many people were waiting for him, crying with delight, "The King has come! The King has come!"</p>
<p>The man said, "Why are you calling me King? I have lost everything except this loin cloth that I am wearing."</p>
<p>Everyone said, "This year you will be King. Every year we have a new king. You are King for this year."</p>
<p>"But I don't understand," said the man.</p>
<p>"We appoint a new king every year and now it is your turn," they said.</p>
<p>"Why are you so kind to me?" he asked. Then he said to himself, "Perhaps God, out of His infinite Bounty, is doing this since I have lost my boat."</p>
<p>So he turned to the crowd and asked, "Tell me only one thing. Is it only for a year?"</p>
<p>"Yes," came the reply.</p>
<p>"Then what will happen?" he asked.</p>
<p>They said, "Well, we shall throw you off of the island."</p>
<p>He asked, "Then where shall I go?"</p>
<p>They answered, "We only know that the King rules for one year. Then he must leave the kingdom."</p>
<p>The ex-slave asked, "Please, send me the wisest man in the kingdom." When the man came, the new King asked, "Is it true that each king rules only for a year and then must leave the island? Then God alone knows what happens to him. Is there any advice you can give me so that at the end of a year I don't become a beggar again?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the wise man. "Now that you are King, try to make yourself another kingdom on a nearby island. Transform another island into a kingdom by sending your people to make roads, gardens, houses and so forth. Do everything in this one year. When you have established another kingdom, why do you have to worry? At the end of the year you can go there."</p>
<p>"How is it that my predecessors did not do this?" the man asked.</p>
<p>The wise man explained, "I told them, but they did not listen to me. They kept saying, 'In a few weeks we shall do it.' Then, two months before their reign was up, I used to tell them again, but they didn't think of their future."</p>
<p>The King said, "I will definitely listen to you. People will go find a new place where they will build another kingdom like this." The wise man said, "Will you do it, or will you have the same fate as your predecessors?"</p>
<p>"No," said the King, "I won't allow myself to have the same fate. I will start from today to send people to do the needful.</p>
<p>"Always we have to think of the future. Always we have to remember that the future grows in the present. If there is a gap between the present and the future, if we do not think of the future, then some calamity will always take place."</p>
<p>So the King sent out his subjects to build a new kingdom, and at the end of a year, the King went there and started ruling it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The poet and the King</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The poet and the King" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a King who used to appreciate poets and learned men in his kingdom. He would always shower gifts upon them and hold various contests in which he would give them awards.</p>
<p>There happened to be a poor poet who was poor not only in his outer life but also in his poetry. Everybody used to go to the palace and recite poems they had written about the King, and appreciate and flatter the King. But this particular poet would not or could not go.</p>
<p>His wife was very upset over this, and she kept telling him, "One day you have to go. How long can we remain poor? We have children, and we cannot meet with our expenses. You must go!"</p>
<p>The poet did not want to anger his wife because she had a bad temper and he was afraid she might do something drastic. So he went to the King and said, "I have written an excellent poem on you."</p>
<p>The King said, "All right, leave it here and come back tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow?" the poet asked. "You won't read it today?"</p>
<p>"No, tomorrow," the King said.</p>
<p>The following day, when the poet returned to the palace, the King was giving away alms to the poor. Many people were standing in line, and each one came up and received something from the King. Then the King started calling the poets to come to him. But the King did not call out the name of this particular poet. The poet was puzzled and surprised, but he did not know what to do.</p>
<p>At long last the King turned to this particular poet and said, "I have given my alms for today. It is all over. We have had a wonderful meeting and everything is all over. You go home and take a shower and have something to eat."</p>
<p>The poet said, "When shall I come again?"</p>
<p>The King said, "Why will you have to come again? Don't you have a copy of the poem which you have left me? When I have time, I just read the poems. I have already read your poem. It is not necessary for you to come back."</p>
<p>The poet said, "Lord, Lord, I am very poor."</p>
<p>The King said, "I know you are very poor. You told me some sweet words in your poem, and I am also telling you some sweet words: please go home, take a shower and eat."</p>
<p>The poet said, "I have come here not to have appreciation for my poems, O great and rich man. I have come for something else."</p>
<p>"O poet," the King said, "your poem was beautiful, the metre was perfect, everything that a good poem needs your poem had in every way. Your poem about me was perfect. You have tremendous capacity, but you should not waste your capacity in writing such beautiful poems about a human being. You must write about God. He is the Creator, the Almighty. You have got divine capacity so you have to utilise it only for God. This kind of flattery I don't deserve. If it is sincere then I don't deserve it. If it is flattery, I don't need it. Only God deserves this kind of praise, and infinitely more. Since you have the capacity, you write about God; write about the Supreme Poet Himself. By writing about Him, you will get more capacity and you will write infinitely better poems." The King then threw away the poem which the poet had written about him.</p>
<p>The poor poet said to himself, "Alas, alas what am I going to tell my wife? To please her I came. To make her rich, I came. Now I have not got a rupee from the King. O God, bad luck is everywhere. He who is cursed with bad luck will have the same fate everywhere, for bad luck knows how to dog a human's fate."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The golden swan</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The golden swan" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Buddha told this story as something that took place in one of his previous incarnations. At that time, he was a simple man with a wife and three daughters. He was always kind to people and was dearly loved by his family. Unfortunately, he died before he could marry his daughters so he felt very sad. When he entered into the soul's world, he observed what was happening on earth, and saw that his family was almost poverty-stricken.</p>
<p>So he returned to his family as a beautiful golden swan and said to his wife, "I have come to you in this form. Once a month I shall come and leave one of my gold feathers for you to sell. In this way you will easily be able to meet with all your expenses."</p>
<p>So every month he used to come and leave a golden feather.</p>
<p>The wife was very happy, and the daughters also were so delighted when they saw their father. The swan used to stay for a few minutes and then leave.</p>
<p>One day an idea entered into the wife's mind: "My husband may not come regularly, or he may change his mind and stop coming, or he may grow old and die. The best thing is for me to catch him and strangle him the next time he comes, so that I can take away all his feathers."</p>
<p>The daughters were simply shocked: "How can you do this kind of thing, Mother?"</p>
<p>The wife said, "All right, I won't strangle him. But I will take away all his feathers. If he cannot fly anymore, no harm. You will take care of your father."</p>
<p>The daughters pleaded with their mother, "Please, we love our father so deeply. He is so kind to us. He could have stayed in the soul's world, but he comes in the form of a swan to help. Look at his love for us."</p>
<p>But the mother would not listen. The next time the bird came, she caught hold of him by the neck and took away all his feathers, one by one.</p>
<p>It was most painful to the swan and he cried and screamed most pitifully: "What are you doing? I have been so kind to you."</p>
<p>When she was finished, the bird was suffering like anything and it could not fly anymore. Then all of a sudden all the golden feathers turned into ordinary white feathers: they no longer were made of gold.</p>
<p>The greedy wife felt miserable and the daughters were smitten with grief. But what could the daughters do? Their mother was so cruel. Then the mother went inside her room and opened a box where she had been keeping the gold feathers that she had accumulated but had not yet sold. She knew that she still had many gold feathers, enough to meet her family's expenses for at least six months. But as soon as she opened the box, she found that these feathers, too, had turned into ordinary white feathers; they were no longer gold.</p>
<p>The three daughters, with great love and affection, each day fed the poor swan and showed him tremendous concern. The mother was now helpless; she hated her fate. "This is what happened because of my greed," she said to herself.</p>
<p>The daughters said to her, "This is what you have done! Even if our father had not come for six months or one year, we could have lived comfortably on the golden feathers that you had saved in your box. Now father does not have golden feathers anymore."</p>
<p>The father said, "This is your fate, my fate."</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily the feathers of the swan grew back again, but this time they were pure white, so the wife did not bother to take them from the bird. Finally the bird was able to fly away. The children were very happy that the bird was released. Now their father would be happy. They said, "He will be able to do everything in his own way."</p>
<p>The mother felt miserable, not because the bird had gone away, but because of her stupidity. She was not going to get any more golden feathers and once again she was poor.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">King Amar and God&#039;s inscrutable ways</h2><span property="dc:title" content="King Amar and God&#039;s inscrutable ways" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a king named Amar. One day he said to his commander, "Take ten thousand soldiers and go attack King Jaghen. Seize him and bring him to me."</p>
<p>The commander said, "Would you allow me to ask you one question?"</p>
<p>The King said, "No, I have no time. Go immediately! Everybody appreciates him and admires him. His very name torments me. I won't kill him, but I will keep him in prison for life. Life-imprisonment he will get in my palace."</p>
<p>The commander was sad to hear the King's request, but he had to follow his orders. He took ten thousand soldiers and went to the other king's kingdom. For seven days he fought with the soldiers of King Jaghen and finally he defeated them. As the commander was about to bring the captured King back to King Amar, all of a sudden the Queen approached him. She placed her right hand on the commander's shoulder and said, "My son." She said it with such affection that the commander's heart melted.</p>
<p>"What would you like?" the commander asked.</p>
<p>The Queen replied, "My son, please do me a favour. Just release your father. Take him to the King, but not in chains. You are such a brave hero. You have defeated us and now we are at your mercy. But please treat us well. Take us to your palace, and we shall definitely abide by your King's will since we have surrendered to him. My son, I do not want your father to go to King Amar in chains."</p>
<p>The words, "My son," conquered the commander's heart. "You have called me your son. How can a son do this kind of thing? You are my mother. I am leaving your husband, my father, here. Whatever happens to me, my fate I will gladly accept."</p>
<p>So he came back to the King alone, without King Jaghen. King Amar got furious: "Where is he? Where is King Jaghen? How did you come back without him? I was told that you had won the battle."</p>
<p>The commander replied, "Yes, I have won, but I could not bring the King because the Queen called me her son. There was such sincere affection and love in her voice. I didn't have the heart to bring her husband, who is now my father."</p>
<p>King Amar mocked at the commander, "Oh, I see. You have a new father, a new mother. All right, let your parents take care of you. You shall be imprisoned for seven days, and on the eighth day I shall kill you. Let me see how your mother, who has conquered your heart, can save you now."</p>
<p>The commander said, "If my mother cannot save me, no harm. She has such affection for me and I have such affection for her."</p>
<p>One of the soldiers, who was extremely fond of the commander, became sad and mad. He was sad because his chief was going to be killed and mad because that old lady, the Queen had come with such affection that the commander did not arrest King Jaghen. So the soldier went to King Jaghen's palace and said to the Queen, "Look what you have done. The commander will be hanged on the eighth day because he could not take your husband."</p>
<p>The Queen said, "I wanted him to take my husband, but not in chains. I said we would gladly abide by his King's decision. But he did not take us. We shall eternally remain grateful to him and we shall pray to God for his safety."</p>
<p>The soldier said, "Yes, yes, you will pray."</p>
<p>"Yes, we shall pray," the Queen assured him. "Believe me."</p>
<p>The soldier said, "All right, then, I will believe you," and he returned to his kingdom without saying anything to the commander.</p>
<p>The Queen of Jaghen was extremely sad. "Because of me, this commander is going to die. Love is so good; again, love can create such problems. Because of his love for me, the commander did not arrest my husband. I have to do something."</p>
<p>The Queen went to the palace of another King who happened to be their friend. This King was infinitely more powerful than King Amar, and his Queen was her good friend. The Queen of Jaghen said to her friend, the other Queen, "Sister, save me, save me! Save my life!"</p>
<p>The Queen said, "I shall do anything you want me to."</p>
<p>The Queen of Jaghen said, "I want you to save my son."</p>
<p>"Your son? asked her friend. "What has happened to him?"</p>
<p>"I have adopted a son," the Queen of Jaghen explained. "He was so kind to me. He came and attacked our Kingdom and arrested my husband and was going to take him to King Amar. I asked the commander to remove the chains and I told him that we would abide by King Amar's wishes. But because I called him 'son' with such affection, he not only listened to me, but he would not take my husband back to Amar. Now King Amar is angry and wants to kill him. He will be hanged in a few days' time. Please help me. I really want to save him."</p>
<p>"Don't worry," her friend said. "I will be able to help you. Your commander-son will be saved. King Amar is deeply in love with my daughter, but my husband and I do not like him at all. Therefore, we have not given permission to our daughter to marry him. My daughter loves him also, but she does not want to displease us for we are so fond of her. But now we will give our daughter permission to marry him on condition that he set the commander free."</p>
<p>"We are not afraid of him at all because we are much more powerful than he is; that's why he did not dare attack us when we refused to give him our daughter. Now we will tell him we will give him our daughter provided he release his commander. If the commander wants to continue to serve him, that is up to the commander; but King Amar must set him free."</p>
<p>At the Queen's request, the King sent a messenger to King Amar saying, "We are prepared to give our daughter to you, but on one condition: you have to set your commander free."</p>
<p>As soon as King Amar read the letter, he was so delighted and excited that he ran into the room where the commander was and personally released him. "Now my desire is finally going to be fulfilled. In comparison to what I am getting, setting you free is nothing. Now you go your own way. If you want to go to the other Queen who called you her son, you can go and be her commander. Of if you want to stay here, you are totally free to do so. For me to get this princess as my wife is to get everything. She is so beautiful, inwardly and outwardly. I didn't dare to fight her father knowing I was no match for him in courage, valour, strength and power. But now, on his own, he is giving me his daughter, and I am so grateful to him. I am also so grateful to you. It is because of God's inscrutable ways that I am getting my heart's desire fulfilled."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">King Fatul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="King Fatul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a pious king named Fatul, who ruled his kingdom with utmost concern and compassion. His very name was a source of inspiration to his subjects. He had almost no enemies; everybody was his friend.</p>
<p>But alas, there was one individual who was dead against him, and that was his own younger brother, Kabu. Kabu was terribly jealous of his elder brother, because he had the throne. "Everybody admires him and nobody cares for me," Kabu said. "If I could become King, I would rule the kingdom more wisely, more affectionately and more divinely than my brother. If only I could be given a chance!"</p>
<p>King Fatul's subjects, however, felt that Kabu was useless. They said to him, "Your brother keeps you in the palace; that is more than enough for you. We will never accept you as our king. There is no comparison between you two."</p>
<p>At this Kabu was very sad and mad, but what could he do? He was helpless. He could never become King, even by dethroning his brother, for the subjects would not tolerate it. The best thing, he thought, would be for him to kill his brother.</p>
<p>King Fatul came to hear about his brother's feelings. He felt sorry for Kabu and one day said to him, "Kabu, don't kill me. It will be a disgrace to the royal family. My brother, I have tried my best to be of service to my subjects. But now I have had enough of name and fame. Since you have the desire to rule the kingdom, rule it. My only request is that you rule it wisely. I am giving up the throne and going into the forest to pray and meditate the rest of my life. The rest of my life I will give all to God."</p>
<p>The younger brother was so moved and he touched his brother's feet. "I will do my best. I really wanted to become King, and I shall not exploit my subjects. They are most precious to me. I am so grateful to you for your tremendous sacrifice."</p>
<p>When the older brother left the palace, all the people mourned and cried. They suffered beyond any human imagination. Thousands of his subjects followed him to the edge of the forest and then they returned with heavy hearts.</p>
<p>Once Kabu started ruling the kingdom, he began to fear what might happen when Fatul's son, Gokul, became mature. Kabu said, "Now he is a little boy, but in a few years' time, when he grows up, he may decide to fight for the throne, and everybody may take his side." Therefore, Kabu ordered Gokul and Gokul's mother into exile.</p>
<p>No matter how hard Kabu tried to be a good King, nobody appreciated him. Whenever he did something good, people felt it was all deception and ascribed some motive to it. They felt that he was not doing it sincerely, or that there was something behind it. Nobody listened to him and everybody hated him. This made Kabu very sad and angry.</p>
<p>King Kabu tried for a few years more, but still he failed to please his subjects. Finally he said, "I have had enough. If people don't like me, why do I have to rule the kingdom? I don't need these subjects. I can live all by myself and be happy."</p>
<p>He thought of his brother and said, "My brother was happy when he was the King, but now he has become infinitely happier. He prays and meditates in the forest and lives on fruits and nuts. He is so happy in the forest. I wanted happiness; that was my only desire. I thought that by becoming King I would become happy, but now I see I will never be happy as King."</p>
<p>So Kabu went to the forest and begged his brother to come back and rule the kingdom. But Fatul refused. "No, the joy that I am getting is real joy. Previously the joy was not complete. I was all the time afraid that another King would come and attack my kingdom, or that a minister of mine would create problems for me, or that my subjects wouldn't listen to me. All kinds of fears, worries and anxieties used to torment me, and my happiness was negligible. But now I have found peace and joy, and this joy nobody can steal. So I am not going back to the kingdom."</p>
<p>Kabu pleaded and pleaded with Fatul, "Please, I have tried in every possible way to be a good King, but my subjects don't believe that I am sincere."</p>
<p>Fatul said, "That is because your journey's start was not divine. Everybody loved me and adored me. You were the only one who was jealous of me. God brought me into the world a few years before you. That is why I became King. Our father was always most kind and affectionate to both of us. Do you not think that he felt sad in the other world that you were so jealous of me that I had to give you the throne?"</p>
<p>Some of the ministers who had come with King Kabu said, "King Kabu, let us go back to the palace. Somebody must be King."</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "I am not going back to the palace. I will also pray and meditate."</p>
<p>There was a chorus of laughter from the ministers, and Kabu got mad: "You are my subjects and still you mock at me? Do you think that I don't have the capacity to pray and meditate like my brother?"</p>
<p>They said, "Certainly you have, but this capacity is not yet manifested. In a few incarnations you will start to pray and meditate."</p>
<p>Kabu was very disturbed: "I am not going to leave this forest. Here I will pray and meditate with my brother."</p>
<p>Fatul said, "I have no objection, but you need more purity."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Kabu.</p>
<p>Fatul explained, "Purity means the sincere and soulful expansion of the heart. If your heart does not expand, you will not be able to enjoy the joy I am having. My heart expanded; I became one with all my subjects. Again my heart expanded and I gave you the kingdom. Therefore I was happy, I am happy and I shall always remain happy. It is because of my purity-heart that I am all the time getting joy."</p>
<p>Kabu said, "I don't know anything about purity and I don't want to know. But I know that if you remain my guide, my pole star, I will be happy. If you are my pilot, I am destined to be happy and peace will definitely follow me. Therefore, I am staying here; and I am not going back to the kingdom. It was your kingdom and I am giving it back to you."</p>
<p>But Fatul refused, "I won't take it."</p>
<p>Kabu insisted, "I shall soulfully remain with you."</p>
<p>At this point one of the ministers said, "If both brothers stay here, who will rule the kingdom? You two are not doing justice to your kingdom. One of you must come back; it is your duty. If Fatul does not want to return because he has already become a sannyasi, then Kabu should return. It is too soon for him to give up name and fame, since he so desired them."</p>
<p>Kabu said, "Anything that I find to be good, I always do immediately. So I will stay with my brother and, in serving him, I shall get the greatest joy."</p>
<p>Another minister who was very old said, "You will be happy, your older brother will be happy and my mind will be happy if we do one thing. You have a daughter and your brother has a son. Look at your meanness! When you became King, you put your older brother's son and wife in exile, even though your brother relinquished his throne for you. You should have kept his son and wife in your palace and given them your due affection and love. Where is your sense of duty?"</p>
<p>Kabu said, "Please, please, do not bring the past to the fore. I am miserable for all my misdeeds. Only tell me what you want me to do. I will do everything to please my nephew — I am setting him free immediately. O forgive me, I have done everything wrong and undivine because of fear. I thought that when he became mature everybody would take his side and dethrone me. That's why I put him into exile. Now I myself do not want the kingdom. I want a higher Kingdom, a divinely pure Kingdom, a divinely illumining Kingdom."</p>
<p>The older minister said, "Then your daughter and your brother's son should get married and rule as King and Queen. Both of them are extremely good in every way. If they become King and Queen, then your kingdom will once more shine bright, brighter, brightest. Your brother is happy because he has become a sannyasi and renounced the world. He is getting God as his only friend. You will be happy from now on, for you are getting your brother as your pole star to guide you. You will be happy because you are entering into the spiritual life which is the real life. So naturally you will get real happiness from it.</p>
<p>"And we will be happy only when we have a good King and Queen. Your daughter and your brother's son will be a good match, and we shall devotedly listen to them. We shall be happy, extremely happy, when they rule us and guide us."</p>
<p>Kabu said, "Definitely we shall do that. But you go and arrange it, O Minister. I won't go back. I will remain here for the rest of my life together with my brother. You can release my nephew and tell him that I implore his forgiveness. Also tell my sister-in-law that I implore her forgiveness ten times. Now let my daughter and nephew get married and let them peacefully rule the kingdom. Let everyone enjoy peace in his own way, for peace is satisfaction and satisfaction is all."</p>
