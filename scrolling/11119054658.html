<p>When we started the race, I was absolutely the last person. A young girl went ahead of me and told me that she was not going to be last. What an insult! But after two or three hundred metres, she surrendered.</p>
<p>Then, after 600 metres, whom did I see? Vince! He was my first rival. I was watching him and watching him, following him very faithfully. After 1200 metres I saluted him and passed him.</p>
<p>Then I saw Sarama just before we came to a hill. The hill was my worst enemy. I said, "Perhaps those two will go ahead of me." But fortunately they did not go ahead of me.</p>

<p>During the race at least 12 people recognised me. They called out, "Sri, Sri!" They said I could make it.</p>
<p>There was a girl from our Montreal Centre who kept going ahead of me. Sometimes I would come very close to her. Then she would get tremendous inspiration and run ahead and disappear.</p>
<p>When I had completed five miles, a very nice black man who was watching came up to me to give me special advice. He told me, "Inhale, exhale three times. If you do that, then you will be able to beat that sissy!" He was encouraging me, telling me to defeat her.</p>

<p>In the race, a 16-year-old boy named Stanley could easily have gone ahead of me. But when I started walking, he also started walking. Then he started appreciating our races like anything. He said our races were much better. He said, "Here there are no split times, no mile markers. There is absolutely nothing!" He also said he liked our T-shirts, especially our half-marathon T-shirt.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the race people were telling us, "After the turn it is only a quarter of a mile." But that quarter of a mile never ended.</p>
<p>After I finished the race, I took a few steps and somebody said to me, "Are you the last guy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Oh no, no! There are people behind me."</p>

<p>Today I ran the three-mile fun run for Queens Day in Flushing Meadow Park.</p>
<p>After running one mile at a seven-minute pace, I drank water. I was walking very nicely for 100 metres. After two miles again I started.</p>
<p>At two and a half miles I said, "Go, go!" to Lavanya. At first she didn't see me, because I was so far ahead. Then she went ahead of me.</p>
<p>My timing was better than my best three miles, but when our boys measured the course, it was 100 metres short.</p>
<p>In the morning I had played 30 or 40 games of tennis. Then I took so much exercise. And I hadn't eaten for the previous two days. These are all my excuses why Lavanya finished 100 metres ahead of me.</p>

<p>He said, "I will see you next week at the hundred-miler."</p>
<p>I said, "Definitely I will be there."</p>

<p>In today's half-marathon, Chandika defeated Lavanya, Chetana and Nilima on my behalf. Deliberately I was staying seven metres behind Chandika, saying to myself, "I will defeat all of them." After two miles I surrendered, but Chandika went ahead and defeated them.</p>
<p>At one point, Sarama was going ahead of me with such devotion and surrender. Great, Sarama!</p>
<p>When I saw Tarak, he gave me such a wonderful smile. Then I found out that it was because he had gone ahead of Pahar. To get a smile from Tarak is no joke! Mahiyan and Tarak were running together. Then, at the last moment, Tarak had to defeat Mahiyan.</p>
<p>As you know, I didn't have the courage or strength or stamina to finish. From the first mile I wanted to surrender.</p>
<p>At the finish line I was sitting in the car. Sundar came up and told me of his deplorable performance with such sincerity and soulfulness. There was no false modesty — only sincerity and soulfulness. I was so proud of him. How I wish all the disciples, when they don't do well, would maintain this kind of cheerful and soulful consciousness!</p>

<p>While I was running on my course near Jones Beach, I saw a fat woman and a fat man riding bicycles. When they came to the bridge, the wife started walking but the man kept riding, even though there was a sign saying to get off your bike and walk it over the bridge.</p>

<p>This morning I phoned up Baoul and told him to meet me along the course going towards Flushing Meadow Park. Usually he comes when I am at the 500 or 600-metre mark. But this time, O God, even after I completed one mile, there was still no sign of him. I said to myself, "That means he is asleep!"</p>
<p>Then I said, "Since he is not here, let me watch the time myself. Let me run a second mile. Then perhaps he will come."</p>
<p>In my second mile, when I came to 1100 metres, I got inspiration to walk a little. So I walked for ten or fifteen metres. When I finished, I couldn't believe my time 6:51. Baoul saw me after 1100 metres and told me afterwards, "You were going so fast!"</p>
<p>Then I ran another 300 metres, only blessing Trishul. He is responsible for that course. There were so many branches there and Trishul had donenothing about them. Then, after two or three miles, there were the old marks.</p>

<p>Today I went to Yonkers to run my hill course. X and Y were with me. After some time, Y entered into his trance. X was not feeling well. It was so hot. What an experience! Instead of running, I walked four miles.</p>
<p>Always you have to take advantage of the situation. If I want to run on 150th Street, I can do it again and again and again. But during the trip to Yonkers, I will write poems and do many things, whereas I may not get inspiration at that hour to write poems in my house. So I force myself to go to Yonkers to run the four-mile hill course there.</p>
<p>It usually takes 45 minutes to drive there. Today it took one hour and fifteen minutes. While in the car, I could have slept, played my flute or read the newspaper. But I took the opportunity to dictate poems. Everything can be a blessing! You can have a comfortable life and stay home and accomplish nothing. But each time I go to Yonkers I can dictate 40 or 50 poems.</p>

<p>I was watching the 100-mile race at Shea Stadium when Cahit saw me. He walked to the sprinkler and washed his hands. Then he came over and shook hands with me and said, "Sri Chinmoy, it is so nice to see you here." He was one of the runners, but he came to a complete stop and washed his hands so he could shake hands with me.</p>
<p>James and Arpan were running together. Both of them were in a very good consciousness, and they smiled at me very soulfully. Then Trishul passed by me, not even one foot away, almost dashing into me, but he did not even see me.Databir was forty metres away from me. He saw Databir and said, "Hi." Then he saw me and stopped, smiled and folded his hands</p>
<p>When Nathan saw me, he said, "Sri, I have something to tell you. I am studying your books."</p>

<p>At the 100-mile race Arpan was so excited because he got number 27, which is the day of my birthday.</p>
<p>Nathan doesn't like to talk to people when he is very exhausted. At 74 miles he said, "These people, what are they telling me? They should come and start a marathon in my state." He had 26 miles left. But when he came near me, he smiled at me and his mood changed.</p>
<p>The great Stu Mittleman was hit by a bicycle at midnight. He was jolted. Of all people, he was the one who had to be attacked!</p>
<p>Seven women joined the race. Four finished. Many men also gave up. The runners had to have completed a 50-mile race before this.</p>
<p>They gave us a very big prize, a plate, because Arpan, James and Trishul won the 50-mile National Team Championship.</p>
<p>At six in the morning George Vallasi ran over to greet me.</p>
<p>I was shivering. It was so cold, and Baoul didn't have any jacket in his car. It was foggy and drizzling.</p>
<p>George told us that many excellent runners say that they used to dream night after night about baseball. But we have created so much interest in running that people are losing interest in baseball. Running is giving them so much joy that they are no longer interested in baseball.</p>

<p>Nathan Whiting said he has read thousands of poetry books, but he has never read anybody who writes in the English language in such a natural way as I do.</p>
<p>I had told in that I liked his poetry book, so he told me that.</p>
<p>I said, "Nathan!"</p>
<p>He said, "Yes, I mean it!"</p>
