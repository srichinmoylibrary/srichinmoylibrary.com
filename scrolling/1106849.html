<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. If we do something really good and really divine, then God expedites our spiritual journey. He increases our speed and shortens the time it will take us to reach our goal. If our speed is accelerated, then naturally we shall reach our destination sooner than otherwise. So we should try to do divine things in order to reach our destination sooner than at once.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are God's eternal child when you can sincerely feel at every moment that God is also an eternal Child. First you have to want to be His Eternity's child-partner. Then you have to feel that God Himself is an eternal Child who is playing with you all the time in His Eternity's Heart-Garden. You have to feel that He is not only playing with you but also that He is always eager to play with you, smile with you, dance with you and cry with you and for you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can offer more gratitude to God only by feeling that He is giving us at every moment more and more and more. If somebody gives me a flower, I will offer him my gratitude. If he gives me two flowers, I will give him more gratitude. Then if he gives me three flowers, I will offer him even more gratitude. In God's case, He wants to give us infinitely more than we need, so naturally our gratitude will increase. But we have to know that He gives everything at His own time and in His own Way — not at our hour or according to our wishes. Our fixed hour is this very moment. But if He gives us something at this moment, then it may create a very serious problem for us. It may increase our ego, pride or vanity or produce many other undivine results. So we can show more gratitude to God by feeling that He is giving us at every moment infinitely more than we need and by offering more of our conscious and sleepless surrender to His Will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now you are not in the angel-world; you are now leading a human life, and human life will one day turn into divine life. If you can remain in the angel-consciousness — which is very, very pure and beautiful — while in the human body, God will definitely love you more than if you remain in the human consciousness. But you have to know that God will love you the most if you lead a pure and spiritual life as a human being. For it is only from the human life that we can reach the divine life. An angel is like a beautiful child. A child has no mind, no jealousy, no insecurity. Compared to someone who is, let us say, twenty years old and who is filled with jealousy, insecurity and so many other undivine qualities, an angel's consciousness is definitely better. So definitely God loves the angel-consciousness more. Again, if someone is a little more mature — thirty years old, let us say — and is leading a very pure, very spiritual, very divine life, this person will be able to manifest God much more than a little child. So if a human being is quite pure and, at the same time, is aspiring very hard and manifesting God most powerfully, then naturally God will love that person more than the angel who is only very sweet and very innocent.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Thousands of years ago there lived the Vedic Seers. They prayed to God and meditated on God most soulfully and most devotedly. At that time God presented Himself to the Seers in a most beautiful, absolutely subtle, divinised human form. Although they were human beings, these Seers were able to see the subtle body of God. So 7,000 or 10,000 years ago, through the practice of spirituality the human consciousness was raised to the Himalayan height and people could see and feel God's Presence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When does God smile?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When does God smile?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God smiles when a seeker tries to do God's Will even if he fails again and again. God smiles because the seeker is aiming at the right thing and one day will reach the right destination. God smiles when the seeker does the right thing and then cheerfully surrenders the result to God's Will, even if the immediate result is not satisfying.</p>
<p>God smiles when the seeker every day decreases his desires in the material world and increases his aspiration in the spiritual world. If there are five things that I want from the material world today, then tomorrow I will desire only four things. And in the spiritual world, if I have one good quality today, then tomorrow I will try to have two good qualities.</p>
<p>Suppose that previously I wanted to have three cars to show off to my friends. Now that I have become more spiritual, I will give up the idea of three cars and feel the desire for only two cars. Then after some time I will feel that only one car is necessary.</p>
<p>Similarly, in my spiritual life, let us say that today I want only simplicity. If I become more spiritual, tomorrow I will want not only simplicity but also sincerity. Then the day after tomorrow I will realise that I also need purity, and I will pray to God for purity as well. In this way I will increase my good qualities.</p>
<p>If we can decrease our desires in the material life and increase our aspiration in the spiritual life, then God is bound to smile. And each time He smiles, He makes us feel that He really wants us to realise Him, reveal Him and manifest Him in His own Way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">If you are forced to fight an enemy and you kill somebody, do you get any bad karma?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="If you are forced to fight an enemy and you kill somebody, do you get any bad karma?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It all depends on what kind of war it is. If it is a war between good forces and bad forces, between divine forces and undivine forces, like in the <em>Mahabharata</em>, that is one thing. In that war, the divine people took the side of Lord Krishna, and the undivine people were those who stood against him. Those who fought for Lord Krishna were carrying out the Will of the Supreme. So if they killed someone, they did not suffer any bad consequences. And if they were killed while fighting for this divine cause, immediately they were taken to a higher world.</p>
<p>But today there is so much fighting that is against God's Will. These wars are caused by differences of opinion or because one country wants to increase its territory. Countries are fighting because they want to show their supremacy or because they feel that their policies are good whereas someone else's policies are bad. They want only to aggrandise their ego or show that they are stronger. If you fight in this kind of war and kill people, even if your government forces you to, you will have to suffer the consequences. And if you are killed fighting in this kind of war, you will not necessarily go to Heaven.</p>
<p>If your country is attacked and you are forced to fight, definitely you have to defend your country. If you are fighting against the ignorance of some undivine people, if you are fighting some human beings who have become hostile forces and you know it is God's Will that you fight, then you are doing the right thing and there will be no bad consequences. But people do not know what God's Will is, and so many modern-day wars are not divine. Just because you are forced by the government to fight an undivine war, there is no certainty, no guarantee, no assurance that you will go to a higher world if you are killed, or that you will not suffer from the laws of karma for killing others. Just because you or your government do not know what God's Will is does not mean that you will escape punishment for your deeds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I be aware of God at every moment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I be aware of God at every moment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can be aware of God at every moment if you can feel that God is the only one who loves you and who can give you everything you want. You have to feel that God loves you at every moment, and will always love you. Also you have to feel that God is your best and only friend. You may feel that your first friend is your mother or father. But after fifty, sixty or seventy years your parents and you will have left the body. And in your next incarnation you may very well have a different set of parents. But God is your own friend who will be with you and for you throughout Eternity.</p>
<p>If you can feel that God is your best and only friend, and that He will be with you throughout Eternity, then you will be able to be conscious of Him at every moment. In the ordinary life you think of your friends quite often. If somebody is your best friend, you think of him so many times during the day! So God is not only your best friend, but also your only friend who will never leave you or fail you. Others will eventually fail you in spite of their best intentions, but God is the only one who will always help you. So if you can feel this, then easily you can be aware of God at every moment of your life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People realise God only by doing one thing — loving God. And how do people love God? By praying to God and by meditating on God. I always say that love has to go from the few to the many. You started by loving your parents. Then you came to feel that your brother also is so affectionate to you, and you loved him. So, like this, you go from loving your parents to loving your dear ones, and then to loving your neighbours, your country, the world and, finally, the universe. God is both the Creator and the creation. When you can love the entire creation, God will tell you, "Look, you are loving my whole creation and my creation and I are one. I am very pleased with you. You can realise Me as your own."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! If you do something wrong, then you should do something good to nullify it. But you have to know that God has His own time. If today you do something bad and then tomorrow you do something good, God may not immediately change your fate. He may wait a few more days to see whether you are going to continue doing the right thing. Otherwise, perhaps the day after tomorrow you will start doing bad things again. So God will watch you to see if you are more interested in doing bad things or good things. If He sees clearly that from now on you are going to do only good things, then definitely He will nullify the bad things that you did and give you a very peaceful, joyful and illumining life. So no matter how many bad things you have done in the past, always try to start doing good things. Then eventually you will conquer the bad things in your life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Many yogis realise God on mountains or at the foot of mountains. Are mountains very close to God in any way?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Many yogis realise God on mountains or at the foot of mountains. Are mountains very close to God in any way?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Mountains are close to God; oceans are close to God. Everything and everybody is close to God. But if somebody realises God, then naturally He will be infinitely closer to God than those who have not.</p>
<p>It is true that mountains offer inspiration to some seekers. People get tremendous inspiration at the foot of a mountain because of its enormous height. The atmosphere is very pure, very divine, very inspiring. If something gives us inspiration and we love that thing, then we feel that God also loves that particular thing most powerfully. So, in that sense, you can say that a mountain is closer to God than some other place.</p>
<p>The ocean and the sky also inspire many seekers. Again, some Indian yogis, like Ramana Maharshi, got inspiration meditating inside a cave. So those who are his admirers and devotees will feel that God is closer to a cave than to a mountain. And some people who have realised God inside their own room will feel that their room is closer to God than a mountain. So it depends on who realised God at a particular place and on whether or not you are that individual's devotee or admirer. In general, however, people will get more inspiration from a mountain than from a small room.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Now that you have entered into the spiritual life, you can easily love God and satisfy God in His own Way. You have to always feel that God knows what you actually need. In most cases this is very different from what you want. You want many, many things that will delay your spiritual progress. That is why God may not give these things to you. What you want cannot help you; it can only create problems for you. But what you need will definitely help you, and it will never create any problems for you. If you have love, devotion, surrender and gratitude, then God is bound to give you everything that you need. So you can please God in His own Way by praying to God to give you only what you need from Him — His Compassion, His Love, His Forgiveness. If you can pray for these things with love, devotion and surrender, then you will be able to please God at every moment in His own Way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind does not want us to get anything from anybody other than itself. Right from the beginning the human mind wants to keep us away from everything and everybody. If God is in the picture, then the mind will not have supremacy. Therefore, the mind wants to keep the Supreme away from us, and it wants to keep us from getting what the Supreme wants to give us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First we have to free ourselves of impure thoughts and feelings. Once we have pure thoughts in our mind and pure feelings inside our heart, then we can easily enter into God's Heart-Garden at any moment, and we can remain there permanently.</p>
