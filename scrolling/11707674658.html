  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Since so many people are crying for light, what spiritual qualities do the disciples lack that prevent us from manifesting the Supreme&#039;s Light and attracting more people to the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since so many people are crying for light, what spiritual qualities do the disciples lack that prevent us from manifesting the Supreme&#039;s Light and attracting more people to the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a question of the readiness and eagerness of the disciples who are working to spread or manifest the Supreme's Light. Some of those who come to work on manifestation are ready and eager. Others are ready but not eager to work, and some are not even inwardly ready. It is like a class. Some students are no good at all; others are very good and a few are super-excellent. Yet they are all studying together in the same class and the teacher is giving them the same lesson. But until all of them become excellent, the teacher cannot be confident that his teaching has been successful.</p>
<p>Some people come just to have fun; they enjoy putting up posters and doing similar kinds of jobs. But when I look at them, I see that from the spiritual point of view they are only wasting their precious time. They are serving the Supreme in their Guru, and for that I am grateful to them. But if I am sincere, I have to say that their consciousness is not being elevated. They are not gaining anything spiritually because they have no intense sincerity and no devotion in their heart. Each time you put up a poster, you have to see twenty or fifty faces there. For each poster you put up, you have to feel that there are fifty hearts crying for light who are going to see this poster. But many of you are just working mechanically. In India, if someone works for four hours he gets a few rupees. In my case, I do not give you people money; I give you my love, my affection, my blessings. But in his heart of hearts, this Indian Master is not pleased with you because you did not have intense sincerity in your heart; you did not work with a pure heart, soulfully, devotedly and lovingly.</p>
<p>There are many other things that I also notice. I see how much purity you are carrying inside your mind, inside your vital and inside your heart. If there is no purity in your mind, for example, if your mind is thinking that someone else has a better job than you or is getting closer to the Master than you, then you are finished! Also, your inspiration has to be more pure. Many times when you are inspired to do something your inspiration is heavy — filled with carelessness, callousness and indifference. At least inspiration is there, but inside inspiration there also has to be one-pointed eagerness. Again, I see how much insecurity you are carrying. While you are working, many of you are thinking, "Perhaps Guru is appreciating so-and-so more than me." So whom do you think you are fooling? You are not fooling me; only you are breaking my heart.</p>
<p>The Message has come from Above that 7,000 or 10,000 or 13,000 souls inwardly are crying for the kind of light that we can offer them at a Peace Concert. God's Hour has struck. But the instruments that I have got are not spiritually or inwardly ready and eager. Unfortunately, I am a beggar, and beggars cannot be choosers. The divine in me is hungry and the divine in you is also hungry. But the divine in both of us is being fed such a small portion that our hunger is not being fulfilled. How long will the world remain in this kind of unaspiring consciousness?</p>
<p>It is like the Indian story about the king who asks his subjects to fill the pond with milk. Each one says, "If I put in water instead of milk, no harm! The others will put in milk and the King will not notice." So in the end no one puts in milk. It is never you, but always somebody else who you feel should do the right thing. But that somebody else does not exist! Each worker is like a petal of a flower. Each petal is responsible only for its own beauty; it is not responsible for all the other petals. But if the flower is to have beauty and fragrance, then all the petals have to be beautiful and fragrant. So if each petal seriously tries to have the necessary purity, beauty and fragrance, then the flower will become perfect.</p>
<p>These things are needed to bring down peace in the way that we want to bring down peace. Others can bring thousands of people in their own way, but it is not for peace. A jazz musician or somebody else can get thousands and thousands of people, but their standard is totally different from ours. They can succeed because they are working on one level of consciousness, whereas we want to establish peace and divinity on another level.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life we do not need to have a conception of things. We have not seen God, but we are taught from the very beginning by our soul and by our parents that God exists. We know that God is all kindness and affection, that God embodies all the divine qualities. God and God-realisation are part and parcel of one another. They are like the flower and its fragrance. If God is the fragrance, then God-realisation is the flower, and vice versa. If you say that you have no idea of God-realisation, then I will say, "You have no idea of God either, so how can you think of God and love God; how can you pray and meditate?" But you can and do love God; you can and do pray and meditate, even though right now God remains for you only a vague idea.</p>
<p>Before we learn a subject, we have no idea what the subject is all about. In fact, that is the reason we study it. In the case of God-realisation, we study the subject through our prayer, meditation and other disciplines. It is the most difficult subject, but whoever is praying and meditating sincerely, or even insincerely, is studying the God-realisation subject. To get the fruits of our outer study, let us say a Master's degree, it takes many years. Step by step we proceed from kindergarten to university. In the spiritual life also, we start with prayer and meditation. Then we dive within and advance to contemplation and, finally, one day we complete our journey. Again, when we complete our inner journey, to our wide surprise we see that we are just at the beginning of a new journey! In the spiritual life, everything is a totally new beginning. It is like discovering a most beautiful garden. We feel that there cannot be any garden more beautiful. But God says, "No, there is a garden infinitely more beautiful."</p>
<p>Before God-realisation, we can have only the vaguest conception of who and what God is. It is only after we become God-realised that God becomes an absolutely living reality for us. At that time, the Universal Consciousness becomes ours; consciously we become part and parcel of it. What is happening anywhere in the universe we can know if we want to. Also, there are thousands of things a God-realised person does every day that an ordinary human being cannot do. Before God-realisation, I used to do perhaps five or six things per day. Now there is not a single day in which I do not do thousands of things in the inner world. It is the same for all the spiritual Masters who have realised God. God-realised Masters can do all these things because they do not use their mind. With our mind we can do only one thing at a time. The mind can work very fast; it can accomplish one, two, three things very quickly. But the mind cannot do two things at the same time, whereas the God-realised soul can do many, many things simultaneously.</p>
<p>God-realisation is oneness with God's Will. Before we enter into the spiritual life, God's Will is not our concern; we are doing whatever we want to do. But once we enter into the spiritual life, at every moment we try to know what God's Will is. When we start practising spirituality, God does not come and stand in front of us and tell us what He wants. But always there is somebody inside us who is telling us the right thing and prompting us to do the right thing, and that is God. During our prayers and meditations, our soul or the Supreme tells us inwardly what should be done. If we do it, then we walk towards light; but if we do not listen, then we walk in darkness.</p>
<p>If the seeker is fortunate, God also sends His representative to tell His Will, and this representative happens to be the spiritual Master. The disciple may say, "If God Himself were standing in front of me, perhaps He would give some other Message." Or the disciple may think, "This Master is not pleasing me; he is not fulfilling my desire. Perhaps God Himself is not hearing my prayer or does not even know what my desire is." In so many ways the disciple can fool himself by separating God from his Master and convincing himself that God is somewhere else. But if the disciple is spiritually mature, he will feel that God and the Master know what his desires are and, if they do not fulfil his desires, it is because God does not want them to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>If the disciple's aspiration descends and inwardly or outwardly he starts doing wrong things, the disciple may think, "Oh, the Master does not know what I am doing." The Master <em>does</em> know; only he does not speak. If the Master sees that the disciple is always doing the wrong thing, that he is always walking in darkness, then eventually he becomes the silent witness; in silence he witnesses everything. It is just like our human parents. Our parents tell us to do the right thing. But when time and again we do not listen to them, finally they keep quiet and just observe.</p>
<p>I shall tell an incident from around 6:40 this morning. Five disciples were angry with me, but I do not want to say who they are. While I was looking in the mirror and shaving, such blows I was getting inside my head — one after another! Luckily, my face was not cut! I opened my third eye to see who was striking me. The culprits may say, "I was sleeping at that time." True, they may have been sleeping, but last night their aggressive or dissatisfied vital was so displeased and angry with me that some wrong forces entered into me from them and I got such blows!</p>
<p>These experiences almost all the spiritual Masters have. Absolutely the way Muhammad Ali gets punched — that kind of beating we get! Sometimes I do not want to know where it is coming from, because if I see that it is my dear ones who are striking me like this, then I will feel more miserable. The best thing is to get your blows, suffer for a few minutes and then, if you have the capacity, throw the experience into the Universal Consciousness. This morning I did not suffer for more than two minutes. I was strong enough to manage it, so I did not have to bother throwing the attack into the Universal Consciousness. Afterwards, I went downstairs and did my exercises.</p>
<p>This is no cock-and-bull story. Believe me! One day you will have the same fate. All of a sudden you will ask yourself why you are getting such blows. What have you done? One does not even have to be a spiritual Master. Sometimes an ordinary individual may stumble for no rhyme or reason. While you are seated, all of a sudden you may get a muscle pull. It is not because something is wrong in your system, but because something has happened in the inner world. Consciously and deliberately someone was aiming such powerful undivine thoughts at you when you were not aware of it. Because your entire being was not energised or dynamic, your body could not resist and you got the attack. Many, many times you suffer from what you think is some physical ailment that all of a sudden appears out of the blue. But it is not a physical ailment; somebody has attacked you! This game goes on and on.</p>
<p>To come back to your question about the Master's God-smiling eyes, I have shown those God-smiling eyes many, many times, and they are not fake. There shall come a time when each and every disciple of mine will see the truth of what I am saying, whether you now take me seriously or not. The higher you go, the clearer it will be who I am, and the more faith, love and devotion you will have. Again, the lower you go, the more confusion you will find. But when your God-realisation day dawns, somebody will come and give that realisation. At that time, you will not see a totally strange face or body; no, this very face and body of mine will come! But this applies only to the close disciples; I cannot do it for all.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we die, will we see you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we die, will we see you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When my close disciples leave the body, they will be able to see me in this body — with this form, with this face. Or I may send one of my representatives — one of my inner beings who will assume my face, my eyes, everything of mine. At that time you may be uttering the word 'Supreme', but this body, this face, this form will appear before you because the Supreme is sending me. My Highest is the Supreme and your Highest is the Supreme. But at the eleventh hour, if you are sincerely praying to the Supreme either to cure you or to take you back to Him, this face and this body you will see. Whether you see me wearing my track suit, my Indian garments or my shorts, you are bound to see me.</p>
<p>Some of my close disciples already have died. During a dream if they come to you, you can ask them, "Did Guru come? Did Guru come to take you?" I assure you, Guru <em>did</em> come, even if Guru on the physical plane was perhaps playing tennis at that time. I have so many inner beings, and I assure you that one of my beings took my form exactly and carried the person from this world to the other world. Again, I have to say that this experience is not for all, not for all.</p>
<p>But in every case, when somebody dies the Supreme always sends some emissary; you may call it an angel. Sometimes many beings come. Sometimes the being, out of compassion, will take the form of the departing soul's dearest one on earth — whether it was his father, mother, brother, sister, husband or wife. The dearest one may not even be in Heaven; he or she may already have taken a new incarnation in Australia or Africa. But if the departing person is very sincerely crying while going to the other world, and if he is afraid of death, the being whom the Supreme sends can take the exact face and form of his mother or father, or somebody who was very close to him. If the person who is leaving this world sees that his mother has come to take him somewhere, how can he be afraid? He will feel that he is going to a very safe place and he will not be alarmed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If it is difficult for somebody to strive for the Supreme, for the Highest, is it better to insincerely strive for the Highest or to sincerely strive for an intermediate goal?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If it is difficult for somebody to strive for the Supreme, for the Highest, is it better to insincerely strive for the Highest or to sincerely strive for an intermediate goal?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An intermediate goal is for those who have not accepted the spiritual life, for those who are caught by ordinary life. Because they have to think of their children, their husbands and wives, their earthly life, they are already at a lower level. When aspiration is not involved, when someone does not have the inner urge to climb up the mountain, then naturally he will be satisfied to climb up a hill. But once someone begins aspiring and accepts the spiritual life, his goal must be the Highest. There can be no intermediate goal for sincere seekers.</p>
<p>Insincere seekers can have an intermediate goal. But for those who want to be true instruments of God, for those who have the inner courage to dare to say, "I have come into the world to please God in His own Way," there can be no intermediate goal. They have to go to the topmost branch of the aspiration-life-tree. After climbing up a few metres they may slip and fall down; they may fall down again and again. But their goal has to be the Highest.</p>
<p>Once we start compromising with the outer life, our spiritual life is finished. If we think we can be totally involved in the outer life or social life, then we are only fooling ourselves. Before we know it, the outer life will start lording it over us and our inner life will end. As soon as we lose our seriousness in the spiritual life, we are gone. At first we may say to God, "I will please You fifty percent and You please me fifty percent." But eventually we will say, "God, You please me ninety percent because I am so weak." Finally, our message will be: "God, I am so useless! You have to please me ninety-nine percent." Then the game is over. If we can be satisfied with keeping only a one-percent connection with our inner life, with our Source, then our spiritual life is a complete failure.</p>
<p>The day we accepted the spiritual life, we had the hope and eagerness to reach the Highest. Nobody came to our spiritual path with the idea, "If I get a little joy or conquer a little of my jealousy and doubt, that will be enough." No, everyone came with the eagerness, the readiness and the inner urge to become an absolutely divine person. In rare cases, people may have joined the path only to see what it looked like, to see what kind of flowers it had and whether those flowers were really beautiful and fragrant. But in most cases, the disciples joined the path to reach the Highest, which is to please God in God's own Way through love, devotion and surrender. When this is our goal, then inwardly we have to climb up the highest mountain. The problem is that we cleverly and deliberately forget our goal.</p>
<p>True, everybody's height may not be the same, but everybody's willingness can be the same. One disciple may have the capacity to walk with the Master only for one mile, while another has the capacity to run a marathon with the Master. But along with capacity, readiness and eagerness also are of paramount importance. If someone does not have the same capacity as somebody else, that person's willingness God will also take into account. If God sees sincere willingness, immediately He will increase the person's capacity. So many people have run only two miles a day and then completed a marathon. It is all due to their eagerness. Before I completed a marathon, I had covered at most only three or four miles. But my eagerness carried me to my goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we have more discipline?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we have more discipline?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There was a time twenty or twenty-five years ago when, for several months at a stretch, some of my disciples did everything right, everything good, everything positive from morning to evening. Why? Because they were disciplined! They used to get up at six o'clock every morning to pray and meditate and they used to spend their evenings involved in spiritual activities. At that time they cared only for their inner life. They said, "I will not allow myself to mix with undivine people! I will not let myself wallow in the pleasures of ignorance!" Because they led a disciplined life, their love, devotion and surrender to God became most powerful.</p>
<p>But over the years they have become negligent and careless; they have stopped valuing the disciplined life and what it could offer them. As time passed, the outer world has become infinitely more important than their inner life. Gradually their love, devotion and surrender diminished and left them. Now they are convinced that love, devotion and surrender are gone, that they are all in the past. In most cases they have given up; they feel it is not possible to regain these qualities or they feel they are not worth having. Either they say there is nothing in the spiritual life or they say it is too difficult now.</p>
<p>How can you regain your lost inner wealth? By remembering how much joy and satisfaction it gave you! When you led a life of discipline and your love, devotion and surrender were strong, at that time you had infinitely more joy and satisfaction than you have now. At that time, something was roaring within you. You had a childlike feeling. Your whole existence was like a flower. It is not that you were standing in front of a flower, but you yourself had <em>become</em> a most beautiful flower. At every moment you were aiming at something high, higher, highest. Constantly good thoughts were entering into your mind, into your heart, into your life.</p>
<p>If you can once again value most sincerely the joy that you derived from being disciplined, then you will get back that kind of life. If you value the taste of the mango that you ate, then you will do everything to regain that satisfaction. You will go to this shop and that shop enquiring, "Do you have a mango, do you have a mango, do you have a mango?" And if your cry is sincere, God is bound to give you back the thing that you are crying for. When you valued the disciplined life, God gave you the opportunity and the necessity to achieve it. If once more you value it sincerely, then once again God will give you the opportunity to regain your disciplined life, along with the joy, the conviction and the assurance that it offered you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For me, Philadelphia is the capital of America. From the spiritual point of view, America's capital is not Washington, but Philadelphia. That very name is a ringing bell, which is very, very haunting and, at the same time, illumining and fulfilling. As soon as I hear the word 'Philadelphia', no matter who utters it, I hear a bell ringing — like the Indian heart-temple-gong or the American church bell. Philadelphia, for me, always carries Divinity's Reality.</p>

SCA 340-345. Sri Chinmoy had this conversation with A. at Annam Brahma on 11 May 1996, the day after her birthday.</p>
<h2>Please ask me two questions</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Please ask me two questions. The first question I will answer because of all the expressions that you have given me to inspire me in my poetry. Since the beginning of creation, you have given me the most expressions! Nobody can come near you. The other question I will answer because you make most delicious salad. So you get two questions.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If a person has a very strong personality trait, does that have anything to do with the soul? For example, if a person is stubborn or has some unique quality, what relation does this have with the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If a person has a very strong personality trait, does that have anything to do with the soul? For example, if a person is stubborn or has some unique quality, what relation does this have with the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Stubbornness comes mostly from the vital. The vital is very stubborn and the mind is rigid. But any good qualities come only from the soul. From the soul they are received by the heart, vital, mind and body. The heart receives much more than the mind. Sometimes the vital also receives more than the mind. The body receives the least amount of light. The body is like an Indian bullock cart. It always wants rest; its dearest friend is lethargy. If the vital becomes dynamic, then it pushes or pulls the body so the body does something. The body becomes divine only when the vital commands it, like a military commander. If the heart becomes strong, then the heart also can inspire the body.</p>
<p>So any divine quality that you are expressing in and through your life is definitely coming from the soul. Sometimes one particular good quality can be expressed on many planes. The good quality can express itself on the psychic plane, the mental plane, the vital plane or the physical plane. Devotion, for example, can be expressed through the heart, the mind, the vital and the body. When a divine quality that is descending from Above or coming from the soul is expressed on all the planes — physical, vital, mental and psychic — then the seeker becomes really excellent.</p>
<p>Bad qualities also exist. But they come from the mind, vital or physical. Impurity, for example, does not come from the soul or even from the heart. But when too much impurity enters into the heart from the vital and the mind, the poor heart also embodies some impurity. Then the soul comes and tries to save the heart because the soul feels that the heart by nature is good. So the soul puts light into the heart and purifies the heart. Because the mind and vital are quite often very bad, the soul gets disappointed or disgusted with them and lets them take their own time. But the soul does not do that with the heart because it has tremendous love, concern and compassion for the heart — more than for the mind, vital and body.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to know the past? The past is dust. Did you realise God in your previous incarnations? Your goal is God-realisation! If the past did not enable you to realise God, then what good is it? Stupid curiosity is useless. At times we start with curiosity. Then we enter into real spirituality. Then comes one of two things: either frustration, which is destruction; or hope-flowers, which become beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful. Finally we see the reality, and then we get real satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why do you have to think about your soul at this stage of your spiritual development? You have me permanently and eternally, so you do not have to think of your soul. I shall deal with your soul. Just think of the Supreme and pray to the Supreme. Right now you cannot see your soul; God alone knows when you will be able to see your soul. But you can see me. If you believe in me, then I will be able to take you directly to the highest Absolute. If you ever see how your soul meditates on my transcendental photograph, you will say, "Why do we have to do anything as long as we have this picture?" The higher and deeper you go, the more value you will give to my transcendental photograph.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there anything we can do to create harmony? You have given us so many answers. Is there another answer you can give?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there anything we can do to create harmony? You have given us so many answers. Is there another answer you can give?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who wants to live in the basement if one can stay on the topmost floor? On the physical plane, a building can have God knows how many floors, but always there is something called the basement. From the spiritual point of view I use the term 'abysmal abyss'. When we do not have harmony, we remain in the abysmal abyss. It is all darkness: screaming, fighting, wrestling, strangling, boxing, kicking!</p>
<p>Lack of harmony comes when I feel that I know how to do something better than you. Lack of harmony is the song and dance of superiority. Because everybody feels superior, disharmony at every moment is entering into our lives. But what is this feeling of superiority if not a feeling of inferiority expressed in a clever way?</p>
<p>It is only because we are so inferior to God that we are constantly finding fault with God. We say, "I know better than God! God does not understand my situation! God does not see when I do good things; He sees only when I do bad things!" Like this we are always criticising God. If one is really superior, it is beneath his dignity to come down and quarrel with others. God is infinitely superior to us, but does He come down and fight with us? No!</p>
<p>When children argue with their mother, the mother acts as if she knows nothing. The child may have gone only to primary school or high school and the mother perhaps has a high degree from the university. But the child thinks he knows much more than the mother and he is telling the mother all kinds of stupid things. Inwardly the mother is crying and praying to God to give the child illumination, but outwardly she is saying, "Oh, you are right; I am so stupid. I am learning from you."</p>
<p>Similarly, even if we know perfectly well that so-and-so is absolutely wrong, we have to be wise and remain silent. Eventually, the other person will see the light. But if we are all the time fighting and quarrelling, we will only destroy our subtle nerves, which are needed to expedite our spiritual journey. So if we use our wisdom, automatically self-effacement comes. Self-effacement is the easiest and the most effective way to establish harmony. One thing we can do is practise <em>japa</em>, repeating, "Self-effacement, self-effacement, self-effacement." If we do this <em>japa</em>, we walk on pavement that is sunlit, and we reach our destination.</p>
