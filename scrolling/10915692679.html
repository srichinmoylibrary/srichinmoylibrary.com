How does one empty one&#039;s heart of negative forces in order to start meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you should be very sincere with yourself. You have to know whether you are really entering into the heart or into the mind. When your meditation starts early in the morning, either you enter into the heart from the very beginning or you enter into the heart after trying for half an hour or fifteen minutes to meditate in the mind. If you are being disturbed by negative thoughts and negative forces, you can rest assured that you are not in the heart, but in the mind. The spiritual heart is very pure. Wrong forces will not come there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! For beginners especially, it is always advisable to meditate on the heart centre. In fact, even if one is advanced, one should meditate there because from the heart centre you feel oneness with the highest, you get joy and become part and parcel of whatever you are meditating on. If you concentrate on the third eye, you may not have the feeling of oneness. You may see Light, but you will feel that it is not yours. First you will feel that you have seen Light, but then you will think that perhaps it was not Light at all but just imagination or hallucination. Doubt may enter into your mind. When you use the heart, however, the joy that you get you immediately feel is yours; the peace that you feel is yours; anything that you feel becomes yours. This is the heart's capacity for oneness.</p>
<p>So it is always advisable to meditate on the heart first. Once you have established your oneness with infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, you will have the capacity to identify yourself with the Vast. Then, when you concentrate on the third eye and see Light, the Light can easily enter into you and become yours. Once you have established your oneness with the Vast in the form of Peace, Light, Bliss or any other divine quality, when you see Light either inside you or around you, you will have the capacity to identify yourself with it and make it your own. After you have established your identity with Peace, Light and Bliss, when you see these things with your third eye, you will have the capacity to bring them into your system. And if they are already inside you, then you will have the capacity to bring them to the fore. So it is always advisable to meditate on the heart centre. The third eye is good, but it may create confusion, so why take the risk?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why should you concentrate and meditate an the heart instead of an the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why should you concentrate and meditate an the heart instead of an the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before you concentrate on the heart or anything, just think about the mind for a few minutes instead of allowing the mind to think of something else. Separate yourself from the mind and observe the mind. Observe what it has done for you and see whether you are really satisfied with its capacity. The mind has given you many things, but are these things worth having in the spiritual life or not? In the ordinary human life, the mind is of paramount importance. Without it we would not be able to function properly. But if you enter into the spiritual life you will see that most of what the mind has given you is information and not illumination. There is a great difference between the two. You read books and talk to people and get much information from them. But where is illumination? You can read hundreds of pages or talk to hundreds of people, but you will not get illumination. So when you think of what the mind has given you, think at the same time of the thing that you really need most and you will see that the mind has not fulfilled this need. Since your mind has disappointed you, why should you concentrate there?</p>
<p>Once you are totally dissatisfied with the limited capacity of the mind, it will be possible for you to concentrate on the heart. As long as you have tremendous faith in your mind, the mind that complicates and confuses everything, you will be doomed to disappointment in your meditation. Ordinary people think that complication is wisdom. But spiritual people know that complication is dangerous. God is very simple; Light is very simple. It is in our simplicity and sincerity, not in complexity, that the real Truth abides. Complexity cannot give us anything. Complexity itself is destruction.</p>
<p>If you meditate in the mind, you will be able to meditate for perhaps five minutes, and out of that five minutes, for one minute you may meditate very powerfully. After that you will feel your whole head getting tense. First you get joy and satisfaction, but then you may feel a barren desert. For five minutes you will get something, but if you want to go beyond that, you may feel nothing. If you meditate in the heart, a day will come when you start getting satisfaction. If you meditate in the heart, you are meditating where the soul is. True, the light, the consciousness of the soul permeates the whole body, but there is a specific place where the soul resides most of the time, and that is in the heart. If you want illumination, if your ultimate goal is illumination, you will get that illumination from the soul, which is inside the heart. When you know what you want and where to find it, the sensible thing is to go to that place. Otherwise, it will be like going to the hardware store to get groceries. If you concentrate on the mind you will be disappointed and disheartened. You will not get what you want because you have gone to the wrong place. It is like my situation now. I am here at the United Nations. If someone asks, "Where is Chinmoy?" you can say that I am at the United Nations, or you can say that I am in Conference Room 10. My presence is spiritually pervading the entire United Nations, but my living consciousness is right here in this room. If you come here, I will be able to do more for you than for others who are elsewhere in the building. Similarly, when you focus your concentration in the heart, you get much more inner satisfaction than when you meditate in the mind, because the heart is the seat of the soul. You have to know that the Source and the Reality are in the heart. Reality is everywhere, but the actual manifestation of the Reality has to be in a particular place. Inside the heart is the soul, and if you meditate in the heart, the result is infinitely more fulfilling. But it is difficult for some people to meditate in the heart because they are not used to doing it.</p>
<p>You have to be wise. There is a vast difference between what you can get from the mind and what you can get from the heart. The mind is limited; the heart is unlimited. Deep within us is infinite Peace, Light and Bliss. To get a limited quantity is an easy task. Meditation in the mind can give it to you. But you can get more if you meditate in the heart. Suppose you have the opportunity to work at two places. At one place you will earn two hundred dollars, and at the other place five hundred dollars. If you are wise, you will not waste your time at the first place.</p>
<p>Let us not be satisfied with the things that we get very easily. Let us cry for something which is more difficult to get, but which is infinite and everlasting. If you get something from the mind, tomorrow doubt may come and tell you that it is not real. But once you get something from the heart you will never be able to doubt it or forget it. An experience on the psychic plane can never be erased from the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one learn to concentrate on the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one learn to concentrate on the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can concentrate on the tip of your finger, you can also concentrate on your heart. As you concentrate on anything — a picture, a candle, a flame, any material object — so also can you concentrate on the heart. You may close your eyes or look at a wall, but all the time you are thinking of the heart as a dear friend of yours. When this thinking becomes most intense, when it absorbs your entire attention, then you have gone beyond the ordinary way of thinking and entered into concentration. You cannot look physically at your spiritual heart, but you can focus all your attention on it. Then gradually, the power of your concentration enters into the heart and takes you completely out of the realm of the mind.</p>
<p>If you do not have purity in abundant measure, the best thing to do is to invoke purity first, then concentrate on the heart. If the heart is impure, if countless earthly desires are in possession of the heart, then no matter how sincerely you concentrate on the heart you will not be successful in your inner life. Purity plays a most important role in the spiritual life. Purity does not mean having a clean body. Purity is the feeling of having a living shrine deep in the inmost recesses of your heart. When you feel the divine presence of an inner shrine, automatically you are purified. At that time the concentration on the heart will be most effective, and when you can concentrate effectively, you are bound to become conscious of the spiritual heart within you.</p>
<p>When your concentration is good, then try to meditate. Meditation does not have to be in the head. As with concentration, you can also meditate anywhere. You can easily meditate in your heart. Once your meditation has become deep, once you have the capacity to have free access to your spiritual heart, then it will be quite easy for you to reach your spiritual heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does a beginner meditate on the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does a beginner meditate on the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A beginner has to feel that he is a child, no matter how old he is in earthly age. A child's mind is not developed. When he is twelve or thirteen his mind starts functioning on an intellectual level, but before that he is all heart. Whatever he sees, he feels is his own. He identifies spontaneously. This is what the heart does.</p>
<p>When you feel that you are a child, immediately feel that you are standing in a flower garden. This flower garden is your heart. A child can play in a garden for hours. He will go from this flower to that flower, but he will not leave the garden, because he will get joy from the beauty and fragrance of each flower. Inside you is the garden, and you can stay within it for as long as you want. In this way you can meditate on the heart.</p>
<p>The moment you feel that you are a child, you can meditate on the heart. A child will always have someone to take care of him even if his physical parents are not there. God will have somebody to take care of the child, because He feels that the child is helpless right now. When a child cries, immediately someone comes to help him. But when a grown-up person cries, his cry is not even sincere. When a child cries even for a candy, he is very sincere. At that time his candy is the whole world for him. If you give him a hundred-dollar bill, he will not be satisfied; he will only care for his candy. When you feel you are crying like a child for Peace, Light and Truth, and that only those things will satisfy you, then your cry will be fulfilled.</p>

Do you mean that the aspirant is not conscious of that Grace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He is conscious of the Grace, but he cannot conceive it with his mind. Imagination is in the mind. With the mind, if we think that we are carrying something very deep, very vast and very profound, still that thought of vastness and profundity is next to nothing in comparison with the experience that we have had or will have. When somebody tells a child that something is very big, he immediately thinks of an elephant or of a house. That is his conception of largeness. When we think with our mind, our idea of vastness and profundity is similarly limited. The mind cannot conceive of infinite expanse. It cannot properly receive the impression of infinite expanse. So when the aspirant wants to bring down some divine qualities with his mind, he has to know that the mind cannot even properly conceive of these qualities, let alone bring them down. That is because the conceptions of the human mind are limited, whereas the divine qualities are boundless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no conflict within the heart itself, but there is often conflict between the heart and the mind. The real aspiring heart has no will but the will of the soul. It is constantly crying, crying to reach the Highest. The spiritual heart has that kind of aspiration. Until the mind is illumined, the heart will never stop fighting to illumine it. It will cry for light until the mind constantly cries with it. We have to allow the heart to capture the mind and not allow the mind to indulge in doubt or suspicion, which will only delay its own progress.</p>
<p>The vital and the mind are on one side and the heart and soul are on the other side. But the heart and the soul do not like to fight against the vital and the mind all the time, so they allow a compromise and for some time they let the vital and the mind go their own way. But eventually the heart and the soul will not care for any compromise. They also have their strength. Eventually they will fight. They will challenge the vital and mind, saying, "We want your transformation for your own good. No compromise! We have to win." The soul is infinitely more powerful than the mind and the vital and they will have to surrender to the will of the soul.</p>

The heart knows how to identify itself with the Highest, with the farthest, with the inmost. In the case of the mind, this is not so. The mind tries to identify itself with an object, with a person, with something limited. But this identification is not pure or complete. When the mind tries to identify, the mind looks at the object with an eye of hesitation, if not actual suspicion. But when the heart wants to identify itself with something or someone, it uses the feeling of love and oneness. When the heart wants to see something, it sees it unreservedly. But when the mind wants to see something, it tries to delay and separate. The heart simplifies; the mind complicates. The mind unconsciously gets pleasure in things that are complicated and confused, but the heart gets joy in things that are simple.</p>
<p>The human, physical, earthbound mind is at our disposal right now. But the higher mind, the overmind, the intuitive mind, the supermind, are not at our command right now. In our day-to-day life we use the earthbound physical mind, which is constantly contradicting itself. Unfortunately, we seldom use the heart, which is all love, all sympathy, all concern, all purity, all harmony, all oneness.</p>
<p>Why do I tell people to pay more attention to the heart and less to the mind? Because the heart expands. The soul represents our illumination and it is inside the heart that the soul abides. In the spiritual life our treasure is the soul. It is only with the help of the soul that we can make the fastest progress in the inner life and we can contact the soul only by meditating on our heart. All paths lead to the Goal, but there is a particular road that will lead us there faster than the other roads. That road is the heart. It is faster, safer and surer than any other road.</p>
<p>We are the possessors of two rooms. One room is known as the heart-room; the other is known as the mind-room. Right now the mind-room is obscure, unlit, impure and unwilling to open to the light. So we have to remain in the heart-room, the room of light, as much as we can. When we feel that our entire being is surcharged with the inner light that is there, then we can enter into the mind-room and illumine it. But if we enter into the mind-room without sufficient light, we will be totally confused because we are entering into a room which is all darkness. We will be caught there and will become victims of the ignorant, undivine and suspicious forces of the mind. This is why I tell my students first to strengthen their inner being by meditating on the heart. The soul's light is available in the heart. If we concentrate on the heart, sooner or later the light of the soul is bound to come to the fore. At that time, we will know that we are in possession of the inner light, and we will be able to use it at our own sweet will. Then we can enter into the mind-room to illumine it. But very often we make the Himalayan blunder of entering into the mind-room just because we see that it is all confusion and darkness. We have to know whether we have the necessary light at our command to illumine darkness. If we do not have the necessary light at our command, we have to enter only into the heart-room. There we can meditate and receive the inner light of the soul until we are inwardly strong. So we should not enter into the mind-room at the very beginning of our spiritual journey. To enter into that room safely we need inner confidence, inner light and inner assurance from the Supreme.</p>

Can you please tell me in what ways your path tends to focus the aspirant&#039;s attention on the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since you feel that spiritual aspirants should pay more attention to the heart than to the mind, I assume that your path is primarily a path of the heart.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Love, devotion, surrender: this is our path. Love is the first rung, devotion is the second rung, and surrender is the third and final rung of our spiritual ladder. As you know, the heart is the seat of love. Human love is immediately followed by frustration, but divine love is an expansion of our consciousness. Human love means only one thing: possess and be possessed. Divine love means another thing: illumine and be illumined, liberate and be liberated. When we try to possess others, we are immediately possessed. When we try to illumine and liberate others, we ourselves are illumined and liberated.</p>
<p>In human love we observe a significant thing. When we love someone, we try to spend our precious time with that particular person, or thinking about him. We devote ourselves to the person. In the spiritual life, too, if we really love God, or some spiritual Master, then naturally we will have the inner urge to offer our pure love to him and to devote ourselves to him through our aspiration and self-dedication. Otherwise, what we have is not real love. Even human love freely offers its service to please the loved one. In the spiritual life this self-offering has to be far more intense. We should be ready to give all that we have and all that we are to God, to our spiritual Master, to the path that we are following. This total self-offering is devotion.</p>
<p>But complete liberation comes only with surrender to the Will of the Infinite. By surrendering our finite existence to the Infinite, we become consciously one with the Infinite. We are not entering into a stranger or a foreigner; the Infinite is our own unrealised power. The finite has always been the unfulfilled, unmanifested part of the Infinite. As ordinary human beings we are finite, but as conscious divine instruments we can never be finite, for inside us the glowing Divinity of the Supreme has come to the fore.</p>
<p>We have to have the feeling of true love for the Supreme in us. Then we have to know that only in sincere self-dedication does our love find its expression. But in order to achieve true fulfillment constantly and eternally, we have to see and feel our true oneness with the Absolute. The heart has the secret key to open the door of identification and allow us to see our oneness with God. Once we feel our oneness with the Absolute, we have to make this oneness total, permanent and eternal. For this we need the divine message of surrender. Our implicit, unreserved, inseparable, eternal, unconditional surrender to the Supreme is absolutely necessary for God-realisation. Love is the first necessity. Devotion is the second necessity. Surrender is the third and ultimate necessity. These three steps will take us swiftly, safely and surely to our transcendental Goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two roads you can take: one is the mental road and one is the psychic road. The easiest, fastest and most convincing road is the psychic road, the road of the heart. When we feel something, we are more convinced than when we see something. When we see something with our eyes, when we actually approach the thing or when we take a second look, it may look different. But when we really feel something inside the heart, immediately there is certainty. That is because we do not have the capacity of identification with the mind. But with the heart we immediately identify. When the mother hears the cry of the child, immediately she runs to him, because she has become one with the child. In the spiritual life when the child, the aspirant, cries, immediately God comes running.</p>
<p>We call the path of the heart the sunlit path. On this path progress is faster than the fastest, because inside the heart is the soul. The soul is all light. It is the divine messenger, the divine representative of God. If you really knock at the heart's door, everything is achieved, because when the heart's door is opened you will find the soul within. So please concentrate, meditate and contemplate on the heart. Everything that you want from God, in God and for God must come directly from there.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we integrate the mind and the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we integrate the mind and the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. One way is for the heart to enter into the mind. The other way is for the mind to enter into the heart. Let us take the heart as the mother and the mind as the child. Either the child has to go to the mother, who is calm, quiet and full of love, or the mother has to go to the child, who right now is uncertain, doubtful and restless.</p>
<p>When the mother comes to the child, at that time the child — which is the mind — has to feel that the mother — the heart — has come with good intentions: to calm the mind, to free it, to fulfil it in a divine way. If the doubting and restless mind feels that the heart has come to bother it, and that its restlessness is something very good which it wants to keep, then it is lost. If the child is restless, doubtful, suspicious, and if he cherishes all these undivine qualities and feels they are his best qualities, then what can the poor mother do? The heart will have the good intention of transforming the mind's doubt into faith, and his other undivine qualities into divine qualities. But the mind has to be prepared; it has to feel that the heart has come with the idea of changing him for the better.</p>
<p>The other way, after the child has gone through everything negative and destructive — fear, doubt, suspicion, jealousy, impurity — he comes to a point where he feels that it is high time for him to go to someone who can give him something better. Who is this someone? The mother, the heart. The mother is more than eager to illumine her own child. If the mind is aspiring, it will immediately feel that the heart is the mother, the real mother. And the heart will always feel that the mind is a child who needs instruction.</p>
<p>Both ways are effective. If the mind is ready to learn from the heart, the heart is always eager to teach it. The mother is ready to help the child, to serve the child twenty-four hours a day. It is the child who sometimes becomes irritated, disobedient or obstinate, who feels that he knows everything and has nothing to learn from anybody else. But the mind must learn from someone else. Even the mother, the heart, gets knowledge from someone else — from the soul, which is all light. Let us call the soul the grandmother. From the grandmother the mother learns, and from the mother the child learns. The soul teaches the heart and the heart teaches the mind. If we can see the relationship between the heart and the mind as the relationship of a mother to her child, that is the best way to integrate the two.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you tell if something comes from the mind or the heart, or do things always go from the heart to the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you tell if something comes from the mind or the heart, or do things always go from the heart to the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One cannot always tell absolutely if something is coming from the mind or the heart. We should always listen to the heart, for the heart is childlike and pure. But the mind thinks that the heart is childish and does not want to listen to the heart. It cares only for its own knowledge and not for the heart's wisdom. Needless to say, we should always see the world through the heart.</p>
<p>Something from the heart does not have to go to the mind. That is, the heart need not communicate through the mind or through anything else. The heart is very eloquent in its own right. The moment I enter into a room and see someone, I immediately know all about him. The other person does not have to say a word to me outwardly; his heart tells me everything in a fleeting second. My heart is speaking to him and his heart is speaking to me. In this case, the heart is not using the mind at all to communicate. It is speaking its own language.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I answer questions because sometimes I see that your heart is not able to convince your mind of the truth which the heart already knows. But if you hear this truth from me, your mind will try to see something in my Wisdom- Light. Your heart, as you say, has no questions. It intuitively knows all the answers. But your mind has quite a few questions. When I answer your questions, the power of your heart is strengthened because your mind begins to accept the truth and light in the answer, and to surrender to your heart. When the mind does not fight against it so much, the heart becomes stronger. That is why I answer questions — to convince the mind. Otherwise, very often the mind will refuse to see the light or feel the light or become one with the light that the heart offers it.</p>

How can we be aware enough inside us to know the questions that we have?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know the source of our questions. If the source of the questions is the intellectual, sophisticated mind, or the physical mind, then these questions have no ultimate value. Even if they are answered most adequately, the answers will be of no use in your inner life. When it is a matter of your heart, there is only one question that can come from the heart, from the inmost recesses of your heart, and that is: "Who am I?" This is the only question truly worth asking and worth answering. It is a question which has to be answered every day, every second in our existence. If you have millions of questions about God and about yourself, you will be able to get most adequate answers to all of them by getting the proper answer to this one question: "Who am I?" All the other questions revolve around this question. When you know the answer to this question, your life's problems are solved. You enter into liberation, salvation, Self-realisation. You become totally and consciously one with God the Omnipotent, God the Omniscient, and God the All-Perfect.</p>
<p>Do not bother to search for questions deep inside yourself. Most questions are like ants and bugs. They do not help us in any way to approach our Goal. On the contrary, they stand in our way. Illumining questions, questions that come from the very depth of our heart concerning our inner progress and inner achievement, our self-realisation or God-realisation, are very few in number. Besides asking, "Who am I?" you may want to know the answer to the question, "What am I here for?" You may also have various specific questions about your own spiritual progress, which are bound to come to you spontaneously. But the only really important question is, "Who am I?"</p>
