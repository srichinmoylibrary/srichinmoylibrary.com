<p>A friend of Gandhi's once needed money and asked Gandhi if he could help him. Gandhi first said, "I have no money." Then he conceded, "All right, I will try my best."</p>
<p>Gandhi stole a piece of gold from his brother and sold it. He then gave the money to his friend. Afterwards, he felt miserable that he had stolen something.</p>
<p>He always used to tell his father everything. He did not keep any secrets from him. Although his father was very sick and bedridden, Gandhi wrote him a note, saying, "I stole a piece of gold and I feel very sad and miserable. Please forgive me."</p>
<p>As soon as his father read the note, he immediately got up from his bed. Gandhi was afraid he was going to strike him. But there were tears in his father's eyes. Then Gandhi thought that his father was very sad that his son had stolen something from his own brother. So he felt even more miserable. Finally, his father tore up the note and there were more tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Gandhi assured his father, "Father, I will never steal anymore. This is my first and last time. Please do not cry."</p>
<p>His father was so moved that he cried and cried. "I am crying, son, not because you have stolen something but because of your sincerity. You are always so truthful. I have never seen anybody as sincere as you. I am crying because of your sincerity, not because you have committed a theft. I am so proud of your sincerity and honesty."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gandhi and the goat&#039;s meat</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gandhi and the goat&#039;s meat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When he was thirteen, Gandhi got married to a girl of the same age. The two were extremely fond of each other. When Gandhi was about eighteen, he wanted to go to Europe to continue his college studies. By that time, his father had died and his mother was in charge of his life. Gandhi's relatives also wanted Gandhi to go to Europe and they requested his mother to send her son. But she was very worried. She said, "No, no. If I send him to Europe, he will be ruined. Now he is so close to me. There he will start drinking, eating meat and mixing with women."</p>
<p>Gandhi promised his mother that he would not drink, eat meat or mix with women, and he did keep his promise. After getting his degree in law, he came home. On his return he found that his mother had died.</p>
<p>Gandhi had a Muslim friend who always tried to persuade him to eat meat. "No," Gandhi would answer him. "Hindus don't eat meat, especially my caste. My ancestors never ate meat."</p>
<p>But the friend insisted. "If you don't eat meat, you will remain weak. You have to eat meat if you want to be physically strong."</p>
<p>Gandhi very much wanted to be physically strong. "Are you sure it will make me strong?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied his Muslim friend.</p>
<p>Since Gandhi was very weak, one evening he tried some goat's meat. That night Gandhi saw that the goat was crying inside his stomach. The goat was so miserable.</p>
<p>Gandhi cried, "I can't eat meat anymore! I have seen the goat crying inside me." And he gave up eating meat forever.</p>
<p>But he was fond of goat's milk, and he used to drink it. "One can take goat's milk," he used to say, "but not goat's meat."</p>

<p>Gandhi was once working as a lawyer in South Africa. He wanted to be economical, since everything was very expensive there. Since the washermen used to charge very high amounts, Gandhi thought of washing his clothes himself. He read a few books about how to wash clothes properly, how to iron and so forth.</p>
<p>One day, while he was washing his clothes, he used too much starch on a particular tie. Then he did not press it properly. That day, when he went to court, his friends noticed something funny about his tie and began laughing.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" they asked. "Why is starch falling from your tie?"</p>
<p>Gandhi said, "You are making fun of me. I am giving you joy. It is not an easy task to give people joy. Right now I am learning to wash clothes. I badly want to save money and washermen are charging very high prices. Soon I will become an expert, but now I am giving you joy, so I am very happy. It is a difficult thing to give others joy, but I am doing it. Therefore, I am proud of myself."</p>

<p>One day Gandhi went to an English barber to have his hair cut. But the barber said to him, "You black man, I won't cut your hair! Go away."</p>
<p>Gandhi was unhappy, but he was, as always, forgiving. So he said, "He is right. If he cuts my hair, who knows what will happen? We are all the time fighting against the British. They feel we are inferior people. Perhaps his boss will fire him if he cuts my hair. After all, our barbers will not cut the hair of someone of a low caste. According to the British, we are inferior. That's why the British barber is not cutting my hair. What can I do? I shall not go to another barber for more insults."</p>
<p>So Gandhi cut his own hair. He stood in front of a mirror and started with the front. The front came out well, but the back was not so good.</p>
<p>The next day, when Gandhi came to court, everybody laughed and laughed. "Why didn't you go to a barber?" they asked.</p>
<p>"One barber has already insulted me," Gandhi said. "He is absolutely right. Why should he cut my hair? All right, make fun of me. One day I will learn to cut hair and wash things also. I want to be self-sufficient. When I am self-sufficient, I will be really happy. I am sure you are happy now because you are making fun of me and I am happy that I can give you joy. But a day will come when you will be proud of me. I will learn how to cut hair by myself. I want to be self-sufficient in all ways. Today my incapacity is making you happy. Some day my capacity will make you happy."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">You have proved to be my real wife</h2><span property="dc:title" content="You have proved to be my real wife" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Gandhi was returning to India from South Africa. Many friends and many lawyers came to his farewell party to say goodbye to him and his family. The family received very expensive gifts and Gandhi's wife and sons were especially delighted.</p>
<p>Gandhi was always renouncing things, so he said, "Why are they giving me these things? They only bind me, and I want to be free. I really want to give away most of these things; I want to give away anything that I don't need."</p>
<p>The wife and sons said, "We do need some things. Please do not give away everything."</p>
<p>Then Gandhi saw that someone had given some very expensive and beautiful jewellery to his wife. "I can't keep this," he told her.</p>
<p>"This jewellery was given to me," she said, "not to you."</p>
<p>But Gandhi said, "It is because of me that they know you. Otherwise, they would not have given you this."</p>
<p>The wife said, "Why did I come into your life? There are so many people on earth, but it is I who was chosen to be your wife. This kind of argument will never end. I won't give up this jewellery."</p>
<p>The children took the side of their father. "Because of Father you got the jewellery. Now you have to give it up."</p>
<p>The wife became furious. "I won't give it away."</p>
<p>But Gandhi said, "Tomorrow I will take this expensive jewellery and sell it, and put the money in the bank. The money will be only for those who love their country and serve their country. They will take money from that bank and spend it to liberate their country, but not for anything else."</p>
<p>The children again took their father's side. "It is an excellent idea, Father! Let us do it!"</p>
<p>The wife said, "You fools! You are siding with your father, but I need this jewellery for you, for your wives. Your father gives away everything. What are you going to have for your own families?"</p>
<p>The children laughed and laughed. "We don't have to think of that right now. It is too early."</p>
<p>Finally Gandhi's wife said, "All right, I don't need it either. Since your father has renounced everything, I do not need this either."</p>
<p>Gandhi said, "At last you have proved to be my real wife."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gandhi&#039;s ashram</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gandhi&#039;s ashram" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>After he left Africa and returned to India, Mahatma Gandhi opened up an ashram at the request of his close friends. The immediate members of his family and a few friends went to live in the ashram. There they led a very simple, pious life and they prayed and meditated.</p>
<p>The ashram was supported by rich merchants who used to come on many occasions. So the ashram was doing well, and everybody was happy that such a good ashram existed.</p>
<p>One day, Gandhi received a letter from a schoolteacher. "I will be so glad and grateful if you allow me to stay at your ashram with my wife and child. I will do anything you want me to do." At the end of the letter the teacher wrote, "Only one thing I hesitate to tell you, but I must be sincere with you. I am an untouchable."</p>
<p>When Gandhi read this, he buried his head in his hands. "O God, I love the untouchables, for they are God's children. But now my family will be furious. How can I allow this man at the ashram? On the other hand, how can I refuse him? He has written such a soulful letter. My heart breaks."</p>
<p>Gandhi spoke to the members of his family about the matter. They were so nice. "If you want to have this man here, definitely invite him to join us," they said.</p>
<p>Still Gandhi hesitated. "The merchants who support the ashram are very fanatic. They belong to society, and they will worry about what society will think of them." Then Gandhi said, "No, I will allow this teacher to work and live here at the ashram."</p>
<p>The untouchable came to the ashram. As soon as the merchants heard about this, they stopped giving money to Gandhi. They said, "You are ruining society. You come from a good family, a good caste. How can you do this kind of thing? We will not give you money in support of such an unthinkable thing."</p>
<p>Gandhi told them, "All right, do not give us money. But if somebody sincerely and soulfully wants to serve this ashram, I will allow him. Untouchables are God's children also."</p>
<p>Soon Gandhi ran into financial difficulty. One day, while walking along the street, he saw a merchant with a carriage. The merchant approached him and said, "I am a rich merchant who used to help support your ashram. Since you let an untouchable into your ashram, I have been unable to help you, because I am afraid of what my friends might say. My heart is one with you, but I have to live in society. You are above society, so you can welcome an untouchable into your community. But I want to give you money secretly. Please promise me that you will not tell anyone about this."</p>
<p>Gandhi promised him, "I won't tell a soul about this."</p>
<p>The merchant said, "Then tomorrow come here and I will give you a very large amount of money."</p>
<p>Gandhi believed the merchant and the following day he returned to the same place. The merchant did come and he gave him a very large amount of money. Gandhi did not even know the man's name, since many merchants had helped his ashram, and he did not know all of them personally. Gandhi asked him his name, but the merchant wouldn't tell him. "Please," the merchant said, "I can't give you my name. Yours is a noble cause and I fully agree with you. But I have to live in society, so this must remain a secret. You are doing the right thing; therefore, I am supporting your cause. But it is not necessary for you to know my name."</p>
<p>On that day, Gandhi's fate changed.</p>

<p>Tagore and Gandhi are two immortals. They were extremely good friends and they had tremendous appreciation and admiration for each other. Tagore used to call Gandhi "Mahatma," which means great soul, and Gandhi used to call Tagore "Gurudev"-spiritual Teacher, Master of inner wisdom and light.</p>
<p>Once, in front of many people, they were having a simple discussion. Unfortunately, the discussion became very heated. Some people took Tagore's side, while others took Gandhi's side. A great artist named Nandalal Bose happened to be there, so people asked him which side he was on.</p>
<p>"We are taking sides," they said, "so you must take one side."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," the artist replied. "Please do not ask me to take sides."</p>
<p>Still, everyone wanted to hear his opinion. "You must be in agreement with either Gandhi or Tagore. We are curious to know what you are thinking," they said.</p>
<p>Again Nandalal Bose said, "I can't take any side."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" they asked him. "Don't you have a mind of your own?"</p>
<p>Finally Nandalal Bose said, "I am an artist. If you ask me which colour I like most, I have to say that I feel that all colours are good; to me they are all excellent. Here, I have great admiration for these two, so for me both of them are right. I won't take either side. Both Tagore and Gandhi are right."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gandhi Buri&#039;s supreme sacrifice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gandhi Buri&#039;s supreme sacrifice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was an extremely patriotic old lady who was 73 years old. She was the greatest admirer of Mahatma Gandhi; his very name used to give her a sea of inspiration. She wanted the British government to leave India, and she did many patriotic things that were extremely inspiring to the women of India. Because of this lady's deep admiration for Mahatma Gandhi, everyone used to call her "Gandhi Buri," "buri" meaning "old lady."</p>
<p>In 1942, Gandhi was arrested and all of India became furious. In many places people held processions, using the slogan "Quit India", which was Mahatma Gandhi's offering to his brothers and sisters of India. The day after Gandhi's arrest, Gandhi Buri was involved in a march to a police station. The people in the procession wanted to take down the British flag, the Union Jack, from over the police station and hoist up the Indian flag.</p>
<p>The police stood in the way and warned the protestors that if they came forward one more step, they would shoot.</p>
<p>All the marchers stopped except Gandhi Buri. She snatched India's flag from one of the young boys in the procession and ran towards the police station. The police first laughed at her. "Enough, enough! No more! Go away from here, old woman. We don't want to kill you," they shouted.</p>
<p>But Gandhi Buri cried, "Kill me, I am not afraid of you. I want to free my Mother India."</p>
<p>She ran towards the staircase that led to the top of the police station. Before she reached the stairs, the police shot her. With her right hand she was still holding the flag as she chanted a few times, "Bande Mataram, Bande Mataram, Bande Mataram" (Mother, I bow to Thee). Then she left the body.</p>
<p>This old lady of 73 years was so courageous that she gave her life for her beloved country. There were some young boys in the procession who were shouting and screaming things against the British, but when the time came for them to sacrifice their lives, they hesitated. But Gandhi Buri devotedly and proudly gave her life. From that day on, people who were in that procession became more inspired to dedicate their lives totally to the freedom of India.</p>
