  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you speak of the heart as being the centre of love and the place where the soul resides, do you mean the physical heart, or is &#039;heart&#039; just a term that you use?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you speak of the heart as being the centre of love and the place where the soul resides, do you mean the physical heart, or is &#039;heart&#039; just a term that you use?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am not speaking of the human heart, the physical heart, which is just another organ, or the emotional heart, which is really the vital. I am speaking of the pure heart, the spiritual heart. Some spiritual Masters say that the spiritual heart is in the centre of the chest; some say that it is located a little to the right; some say to the left. There is even one spiritual teacher who says that the heart is a little above the centre of the eyebrows at the place we call the third eye. How can a spiritual Master say this? Because the illumined third eye is light, and the illumined heart is also all light. But according to my own realisation, the spiritual heart is located in the centre of the chest, in the centre of our existence.</p>
<p>The heart is like the commander-in-chief, while the soul is the king. When the soul comes into existence, its first concern is to illumine the heart. When the soul withdraws from the body, automatically the commander-in-chief loses all his power. The heart wants to stay with its king. It does not want to go and join another king or another army. In the outer world our friends may deceive us; but in the case of the soul and the heart, their intimacy is thicker than the thickest. The physical sometimes does not listen to the soul. The mind and the vital may ignore it. But the heart is always faithful to the soul. The heart also knows how to identify itself with others' hearts. The mother does not have to show her love for her child by saying, "I love you, I love you," because the mother's identification with the child makes the child feel that he is loved. The real heart does not need to convince; it has the power of oneness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your consciousness is now in the heart centre. This is the centre of pure love and oneness. Formerly, your consciousness was in the mind. When you stay in the mind, all of life can seem like a dry piece of wood. But when you stay in the heart, life can be turned into a sea of pure love and bliss. Since you have been coming here your consciousness has begun functioning more from your heart centre than from your mind centre. If you can keep it there, you will gradually begin to experience a spontaneous feeling of oneness. If you can cultivate the spiritual soil of the heart, you will find growing there spontaneous love, spontaneous oneness with God and God's creation.</p>
<p>In the heart love is really pure and it flows abundantly. From the navel centre love also flows abundantly, but it is filled with impurity. And from below the navel, in addition to being impure, love flows in an insignificant measure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is spiritual dryness inevitable?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is spiritual dryness inevitable?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spiritual dryness is inevitable only when we do not approach God with sufficient love and devotion. If we approach God with the mind, there will be dryness. But if we approach God with the heart and the soul, there can be no dryness, only a constant shower of love and Grace. We feel our love flowing to God and God's Grace constantly being showered on us. If we approach God with the mind, for one second we may see that Grace is pouring down. Then for four days or four months there will be no rain at all.</p>
<p>Those who know how to cry for God Himself — and not just for God's gifts — from the depths of their heart will feel that there is no dryness. But those who want to approach God with knowledge and intellect will always suffer from dryness. Many aspirants and even great spiritual teachers have gone through this spiritual dryness. Then on the strength of their own experiences, they say that there is no one who has not had the experience of spiritual drought. But fortunately I cannot see eye to eye with them. I approached the Supreme with love, devotion and surrender and I wish to say that I never, never experienced spiritual dryness. Constantly I basked in the shower of His infinite Grace.</p>
<p>If you want to live in God's infinite Grace, then you have to approach God with love, devotion and surrender. You have to offer yourself entirely to the Supreme, and this self-offering must be through the heart and not through the mind. If you can do this, then there will be no dryness. Constantly, at every moment, you will be fed by the Supreme. What you call dryness, in spiritual terms I call starvation. We starve spiritually just because we do not allow the soul to come to the fore and take care of us. We do just the reverse. We tell the soul that we can not only take care of ourselves but also are ready to take care of it as well. This is our mistake. Let us allow the soul to take care of our outer existence. Then we shall see that our inner hunger will be fed by God's infinite Grace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual heart is located right in the centre of the chest. Within the heart the soul abides. The soul permeates the whole body, but it abides in the heart, just as a man lives in a house, but stays most of the time in one certain room. One can feel the spiritual heart when one is aspiring intensely and one can also see it with the third eye. Every day each aspirant should concentrate on the heart and nowhere else. He has to feel that he does not have a head, he does not have legs, he does not have arms; he has only the heart. An aspirant can reach his spiritual heart through constant concentration and meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I become my heart and remain in my heart at every second?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I become my heart and remain in my heart at every second?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are three ways in which you can become your heart. The first way is to feel that you have spread a net, in which the entire world is caught. You have caught everyone, not to punish them, not to hurt them, but to play with them. You will give them joy and they will give you joy. When you think of playing a game, you become the heart. The heart is joy, play is joy, the game is joy and the player is joy. To become only the heart, you have to feel that there is somebody playing with you constantly and eternally, and that person is God. According to our Indian conception, God is an eternal Child, and all spiritual Masters also have a childlike nature. It is sometimes said that the first and foremost sign of a spiritual Master is that he has the heart of a child. Of course, this means a spiritual child, a divine child, an illumined child, and not an ordinary child.</p>
<p>The second way to become the heart is to feel that inside you there is a divine Child and that is the soul. You can constantly think that inside your heart is a Child who is most luminous, infinitely more beautiful than any human being. The eternal Child needs an abode, a house, a room. Where is His room? It is inside your heart. First think of the Child, and then think of His needs. He needs a place to live and your heart is the most perfect abode.</p>
<p>The third way to feel that you are the heart is to constantly feel your need and God's need. Your need is perfection. If you can think of perfection, meditate on perfection, cry for perfection, then your need will be fulfilled. God's need is manifestation. In spite of your imperfection He is manifesting Himself, but when He can manifest in and through your perfection, then He will have real fulfilment. When God is fulfilling Himself in and through you, that is your real fulfilment and His real fulfilment. At that time you are nothing else but the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we learn to love God with all our heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we learn to love God with all our heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, let us try to know what heart means. The spiritual heart is the sweetest and most intimate part of us. We can expect it to have the feeling of immediate, indivisible oneness with God. Right now, our physical existence separates us from our heart-consciousness. Also, the mind is using us and, therefore, the heart is not being allowed to come to the fore. Again, sometimes we use the vital and think it is the heart that we are using. In order to give our heart's love to the Supreme, we have first to identify ourselves with the true heart. Next, we have to feel that our heart is composed of only one thing: gratitude. We must feel our oneness with the heart and we must feel that we have become gratitude itself. If somebody calls our name, our inner being will not respond. But if somebody says the word 'gratitude', immediately we will feel that he is calling us and nobody else.</p>
<p>This gratitude is for whom? It is for the Supreme. The moment we can feel that our inner existence and outer existence have only one name, gratitude, we will be able to offer our heart's love to the Supreme totally, implicitly and ceaselessly. Why do we have to offer gratitude to the Supreme? Because God has given us the greatest blessing imaginable. He has given us the aspiration to lead a spiritual life and realise Him. There are billions of people on earth who do not have that urge to realise God, for they have not yet received this blessing unparalleled. We are beginning our conscious inner journey before they are and we will also reach the Goal long before they do.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have a heart as vast as Jesus Christ&#039;s?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have a heart as vast as Jesus Christ&#039;s?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know that there is a great difference between the heart of Jesus Christ and that of an ordinary human being. But the person who is ordinary today, in God's tomorrow can have a heart as vast as Jesus Christ's. Who gave Jesus Christ that vast heart? Who gave Lord Buddha such a vast heart? God did. If God can give Christ and Buddha and Krishna such a vast heart, He can also give you the same kind of heart if He wants to.</p>
<p>One day you feel a vast heart within yourself and you want to become one with the world and show sympathy to the world. But the next day, if you do not have the same feeling, or the same capacity to feel oneness, do not feel sorry. If you do, you will be making a mistake. From this so-called sadness, very soon jealousy will come forward. When you become jealous, you begin cursing yourself and doubting yourself. You say, "What have I done wrong that what I had a few days ago today I no longer have?" Next you begin to think that God is partial. You think, "He did not give me the capacity permanently. He has given this capacity to somebody else now."</p>
<p>But God will not leave anybody unrealised. Everybody has to realise the Highest. It is only a matter of time. You will realise God tomorrow; somebody else may take two hundred years; somebody else may take four hundred years. But if the one that will take four hundred years feels sorry that tomorrow you are going to realise God, his sadness is not going to help him at all. If the fastest runner wins and I feel sad when I observe him, this will not be of any help to me. He has the capacity, so he will win. I do not have the capacity, so I will not win. But if I can appreciate his speed, automatically some of his capacity will enter into me. Through sincere appreciation we gain capacity. So if you see that somebody has a big heart, the heart of a Christ, if you can appreciate and admire him all the time, by your appreciation and identification you automatically enlarge the power and capacity of your own heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since I am your spiritual Master, please feel that the infinite Consciousness is within me. You have entered into the spiritual life and at every moment you are dealing with consciousness. My name, although it was given to me by my parents, actually means 'full of divine consciousness.' Think of my name during the day, and feel that when you think of me you are thinking of one particular thing in your life, and that is consciousness. By 'me' I mean the Supreme in me. When you think of consciousness you are bound to feel expansion, because the very nature of consciousness is to expand. If you think of consciousness, immediately you will feel inside you a vast ocean or a vast sky.</p>
<p>Your question is how you can expand your heart in order to have me with you constantly. If you look at the ocean, you will see a vast expanse of water. Water signifies consciousness. If you look at the sky, you will see an infinite expanse of blue. Blue signifies Infinity. If you can look at the ocean or the sky early in the morning just for a few minutes and feel that your heart and my consciousness have become one there, your heart will definitely expand. Then, whenever you think of me, if you can think of that vastness too, in this way you will achieve your goal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel all the time that the physical is not all, and that the spiritual is everything. Inside the physical is the spiritual. Outside is the body, but just because you have the heart inside, you are alive. In the spiritual life the heart and soul are most important. My presence must be inside you.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual life is not the life of indifference. However, one has to have discrimination when dealing with the world. If you give your heart to everyone, irrespective of who the person is, then people may exploit you. If a thief wants to buy tools to steal with, and if someone with a magnanimous heart gives him the money without questioning what kind of person he is or why he wants the money, who will be partially responsible for his future thefts? The man who gives money to the thief. A spiritual person may have a truly wide heart, but to utilise the heart's quality with wisdom is more important than to cry for the enlargement of the heart.</p>
<p>God has already given our heart many divine qualities, but we do not use them and thus we slow down our spiritual growth. Very few people, I must say, know what the spiritual heart really is. What we mistake for the heart is actually the emotional vital. This moment we want to give everything to a person and the next moment we want to keep everything for ourselves. This moment, for no reason, I am ready to give everything to you and the next moment, again for no reason, I am ready to take your life away. This kind of feeling does not come from the heart at all. It is the play of our demanding, unfulfilled vital that we are seeing.</p>
<p>If our vital is trying to play the role of the heart, it will try to dominate others or make them feel that they need us badly because we have wisdom or light, whereas they do not. But the very existence of the heart is based on identification. Identification is light. The spiritual heart can identify only with light and delight, for it gets continuous light and delight from the soul. We may identify with someone's sorrow, but what we are actually identifying ourselves with is the light inside that sorrow. Inside pain, inside suffering, inside darkness itself, there is light. Ultimately, the heart is identifying with the light within. If we cry every day for our own inner light, then we will see that the heart is bound to expand. But if we want to expand the heart without light, we will merely expand our ignorance. Only when we cry for the Highest will our heart really expand.</p>
<p>We must realise that the vital, which is deceiving and exploiting us, must be put aside. Very often forces from the impure vital, below the navel, enter into our heart and cause us to suffer. Purification of the vital is absolutely necessary if the vital wants to act divinely, together with the heart. Otherwise, the heart will have to play its part alone. But please be careful in dealing with humanity, that you do not offer the false light of the demanding and possessive vital. In the name of concern, we very often offer worries, anxieties, impurities and so forth.</p>
<p>It is not at all difficult to bring forward the heart's good qualities such as sympathy and concern. We can bring forward these good qualities through our aspiration. We are aspiring for God, who undoubtedly has more Concern, Affection and all other qualities of the heart than we have. Our sincere aspiration can bring these qualities down from God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you conquer attachment when you have a large heart and want to help people?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you conquer attachment when you have a large heart and want to help people?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have a big heart and you want to help hundreds of people, you have to remember to whom these people belong. They don't belong to you; they belong to the Supreme. Since they are His possessions, you have to make sure that the Supreme wants you to help them. If you want to help them just to show your outer capacity, the only significant result will be an increase in your pride and vanity. But if you are commissioned by God, God can give you the heart and the capacity to help not only a hundred or two hundred people, but millions of people at a time.</p>
<p>How can you be detached if you have a big heart? If it is God's Will that you should help and He has given you some capacity, some illumination, some inner wisdom and light, then you will easily be able to be detached. But if your desire to serve the world is not God's Will, if it is coming unconsciously from your vital, then you are bound to be attached. If your desire to help others is coming consciously from the vital, then you will know that your wish to help people is only for appreciation, admiration and fame.</p>
<p>Very often people do not know the difference between the heart and the vital, because the vital is near the heart. The spiritual heart is in the centre of the chest and the vital is at the navel and below. From the navel the consciousness flows upward, and people think it is the consciousness of the heart. The emotionally and physically impure vital consciousness flows outward and people think that it is the heart's consciousness purifying and illumining the whole world. The vital emotion always creates attachment, but people are convinced that this is their heart's concern. Attachment is killing them, but they do not understand what it is. They think they are suffering because of their heart's concern for others.</p>
<p>Unless one aspires, it is very difficult to know the difference between vital attachment or vital love and true psychic love or the heart's divine love. The capacity for discrimination comes through gradual spiritual progress. Spiritual Masters can tell the difference and sincere seekers who have made considerable progress can tell. But others will always make a mistake. On rare occasions they will recognise their vital emotions, but most of the time they will feel that their pure heart is making them suffer.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we feel that we are more than ready to go and illumine the world, our readiness is not readiness at all. What we call readiness, in God's Eye may be our egotistical way of imagining our own greatness. At that time, we will go from one end of the earth to the other offering our light, but this light will not be real light; it is all human ego coming directly from the vital world. So we have to be very careful. Real readiness is there only when God tells us to do something, for God can see when we are really ready. When we are ready, God will speak through the Master and tell us that we are ready. Only then can the wealth of the heart be offered to mankind in a divine way.</p>
<p>So always go deep within and wait for the inner light or the Master to guide you and command you. You will be making a mistake if you think that you have the capacity to serve the world divinely but that you are not getting the opportunity to use it. Use all your capacity first to realise the highest Truth. When you have realised this Truth, you will find deep within you One who will tell you when the time has come for you to spread your light by helping the world. At that time you will never be attached. You will feel that you are consciously becoming one with your other part and you will have the capacity to grow into this larger part. As long as you do not have this capacity, when you give to somebody else you will always feel that you are superior, that he is a beggar and you are a prince. But when you are illumined and have been commanded by God to help others, you will see the other person as your own extended self. There will be no sense of separativity at that time, only oneness and expansion. When there is total oneness there is no attachment. It is the feeling of duality that creates attachment. In the infinite ocean there are millions of waves, but these waves are all part and parcel of the ocean. The millions of waves are the expression, the revelation, the manifestation of the ocean. There is no duality, no attachment here; it is all oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible for the physical mind to try to veil the gratitude of the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible for the physical mind to try to veil the gratitude of the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not only is it possible, but it happens almost constantly. The physical mind is veiling the gratitude of the heart almost every day and, in some cases, twenty-four hours a day. Atheists do not believe in God, although God has given them a soul, given them life, given them opportunity, and is still caring for them and giving them Compassion and Concern. But for them there is no God. With their mental development and sophistication, doubt and other undivine qualities have entered into them. For rich people also there is often no God, although God has blessed them with His Bounty. For them, money is their God. That is all they aspire for. These people also have a heart, but the gratitude of that heart is veiled by the physical mind.</p>
<p>The physical mind is constantly crying for possession, and not for liberation. But the heart always has the feeling of oneness. In the heart, you and I are of the same status. I am in no way superior to you; you are in no way superior to me. But when we live in the physical mind, immediately we are separated. Either I am superior or I am inferior; we cannot be one. The physical mind, which is full of imperfection, limitation and bondage, will always try to separate us from our reality. Our reality is the soul and that soul is inside the heart. The physical mind we have to catch and control like a thief. We have to catch the mind with our intense aspiration and we have to control it with our willpower. And finally we have to illumine it with our soul's light.</p>
<p>We can unveil the heart's gratitude the moment we are successful in bringing to the fore our soul, which is full of divine light. And to bring the soul to the fore we have to feel that our whole existence is in the heart itself. We have to feel that our entire concentration is inside the heart, not on the top of the head or in the forehead or anywhere else. When we focus our attention on the heart, we have to feel that there is a divine spark, a most beautiful and luminous child trying to come forward. Like the sun in the sky, many times it is eclipsed by clouds. But when the sun finally does come forward, darkness is totally melted away. If we can focus our attention on the heart, slowly and steadily we will see the inner sun — which is infinitely more brilliant, more powerful, more luminous than the physical sun — come forward and illumine our outer consciousness. At that time the physical mind will be transformed by the infinite Light within us. Then, instead of standing in the way, the mind itself will become a conscious instrument of the heart and the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: It&#039;s sometimes said that America has a big heart. Do you find that Americans live more in the heart than Europeans, for example?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It&#039;s sometimes said that America has a big heart. Do you find that Americans live more in the heart than Europeans, for example?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Aspiration is everywhere, but to be very frank with you, in some countries it is more intense than in others. The difficulty with Europeans, for example, is that most of them are too mental. The mind can be a very good instrument, but right now it is not. The mind that is used now is the physical mind which constantly doubts and suspects. It is very limited and full of darkness. But there is also a higher mind, an illumined mind, an intuitive mind, an overmind. These levels of mind are not being used right now. To bring them into use, first we have to live in the heart and bring light to the mind. My philosophy is psychic — from the heart — so many Europeans find it difficult to appreciate it. But Americans either live more in the heart or more in the vital, so it is not as difficult for them.</p>
<p>The heart is at the centre of the chest, and the vital is just below. The distance is quite short. But the mind is up in the head, so there is a big distance. Naturally, it is easier for the light of the heart to enter into the vital than to enter into the mind. Then again, there are two types of vital: the dynamic vital and the aggressive vital. The American vital is usually dynamic and not aggressive, and this is very fortunate. The dynamic vital is important and helpful in the spiritual life, whereas the aggressive vital is damaging and destructive. In various parts of the world the aggressive vital has come to the fore, but in America I see the dynamic vital most of the time. But even in this respect, Americans are still imperfect. Dynamism and aggression very often mix in the vital. The vital is like a knife. With a knife we can cut a fruit and share it with others and with the same knife we can stab someone. So we have to be very careful that the dynamic vital does not become the aggressive vital.</p>
<p>In America and other places where I have noticed dynamism, I have hope. There are places where there is no dynamism and for their spiritual progress I have very little hope at this time. If we are dynamic, we make progress, we run. If we do not know where our goal is, then we may run from this side to that side, but it is better to move than to remain static. Otherwise, we will make no progress at all. There are many parts of the world where most of the people are wallowing in the pleasures of idleness, lethargy, apathy. This, unfortunately, is India's great problem. But Americans are running. They are not sure of the goal, but they are constantly on the move. They go one way and dash against a wall and get hurt. But then they realise that the goal is not there, so they go another way. If that is also not the proper direction, they get another blow. But they go on. So by trial and error they make progress.</p>
<p>The thing that I deeply appreciate and admire in America is that America does not know how to hesitate or stand still. This is an excellent quality in the spiritual life. Our Goal is not where we are now; our Goal is somewhere ahead of us, so why should we stay in one place? Once we know our Goal, or even if we are not sure of our Goal, still we have to run. God's Compassion will dawn because of our dynamic aspiration, and guide us to our Goal.</p>
<p>Another good quality which I see in Americans is that they can appreciate everything, like children. A child appreciates everything and God also appreciates everything, for God is a divine Child. America has a big heart, a spontaneous heart, a child's heart. America makes mistakes. Who does not make mistakes? But in the matter of the heart's magnanimity and the vital's dynamism, America is very advanced.</p>
