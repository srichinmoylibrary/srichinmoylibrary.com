<p><em>(The home of Ratan and Rohini. The Master has come to visit them and is playing with their daughter, Rula.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Rula, Rula, today you look so pretty. I see a necklace of pearls around your neck. You look so beautiful, so beautiful.</p>
<p>RATAN: Oh Master, it is all due to your grace. We had little money, little material prosperity before you came into our lives. Our wealth is all due to your grace.</p>
<p>ROHINI: We depend entirely on you, Master. It is your grace that has made us rich. It is your grace that has made us happy. It is your grace that will help us accomplish everything we wish to accomplish here on earth. We are so grateful to you. We shall do everything, everything, everything for you, Master.</p>
<p><em>(Master blesses the couple.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: I am indeed proud of both of you. <em>(To Rohini.)</em> Please make me a most delicious meal today. I have not had the pleasure of eating one of your meals for a long time. You feel that I am a great Master, but I feel that I am a great eater.</p>
<p>ROHINI: Master, you eat our food, which takes an hour or two to prepare; but the food that you give us would have taken us centuries to get without your help. There is no comparison between your food and ours. When we eat your food, our life becomes constant gratitude to you. Where else can we get Peace, Light and Bliss if not from you?</p>
<p>MASTER: That is true, but we need each other. The disciple needs the Master, and the Master needs the disciple. <em>(To Ratan.)</em> I shall go out for a walk with Rula. We will be back in half an hour. In the meantime, please help Rohini prepare the meal.</p>
<p>ROHINI: Master, I shall do my best to make a most delicious meal for you. If you like my food, what more do I need on earth? For my Master to say that he likes my food means that I possess Heaven right here on earth.</p>
<p><em>(Master smiles. Ratan and Rohini bow to him with folded hands.)</em></p>

<p>MASTER <em>(suddenly)</em>: Rula, please give me your necklace. It is so beautiful. I wish to have it. I shall give you something more beautiful than this one, much more beautiful, in return.</p>
<p>RULA: No, I want to keep this one. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Let me see the one you have that is better than this.</p>
<p>MASTER: Today you give me this one and tomorrow I shall bring you the new one.</p>
<p>RULA: No, I won’t give it to you. Give me the better one first and then I shall give you this one.</p>
<p>MASTER: If you don’t give it to me I shall take it away and leave you here, and you will have to go home all alone.</p>
<p><em>(Rula starts to cry.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Stop crying!</p>
<p><em>(Rula cries louder.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(aside)</em>: I need money badly. I could sell this necklace for thousands of rupees, but how can I get it away from this stubborn child? She is making so much noise that I shall be caught. I'll have to kill her. Then I can take the necklace and leave the city.</p>
<p><em>(As the Master grabs Rule, she starts to scream. He strangles her. When she loses consciousness, he snatches the necklace and runs away, leaving the child lying senseless on the ground. Enter two neighbours who catch the Master as he is leaving the scene.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: What’s going on here? What’s all the noise about?</p>
<p><em>(They notice the child lying on the ground and discover the necklace which the Master is trying to hide. Putting two and two together, they begin to curse the Master and strike him.)</em></p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOUR: Now tell us! Whose daughter is she?</p>
<p>MASTER: She is the child of Ratan and Rohini.</p>
<p>NEIGHBOURS: Take us there.</p>

<p>RATAN: What are you doing? This is my Guru! And why are you carrying my daughter?</p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: This is your Guru? This rogue? This criminal? Look what he has done! He has killed your daughter to steal her necklace.</p>
<p>RATAN <em>(momentarily shocked, but quickly recovering)</em>: Don’t worry. I know that my Guru has the power to revive her. See, I am touching his feet and praying to him. <em>(Touches Master’s feet.)</em> Oh Guru, save my child. I am sure she is not yet dead; she is just unconscious. You have the power to revive her. Please use your power, dearest Master. Just look at her once and my Rula will be all right.</p>
<p><em>(Master looks at Rula, placing his hands on her. She revives and starts striking him.)</em></p>
<p>RULA: I hate you! You tried to steal my necklace! You hurt me!</p>
<p>RATAN: No, no, Rula. He was just playing a game with you. See, you are not hurt. Look at our Master’s power. He has just shown you a trick.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt Master, Ratan and Rula)</em></p>
<p><em>(Neighbours shrug as they watch them go off together.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST NEIGHBOUR: These Masters are such rogues! Had it been my daughter, I would have killed the man immediately.</p>
<p>SECOND NEIGHBOUR: I would have called the police and had him arrested! But this stupid Ratan has such faith in his Master, even though he’s obviously the world’s worst rogue. Someday something really serious will happen, and then he will learn.</p>

<p><em>(The home of Kadu, another disciple. Enter Master.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: I have come to visit you, Kadu, and I am in a mood to show some of my occult power. You can invite all your friends, relatives and spiritual brothers and sisters. Today I shall perform a miracle. I have never performed any miracles in public, but today I am going to do it since most of you people have no faith in me at all.</p>
<p>KADU: Master, I do have faith in you, I do have faith in you. You don’t have to show me your occult power. But if you want to show it to others, then naturally I shall invite them. Everyone will be very happy and delighted to watch, I am sure.</p>
<p>MASTER: All right, invite them.</p>
<p><em>(Kadu calls his servant. Enter servant bowing.)</em></p>
<p>KADU: Go and invite all my friends and relatives and all my spiritual brothers and sisters. Today Master is going to perform some miracles for us. He is going to use his occult powers. Everyone is invited.</p>
<p><em>(Exit servant. Moments later, enter friends, relatives and other disciples.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to Kadu)</em>: Where is your son, Kavir?</p>
<p>KADU: Oh, he is studying in his room, Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: Bring him here. I wish to see him.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Kadu. Re-enter Kadu, followed by Kavir with folded hands.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Now watch. Here is Kavir. Kavir, I am going to strike you once very hard. You will definitely be knocked unconscious by my blow.</p>
<p>KAVIR: Oh Master, I don’t want to. I don’t want that to happen.</p>
<p>MASTER: Is there anybody here among my disciples who wants to participate in this miracle? After I knock the person unconscious, I will touch his head and revive him.</p>
<p><em>(Several disciples step forward to volunteer.)</em></p>
<p>ONE DISCIPLE: Master, it is such an honour to be struck by you — such a joy, such a source of pride, such an honour!</p>
<p>OTHER DISCIPLES: Please choose me!</p>
<p>KAVIR: No! Master chose me first. I want to be struck by Master. I want to do it.</p>
<p>MASTER: All right, Kavir. Come here.</p>
<p><em>(Master strikes him and Kavir falls down, unconscious. His mother begins to cry.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Now I shall perform the miracle. I am touching his head. <em>(Places his hands on Kavir.)</em> Kavir, arise!</p>
<p><em>(No response from Kavir’s inert body. Onlookers become alarmed.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Somebody get a doctor!</p>
<p>MASTER: No, no! I can do it, I tell you, I can do it. Just the other day I performed this miracle at Ratan and Rohini’s house. Where is Ratan? Ask him to come here. <em>(Exit one of the onlookers to get Ratan.)</em> He will tell you that I did it. He said, “Master, use your power. You have the power.” And I did it. Today I have invited everybody here to watch me, but now this power is not working.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Ratan. The women are crying. The men are terribly angry with the Master.)</em></p>
<p>RATAN: Master, what is the matter? Why aren’t you using your occult power? Please, please do it. I know you have the capacity. You did it for my daughter; you can do it here also. Master, Master, why are you allowing yourself to be embarrassed when you have such tremendous spiritual and occult power? <em>(Ratan touches Master’s feet and pleads.)</em> Master, look at Kavir. Please touch his head. <em>(Master touches Kavir’s head. Kavir immediately gets up and looks around.)</em></p>
<p>KAVIR: Oh Father, where was I? I seemed to be in another world. I saw my mother crying for me. I don’t know where I was, but my mother and father couldn’t see me. Master, I don’t want to play your game anymore.</p>

<p><em>(Master and Ratan are at the home of the Master’s richest disciples.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER <em>(to husband)</em>: You are my richest disciple.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Oh Master, I may be rich on the physical plane, but you are the one who is rich on the spiritual plane.</p>
<p>MASTER: Well, I have come to the richest person on this physical plane. It is my wish to cook for you here today. Your wife has cooked for me many times and her food is always delicious. Now I wish to cook for the two of you. And when your son comes home from school, he can join you.</p>
<p><em>(Husband and wife are overjoyed and full of gratitude. Exit Master to cook. Husband and wife set a table. After a while, enter Master.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Good. I am finished. Now you are the guests, so begin eating. Ratan will help me serve.</p>
<p>WIFE: No, no, Master. How can we allow you to serve us while we eat? Let us wait for you, and we shall all eat together.</p>
<p>MASTER: No, no, no. Obedience comes first in the spiritual life. Since you are my disciples, you have to obey me. We will join you later. Now you start eating.</p>
<p><em>(Master and Ratan begin serving the two disciples. After eating a few morsels of food, both husband and wife collapse onto the floor.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Ratan, I have put poison into their food. <em>(Ratan is shocked and dismayed.)</em> Now we can go upstairs and look for their money. I am sure that they have thousands of rupees hidden away. Let us get the money; then I shall heal them as I have healed others in the past with the help of your prayer. I know that I don’t have any occult power at all. The first time, when I cured Rula, I thought it was my own power that did it. But after trying since then, I came to realise that it is only when you are there to touch my feet that I can do anything at all. It is your faith in me that cures everybody. It is from your faith that I get the capacity to perform miracles. Otherwise, I have no power at all. Now, let us go upstairs and take the money. Then you will pray to me and I shall cure them. You have helped me to do it before. I am sure we will be able to do it this time too.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt omnes)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Dayal. Seeing his parents on the floor, he immediately runs to the door and shouts for the police. Enter two policemen who examine the bodies, look around, then go upstairs. Dayal sits down and buries his face in his hands. Re-enter policemen with Master and Ratan.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST POLICEMAN: You are both under arrest. Let’s go.</p>
<p><em>(Exeunt policemen, Master and Ratan.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Ratan’s house. Dayal is staying with Rohini and Rula while Ratan is in prison.)</em></p>
<p>ROHINI: Dayal, you know that my husband is completely innocent. He did not wish to kill your parents. They were always so kind to us. We were very good friends.</p>
<p>DAYAL: I know it. I know it, Mother Rohini. Uncle Ratan was always extremely good to me. It was because of the Guru that he did it. I do not blame you or my uncle at all. I blame the Master, that rascal! It is because of him that I have lost my parents!</p>
<p>ROHINI: Do not call him a rascal, my child. He is our Master. He knows the kind of experiences we need for our spiritual growth. You have lost your parents, and I have lost my two friends and my husband. I know that your loss is infinitely worse than mine. How can I console you, sweetest Dayal? Only God can comfort you, and I am sure He will. The ever-compassionate Father will certainly console you.</p>

<p><em>(A few weeks later. The Master and Ratan are in the prison yard doing hard labour. The sergeant of the work gang is standing guard.)</em></p>
<p>RATAN <em>(to sergeant)</em>: Please, please allow me to do two men’s jobs. I don’t want my Master to have to do this kind of work. I would be so grateful if you allowed me to do his work.</p>
<p>SERGEANT: You fool! Just because of him you are now here. You are an innocent fellow. He has exploited you, you fool! He is a rogue, a real criminal! You will be freed one day, but not that shameless creature! Never!</p>
<p>RATAN: Call me a fool, say anything you want against me, but please don’t criticise my Master. He is everything to me. My heart breaks to see him here in prison, but it pains me even more to see him working like a labourer. He is not in the habit of doing this kind of work.</p>

<p><em>(Rohini, Rula and Dayal come to visit the Master and Ratan in prison. Rula runs toward her father, stretching out her little arms to him.)</em></p>
<p>RULA: Father, Father, when will you come back home? Everybody says that you are innocent. Everybody says it is Master who has done wrong and gotten you in trouble.</p>
<p>RATAN: Hold your tongue, Rula. He is my Master: he is my all. One more word against him and I shall thrash you. I am sure your mother has told you all this nonsense.</p>
<p>ROHINI <em>(bursting into tears)</em>: No, no, my Lord, I have not. I told her nothing. She has been hearing about our Master from our neighbours and friends. <em>(Bows to the Master with folded hands and addresses him.)</em> Master, I do not know anything. I am an insignificant human being. I do not know what is best for us. We gave you our total surrender, and this is the result. My husband is here in jail suffering with you, and we are outside suffering for you. But I wish to keep my surrender unwavering. I am sure that what you have done is best for us. If this had not happened, perhaps something else infinitely worse would have happened. So I am grateful to you that only this has happened. But I do not know how to console Dayal, poor boy. He has lost both his parents. His loss is really severe.</p>
<p>DAYAL: No, no, Mother Rohini. Master, last night I had a dream. My parents came to me and told me that you had done the right thing in poisoning them. They said that they were already dead, that their inner beings had already been poisoned by their money. They had thousands of rupees but did not give you anything. Their minds were corrupted; their hearts were corrupted. They loved their money more than they loved you. So, Master, they feel that you saved them from wasting many years in ignorance and bondage. In their next incarnation, they feel that you will give them more spiritual wealth and less physical wealth so that they will be able to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the service of God. Master, they feel that you have done the right thing, and for that they are most grateful to you. And I, too, am grateful. My parents say that they are very happy in the other world, and that makes me happy, even though I still miss them. I know that they will come to me from time to time and bless me inwardly. That will be enough. Meanwhile, my aunt Rohini will be my mother now. She is all kindness, all affection, all love. I get everything I need from her. And when my uncle comes back, he will be my father. So I shall still have a father and a mother who are your disciples.</p>

<p><em>(Ratan and Master are asleep in their prison cell. An angel appears to Ratan, who wakes up and rises to his feet.)</em></p>
<p>ANGEL: Ratan, the authorities have learned of your innocence, and they will set you free tomorrow.</p>
<p>RATAN: I don’t want to be freed without my Master. He is everything to me. If he is not freed, I am not going to leave this prison. I will stay with him and serve him here. I won’t go without him.</p>
<p>ANGEL: Your Master has ruined your life. He has ruined the lives of many innocent people and caused them terrible suffering. Many people had great faith in him, and now see what he has done to them. His spiritual children dare not show their faces, for his crime has been like a slur on their lives, and they are now ridiculed and mocked. Can’t you recognise your stupidity?</p>
<p>RATAN: You call it stupidity, but I call it my oneness with my Master. This life of mine will last only for a short while. I have given it to my Master unconditionally, and I won’t take it back now. I have surrendered everything to my Master. My body, vital, mind, heart and soul are all for his use only, until I die. I never want to be separated from my Master. If he is in hell, that will be my Heaven. I shall stay with him. And if he goes to Heaven, there I too shall go. I don’t need earthly freedom, I don’t need anybody on earth except him.</p>
<p><em>(Ratan sings.)</em></p>

<p>Guruh Brahma Guruh Vishnu<br /> Guruh devo maheshwarah<br /> Gurureva param Brahma<br /> Tasmai shri gurabe namah<br /> Guru is Brahma, Guru is Vishnu,<br /> Guru is the great God Shiva.<br /> Indeed, Guru is the Brahman.<br /> To that Divine Master I offer my obeisance.</p>

<p>ANGEL: Suppose I were to give you illumination this very moment. Would you not leave your Master then, seeing that he is far inferior to you?</p>
<p>RATAN: No, even if you were to give me illumination I would not leave my Master. He taught me about God, he gave me the message of God, he inspired my love for God. If you gave me illumination, I would give it to my Master.</p>
<p>ANGEL: So you admit that your Master does not have illumination?</p>
<p>RATAN: I do not know whether my Master has it or not. But I feel that he has.</p>
<p>ANGEL: If he had illumination, how could he do such inhuman, absurd, unthinkable things? Would an illumined soul poison his own disciples in order to get their money? Those two disciples whom he poisoned have such nobility that they came to their son and told him lies in order to protect their Master’s reputation and to prevent their son from losing all faith in the spiritual life. I tell you, you yourself are far superior to your Master in spirituality. Your Master is a real fake. You are deceiving yourself and placing your faith in a fraud.</p>
<p>RATAN: I cannot judge my Master. He knows what is best for me and for all his disciples. I am sure that whatever he has done has been for the best.</p>
<p>ANGEL: I shall give you some sound advice. One who has a truly illumined Master will realise God infinitely sooner than one with a false Master. Therefore, one should use discrimination and look for a genuine Master. But because of your tremendous sincerity and devotion, I am going to give you illumination anyway.</p>
<p>RATAN: I shall look upon the illumination you give me as a fruit. If you give me a fruit, I shall share it with my Master. If you free me, I shall take my Master with me, and if he is not allowed to leave, then I also shall stay. So whatever you give to me, you are giving equally to him.</p>
<p>ANGEL: The moment I touch your head, you will be illumined. Then wake your Master if you wish and touch him. You will give him illumination.</p>
<p><em>(Angel places his hands on Ratan’s head. Master wakes up and watches his disciple receiving illumination. When the angel removes his hands from Ratan’s head, Ratan immediately prostrates himself and touches his Master’s feet. Master is illumined. Master and Ratan embrace each other, and the gate of the prison cell disappears.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Exeunt Master and Ratan)</em></p>
