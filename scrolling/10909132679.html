What happens on those days?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We feed the body twice or three times a day without fail. But when it is a matter of the soul, the Divine Child inside us, we cleverly manage to forget that we have to feed it, too, and very often we neglect it. Then what happens? When we do not feed the Divine Child within us, we cannot manifest our inner divine qualities; we cannot manifest our soul's possibilities. God is within us, everything divine is within us, but where? It is all deep inside, concealed, hidden. We have to bring it to the fore. We have to manifest it and offer it to the world. Only then is our game complete. Otherwise, we remain unfulfilled and God remains unfulfilled. The world is God's Creation. The world is our brother; the world is our sister; the world is our mother. All of us are members of God's family. So what we have, we have to share with the world, with our own family. Those who are praying, concentrating, meditating daily are feeding their souls; and when the potentialities and possibilities of the soul are manifested in the outer world, they become Reality, divine Reality. In divine Reality we see and grow into the real face of Truth, the real face of Perfection, the real face of our divine Oneness with God the Creator, with God the Creation.</p>
<p>We know that once upon a time we didn't meditate, and we were half animal. Now we are meditating and we feel that we are half human and half divine. And when our meditation approaches perfection, at that time we will be totally divine.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Sometimes when I meditate it is so beautiful, but at other times I forget how beautiful meditation is, or how good it is for me. How can I inspire myself to meditate again? It is like a road that goes into a fairyland, but sometimes I just don't find that road.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. Suppose you have started to meditate but nothing is coming. Then try to think of a particular day when you had the highest meditation, and consciously go deep into that meditation. Think of the essence of that meditation — how you were thrilled, how you were jumping with delight. That is why I always tell my disciples to keep a diary. First it will be imagination, for you are not actually having that meditation. But just enter into the world of imagination and stay there for ten or fifteen minutes. While you are there, power will automatically enter into your meditation; and this power is not imagination. The work of scientists is all based on imagination. First they have inspiration, and the next step is imagination. They dwell in their imagination for months or years, and then some power or energy enters into the imagination and it bears fruit. So this is one way. The other way is to remember how many times your Master has shown you real love and unconditional concern. Immediately gratitude will flow. When tears of gratitude flow, it is like a springboard. If you shed a few tears of gratitude, immediately the springboard within you pushes you up and you dive into the most wonderful meditation. With one of these ways you are bound to succeed.</p>

Is this a bad thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, it is not a good thing. It is not sleep; but you are not fully awakened either. When you meditate, you have to be absolutely dynamic. Do not allow sleepiness to enter into you. Feel that you are entering into the battlefield where you have to fight against ignorance, doubt, imperfection and death.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many disciples do not get enough inspiration to energise them for meditation. Some days you get inspiration all at once; other days you don't get any inspiration at all. If the fire is already burning inside, you don't have to do anything. But when there is no fire, what do you do? The best thing is to breathe in deeply a few times before you meditate and make your whole body energetic. Your dynamic energy will help you enter into meditation. Or you can jog a little. If possible, take a small quantity of hot juice or hot milk before you enter your meditation. Your whole system will be attuned with the divine energy, and this divine energy will take you to the proper place of meditation in your inner consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I get upset, I can&#039;t seem to meditate the way I want to. I seem to think more of my problems. How can I overcome this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I get upset, I can&#039;t seem to meditate the way I want to. I seem to think more of my problems. How can I overcome this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are upset, you can't meditate. It is quite natural. You cannot welcome a friend and an enemy into your house at the same time. Your enemy is your agitation, your anxiety, worry and so on. And your friend is meditation. For the time being you have allowed someone undivine to enter into you. That is why you are upset. If at that very moment you want to invite in somebody divine, why should he come when you have already welcomed somebody undivine, who is hostile to him?</p>
<p>When you are upset, first ask yourself if you are doing the right thing by becoming upset. By getting angry with somebody, can you change his nature? If somebody has done a terrible thing, can you change his nature by scolding him, by insulting him, by punishing him? Impossible! Even if somebody has done something bad to you, and you have scolded that person and he is sorry and sheds bitter tears, then you will go deep within and feel sorry that now that person is sad and miserable. When you go within, you will see that you have done many, many things worse, infinitely worse, than that person whom you have scolded and insulted has done. In that case, if you start shedding tears or feeling remorse, then you will go on entering into your past, seeing how many thousands of things you have done wrong in your life.</p>
<p>You get upset because something has gone wrong either in you or in somebody else. But you cannot meditate when you are upset, so the best thing is to try not to get upset. When somebody has done something wrong to you, try to feel either that it is an extended part of your consciousness which has made this deplorable mistake, or just feel that it is an experience you had for only a few seconds. The sooner you can rid yourself of the idea that somebody has done something to you, the better off you will be. You have had an unpleasant experience, and you will not be happy until you stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Always you have to feel that there are two ways to get out of worldly calamities. One way is to enlarge your heart. If you have been wronged, identify. Feel that it is you who have done wrong. In that way you won't become upset. How often do we curse ourselves? How often do we have the time to think of correcting and perfecting ourselves? All the time we are thinking of others. If we are sincere, we shall see that those who are victims of jealousy are always thinking of their enemies; those who are victims of fear are constantly thinking of others who are creating fear in them. In this way, all the time we think of others and not of ourselves.</p>
<p>The second way is to think of perfecting ourselves. The time comes when we become aware that we have two selves. One self is continually making us feel how weak we are, how insignificant we are, how deplorable our condition is. That self is not our true self. Then there is another self that tells us how pure we inwardly are, or how pure we can be, how sincere we can be, how humble we can be, how divine we can be. That is our true self. When we stop thinking perfecting others and only care for our own aspiration, we are not acting like a hermit who does not care for the world's transformation. No! As long as we are amidst friends, neighbours and family, our own perfection helps them. When we achieve one thing, we will see that very thing in a small measure in others. If we see something wrong in others, something undivine, tomorrow we will see that very thing in ourselves. And if we see something good in someone but not in ourselves, that particular thing will soon develop in us. If we see a person who is sincere and we are not sincere, just by consciously seeing the sincerity in someone else, our own inner sincerity will come to the fore. Our inner being will try to communicate with the sincerity of that particular person. And then, like a magnet, it will draw sincerity either from that person or from the Source from which all sincerity comes.</p>
<p>From now on please try, all of you, to perfect your own nature instead of looking around to see who is obstructing you or standing in your way. Pay all attention to your own self-discovery, and when you have discovered yourself, you will see that there is nobody imperfect on earth. Everybody is perfect in you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: During a meditation, if something external to the meditation occurs — such as a noise or something unforeseen — is it better to include it in the meditation or to try to shut it out and pursue the meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: During a meditation, if something external to the meditation occurs — such as a noise or something unforeseen — is it better to include it in the meditation or to try to shut it out and pursue the meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each seeker has to know his own standard of meditation. If we are a beginner, we should feel that anything that is not part of the meditation is like an intruder. We should not allow an intruder, a foreigner, to enter into us and disturb us. But if we are very advanced, and there is a disturbing sound or a noise during our meditation, we can go deep into the sound itself and try to assimilate it. If we have the capacity, then in our own consciousness we can transform the attack of a most powerful, most challenging foreign element into an inner music, a thrilling or haunting music, which will really add to our meditation. But we have to develop this capacity to transform a disturbing, annoying noise into soothing, thrilling and soul-stirring music. When we have this capacity we shall include the disturbance in our meditation. As long as we don't have the capacity, we shall always exclude it.</p>
<p>If we have strength, inner strength, to transform someone, when he is transformed he becomes totally ours. Before we entered into the spiritual life we had darkness, ignorance. Now we have started transforming our own darkness and ignorance. When they are finally transformed and illumined, they will still be our own possessions. But where they previously stood in our way, now, on the contrary, they shall help us. The darkness has been transformed into light, and it has become an added help.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The thing that holds you back is fear, which has no meaning at all. If you want the wealth which the ocean holds deep inside itself, you have to dive within. Fear and wealth don't go together. Only if you have inner courage can you receive the inner wealth. It is fear of the unknown and unknowable that prevents you from diving deep within. But what is unknowable today becomes merely unknown tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow it becomes known. The vastness of Truth can never destroy you. It can only embrace and fulfil you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you come to meditate after you have mixed with ordinary people, unaspiring people, how can you enter into your good, high, deep meditation? Immediately try to think of two rooms right in front of you. Feel that one room is unlit, and there — while you were in school, when you were with unaspiring people — you were caught by some dacoits or hooligans who were trying to strangle you. They were about to kill you. You were struggling with them because your whole life is a life of aspiration.</p>
<p>You were in that situation for four or five hours, and suddenly you have escaped from that world of destruction. When you come to the Centre and sit in front of me and meditate, you have to feel that you have escaped. You could have been killed by those forces; you could have been totally destroyed, annihilated. When you have that kind of feeling, great relief enters into you. When you feel with great relief that you have now entered into a room of Peace, Light, Bliss and Delight, automatically you will be able to meditate well. Automatically you will feel that here is your soul and here is your home. When you have that kind of great relief, you are automatically separated from the world of unreality, which is destruction in the spiritual life. Otherwise, when you come to meditate, these unaspiring forces will also come. You do not give them up; you still carry them in your mind. You carry their vibration, their atmosphere, their thoughts and ideas. Unconsciously they are coming. It is as though somebody has thrown a heavy load into a train. You don't know who has thrown it; you are just bringing the load. But as soon as you have the capacity to enter into the other room, just throw the heavy bags away and escape.</p>
<p>Some people take meditation as part of their schedule. They feel that one thing follows another in a continuous series: at eight o'clock they go to the office; at five o'clock they come back; at six o'clock they go to the Centre for meditation. But it is wrong to take it that way. Feel that the other events in life — when you mix with unaspiring people, ordinary people who are taking away your aspiration — are like destructive forces. So do not link up these incidents with others. On the contrary, break the incidents that are destructive from the other incidents in your life. Enter into the meditation room and feel that this is the real life and that was the unreal life. In this way you separate the real life from the unreal life. The moment you do this, you see that the real life is welcoming you with all its riches. If you do not make this conscious separation, then you are lost. If you feel that life is a continuous series of incidents, coming one after another, you are caught. Don't feel that this is an incident and that is also an incident. No! This incident is fulfilling and that incident is destructive, so you cannot tie them, you cannot unite them; you have to break them. When you break them, automatically you enter into the best, the highest meditation.</p>

<p>As an illumined Yogi of the highest order, Sri Chinmoy does not normally "lecture" about meditation. He teaches meditation in silence, through the inner contact he establishes with a seeker. From time to time, however, he has answered specific questions on meditation. Some of those questions have been collected in this present volume.</p>
