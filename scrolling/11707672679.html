<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In itself, the 27th has no special significance. Millions of cats and dogs were also born on that day. But if you identify yourself with me and my birthday, then the 27th will give you a kind of inner joy and your love, devotion and surrender to the Supreme in me may increase. Your own birth date also should make you feel happy. God wanted you to take birth on a particular date, so that particular date should make you happy.</p>

Do you have any other names?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I had so many names in the Ashram. My dearest friend, who saw something in me long before anybody else, used to call me Chinny. Someone else used to call me Chinnymoyda. 'Chinny' means sugar and 'moyda' means flour. When I was very young, some people used to call me a name that meant 'Japanese doll' because they felt I was cute. Then some people, especially girls, gave me a name meaning 'fire' because my eyes were always red, wide open and very fiery; they felt there was no compassion in my eyes. Others called me Jogisamrat, Jogibar or Jogiraj. Everybody can give names. When my disciples are pleased with me, they give me one name; when they are displeased with me, another name they give me. Every day they may give me a different name, and I am ready to accept all of these names.</p>
<p>So these are the names that I had. I also have many, many inner names, but those are not for the disciples to know. Some special souls have given me names and also some of my disciples have given me names, but that information is restricted.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If a disciple can please the Master wholeheartedly while he and the Master are on earth, then in the disciple's next incarnation he will have inner experiences or spiritual dreams right from childhood. Those who establish a very, very soulful connection with me in this lifetime will feel me inside their heart right from childhood in their next incarnation. Also, they will come into a family that will have a picture of me in the house. Millions of families keep pictures of Krishna or some other spiritual figure. In some cases, as soon as the children see a picture of that spiritual figure, they get such powerful inner feelings. Similarly, those who establish the closest connection with me while I am on earth will get joy even when they hear my name in future lifetimes. And if they see my picture, no matter which picture it is, they will get tremendous joy. Everything depends on the soul's connection established while the Master is alive. If there is no inner hunger, an individual will get almost nothing from a Master — no matter how great the Master is. Many people knew who Buddha and Krishna were when they lived on earth, but most of these people rejected their light. The Buddha had infinite Compassion, but people felt, "I don't need it. Who cares if he is inwardly the richest man? I am happy to remain a beggar in the street."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each Master has his own way. After getting a certain number of disciples, some Masters stop. In my case, I try to be of service to everyone who wants light. You can say I am greedy. No matter how many disciples I get, I say, "I am still hungry, I am still hungry." Some Masters like a small garden with just a few flowers. I like a big garden where many flowers can grow, with the hope that among them there will be a few flowers that will be most beautiful and most fragrant! That will give me so much joy!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the evening of his life, my father taught everything to my brother Chitta. Then, during the last ten or twelve years of his life, if there was any problem involving the family, my father would say, "Go to Chitta. He knows better than I do." My father had such confidence in Chitta! When you see that somebody else in your family can do your job well, it is such a relief. You get tremendous joy because you are the one who taught him.</p>
<p>I also am hoping to have disciples like that. I am not just talking about individuals who are good at manifestation. No, no! I am talking about some disciples who will have such love, devotion and unconditional surrender that they will become supremely chosen instruments of our Lord Beloved Supreme. If some disciples of mine can become really good, really perfect, you have no idea how much joy it will give me. Then, from their example others can learn; you can call it inner or outer teaching. It is not that I will be like my father and delegate my responsibilities to them. No, only I will be so happy to find disciples who will please me by serving God unconditionally in God's own Way.</p>

 <p>
SCA 324-328. Questions and answers drawn from remarks Sri Chinmoy made in the spring of 1996 to his disciples who work at the United Nations.</p>
<h2>Question: With all the unwise things being done at the United Nations, do you still feel that it can be an instrument for world peace?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In matters of world peace, for me the United Nations is still by far the best divine instrument — no matter how many unaspiring workers are there and no matter how many unwise things are being done every day by those who are in the United Nations, with the United Nations and for the United Nations — right from the highest to the lowest. If the United Nations fails completely, then I do not think any world organisation or institution will ever succeed. The dream of the United Nations, the vision of the United Nations, the reality of the United Nations came from the Highest, the Absolute Highest. For the establishment of world peace, UN the temple, UN the shrine, UN the heart and UN the soul are unparalleled. The United Nations is not a mere building; the United Nations is a reservoir of divine Light for the manifestation of world peace. Then again, it can be something else altogether if the instruments do not do the right thing and do not want to become the right persons. If the instruments are unwilling, then what can the poor Inner Pilot of the United Nations do?</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What do you expect from your disciples who are working at the United Nations?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What do you expect from your disciples who are working at the United Nations?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both the soul of the United Nations and I expect something special from my disciples who are working at the United Nations. I do not want you people to behave like ordinary workers in a factory or bank or restaurant. I do not want you to work mechanically — like a computer, in which everything is fixed, mechanical, mathematical. No, I want you people to bring to the fore your divine qualities to please the illumining soul and the aspiring heart of the United Nations.</p>
<p>I want my disciple UN workers to offer the spontaneous beauty of a flower that is blossoming and giving fragrance daily. Every morning when you arrive at your office, you should place your own heart-flower on the altar of the United Nations. How? For two minutes or even two seconds you can simply say, "O United Nations, you have the highest goal. I want to become part and parcel of this loftiest goal."</p>
<p>Each day I expect you people to identify with the loftiest vision of the United Nations — the vision which is not from the Secretaries-General or from any other high-ranking UN officials but which came into being in 1945. Working at the United Nations is like being affiliated with a great university. There are many, many universities; but if you can become a student at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cambridge or Oxford, it is a special privilege. The ideals and the vision that these special universities embody, other universities unfortunately have not embodied. We cannot say that the others are not also universities. But the height that these special universities have reached, the others have not reached. Some may say that these prestigious universities have not maintained their height, but nevertheless the world recognises these universities as top-ranking.</p>
<p>Similarly, some spiritual Masters are highly respected. In the spiritual life, there is great joy in identifying oneself with a genuine Master of the highest order. If you think of Lord Krishna, Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ or another of the world's greatest spiritual figures, you get tremendous joy. Among the living spiritual Masters, if you can identify yourselves with those who have achieved the highest height, you get tremendous satisfaction. In the same way, I am asking my disciples who work at the United Nations to identify themselves with the loftiest ideals of the United Nations and serve the United Nations as real divine instruments.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when I am working, I get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of what my boss wants of me that I forget about my spiritual life.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when I am working, I get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of what my boss wants of me that I forget about my spiritual life." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have been cultivating your own divinity for five or ten or twenty years, but now you are compromising it just to please your boss. I always say that the spiritual life is not a life of compromise. Either you accept God on His own terms or you accept the outer life on its terms; there is no in-between. You cannot be fifty per cent for God and fifty per cent for the ordinary, unaspiring world. If you try to compromise in that way, you are neither here nor there; you are finished.</p>
<p>The things that you should take pride in are the very things that you are discarding because one of your co-workers may ridicule you or your boss may not promote you. If you do not value your own spirituality, your own divinity, then there will be nobody on earth to value it. Because you are afraid of losing your outer wealth, which is not going to happen, you are not valuing your inner wealth. Your inner wealth is your real treasure, but you take it as only a grain of sand.</p>
<p>Your inner treasure you have to cherish at every moment. At every moment you have to become your heart's aspiring cry and your soul's illumining smile. At every second you have to allow your inner cry to lead you, guide you, shape you and mould you. Your heart's mounting inner cry wants to climb up to the highest height, but for the sake of outer success and outer comfort, you are destroying its upward flight. You are sacrificing and silencing your inner cry or throwing cold water on it. Your inner cry is like a ladder that will take you up, up, up; but you are not using the ladder. This is a most deplorable mistake that you will regret to the end of your life!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Some disciples seem to be afraid that their bosses and colleagues will hold it against them for following the spiritual life, and they will never get a promotion.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Some disciples seem to be afraid that their bosses and colleagues will hold it against them for following the spiritual life, and they will never get a promotion." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They will not hold it against you. On the contrary, if you are very strict with your own life, others will respect you for abiding by the truth that you have seen and felt. If you have the conviction that what you are doing, what you are saying and what you are becoming is right, then there shall come a time when others also will value you because you are doing the right thing. In fact, people who ridicule you or consider you useless eventually may see more true divinity inside you than you see inside yourself. I have seen this happen many times. If someone remains faithful to his own convictions, people who once ridiculed him develop faith in him — even more faith than he has in himself.</p>
<p>I am not telling you <em>not</em> to get a promotion. I am saying, do get a promotion — by working hard. Definitely you should please your boss, but only in the way that you are expected to please him. If you are supposed to be punctual, be punctual. If you are supposed to be attentive, be attentive. If you are supposed to concentrate on something to meet a deadline, then do it. There are so many essential things that you must do. But you must not discard your inner life to fulfil your outer life.</p>
<p>In fact, you could be infinitely more helpful to your bosses if you manifested your own divinity. Each of my disciples possesses and embodies many divine qualities that come from the Supreme. With these qualities He is hoping to manifest Himself in and through you. You have to be extremely, extremely grateful to Him for these qualities and use them in a divine way. If you can bring these qualities into your work, if you can offer your divinity through your work, then you will be able to help and please your colleagues and bosses infinitely more than you are helping and pleasing them now. Then, instead of being a good worker in their eyes, you will be a super-super-excellent worker.</p>
<p>Right now you are only giving them your cleverness, but your divine qualities you are not giving because you feel that you will be misunderstood. You feel others will regard your divine qualities as craziness or stupidity and take them as a joke. But if you let your colleagues and bosses see your divinity, it will immediately penetrate their hearts. If they see light in you while you are touching a piece of paper or talking to them, if they see a beautiful flower on your face and beautiful luminosity in your eyes and movements, these qualities will enter into their hearts.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you cannot remain in my divine consciousness or even think of me, how are you going to offer my light to others? If you remain in my consciousness and receive the inner food that your soul is eagerly trying to give you, then you will be in a position to share it. But if you are not receiving my light at all, if you are not even hungry for light, then how are you going to distribute it? Some people who say they want to give light are themselves not thirsty for light. It is only when you become a dynamo of my light that you can hope to offer my light to others.</p>
<p>If you make real progress in your spiritual life, then the light and the other divine qualities that you are getting from your inner life you will give to your colleagues and bosses spontaneously. Naturally you will manifest your own height — not showing off, but just spontaneously expressing it. If you remain in a garden or a flower shop for a few hours, the beauty and fragrance of the flowers will enter into your consciousness and remain inside you. Then, when you go out, the people you encounter will see you as a most beautiful flower. At that time they will see such inner fragrance in your eyes, in your face, in your smile!</p>

 <p>
SCA 329-332. Four questions asked at Aspiration Ground by some of Sri Chinmoy's younger disciples who were visiting New York from abroad in early September 1994.</p>
<h2>Question: When I am in New York and near you physically, I feel that your grace and protection is stronger than when I am home in England. Is this just my imagination, or is it really true?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your love and oneness with me. The Supreme's Protection inside me is omnipresent. But when you are here and you can see me with your physical eyes, you feel it more; that is the advantage of being in my physical proximity. Actually, this Protection is everywhere. So if you see me as a God-realised person, then you will feel that no matter which part of the world you are in, the Supreme in me will protect you with utmost compassion and affection because of your prayerful, soulful life.</p>
<p>If you have the right attitude towards your Master's physical presence, then you can get the utmost benefit. Otherwise, the mind can be tricky. You will see me limping and immediately your doubting mind will say, "Oh, he cannot even walk, so how is he going to protect me!" But if your aspiring heart comes forward, it will say, "Even if my Guru cannot walk for some inner or outer reason, I know that he is one with the Supreme and I have utmost faith in him."</p>
<p>The advantage of coming to see me in New York is that it helps you to renew your inspiration and aspiration. Undoubtedly, the two weeks that you come here for our April and August celebrations are like a refueling. Many people come with practically no inspiration, but they go back with new inspiration and new aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: A week before I come to New York I feel that my consciousness always falls.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: A week before I come to New York I feel that my consciousness always falls." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is your way of thinking. I am not flattering you, but when you come here, I see that your aspiration is quite high — right from the very first day. I do not want others to be jealous of you, but when I see you in New York I am very pleased, very pleased!</p>
<p>Before you come to New York, if you have problems with your consciousness, just try to imagine as often as possible, during the day and at night, that you actually are here with us in New York. Only think of Aspiration-Ground and of your Guru; dream of everything in New York that inspires you. Physically you are still in your country, but inwardly and spiritually you will already be in New York. If you do this, it will solve your problem.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I overcome my impurity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I overcome my impurity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Purity is already inside your heart — inside everybody's heart. The mind is the thing that lacks purity. So you have to exercise your imagination. Imagination has a reality of its own. Imagine that your mind is a most beautiful flower. All right, you may not know what the mind is. But you know your head; it is a solid object. So imagine that your head is a most beautiful flower — whatever flower you like most, which gives you utmost joy. Imagine that you do not have a nose, or ears, or eyes; only feel that your entire head is a most beautiful flower that is full of fragrance.</p>
<p>Then look at your flower-face in the mirror. While looking lovingly at the flower for a few seconds, you cannot have undivine thoughts. When the beauty and fragrance of the flower are entering into your mind, you cannot think of undivine things. So always think of a flower. There are other ways also to get purity, but this is the easiest way.</p>
<p>Impurity does not originate inside you; it is coming from outside — from the undivine consciousness of the outer world. It starts with the breath, when you inhale. Our impurity does not start below the navel; it starts in the nose, when we breathe in, and then it goes downward. So when you breathe in, you have to feel that it is the flower that is breathing in; you have to feel that the beauty and fragrance of the flower are receiving everything that is coming inside you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes I am afraid of meditation. Why is this?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes I am afraid of meditation. Why is this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fear comes from a sense of separativity; you are afraid of someone or something only because you have not established your oneness. To the little child, his father is a giant; but he is not afraid because he is all love and all affection for his father. He is not afraid to grab his father, for he knows that his father is not going to slap him.</p>
<p>You have to take meditation as your dearest friend, who is taking you to God. Prayer is your friend and meditation is your friend. These friends will do only the right thing for you. They will take you to your Highest. Meditation is not something to be afraid of; it is something to love, cherish and treasure. So if you think about meditation in a positive way, if you take it as somebody who is full of affection, love and concern for you, then you cannot be afraid of it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part IV</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part IV" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
SCA 333-339. General questions.</p>
<h2>Question: Is it all right for disciples to write soulful songs, or are your songs all we need?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do not have to worry about writing devotional songs or poems to express your feelings or to increase your devotion; I have written more than enough on your behalf. So many times in my songs and poems I have identified with the disciples — with your thoughts and feelings. In a particular poem when I am saying how helpless and useless I am, at that time I am not in a low consciousness. No, no, no! Then again, when I am imploring God for forgiveness, I am being absolutely sincere because at that time I have identified myself completely with this person or that person.</p>
<p>Over the years I have written so many poems and songs about the heart's love, devotion and surrender, about forgiveness and gratitude, in order to offer the world inspiration and aspiration. If you can identify yourself with my songs, my writings, my aspiration and my realisation, then they will all become yours. Again, if you want to write songs, it is fine with me. If you feel it will increase your aspiration, then definitely do it. But if you do not have the capacity to compose, do not feel miserable. It is not at all necessary for your spiritual progress, since you can get the same inspiration and aspiration by identifying yourself with the writer and composer in me.</p>
<p>Although God is infinite, immortal and eternal, because of my love for Him I can claim Him as my own, very own. Similarly, when you sing one of my songs most soulfully, if you can feel that this particular song has become part and parcel of your life, if you can feel that each breath of yours is inside that song, then how can you not claim that song as your own? I will never say, "You are stealing the life-breath from my song." On the contrary, I will be so happy if you can claim my songs as your own.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Peace Concert, I brought down solid light, solid peace, solid bliss. While I was meditating, I was absolutely trembling with these divine realities. If somebody receives an iota of this wealth, then I am the happiest person. The Creator is not Sri Chinmoy but the Supreme in me. So if He shares His inspiration, aspiration and realisation with me, then why should I not share these with you? It is like sharing a mango. If I can share my mango with you, then I get added joy. The Supreme gave me some most delicious mangoes and asked me to share them with the rest of the world. Again, although it was the Supreme who gave me these things, I claim them as my own. Because of my feeling of oneness with Him, I do not feel that I got these divine realities from a third person.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters advise their students to express their creativity. They say, "If you create something, then you will learn something about the creative process and be more satisfied." The theory is that if you achieve something through the sweat of your brow, then you will appreciate it more. If you have to earn your own money, you will realise how difficult it is and you will be wiser in the way you spend it. But there is also another theory: If your father gives you inner wealth, then from your spiritual life — from your meditation and aspiration — you can also get the wisdom to use it properly.</p>
