  <h2 id="page-title">God will take care of us</h2><span property="dc:title" content="God will take care of us" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a very spiritual man who was also extremely interested in reading. He used to read voraciously. He had a wife and two sons. Since he did not work at a regular job, it was difficult for him to meet with the expenses of his family. He had only a small plot of land, which his sons used to plough and grow rice on. This was their main source of income.</p>
<p>The spiritual seeker used to buy books like anything. His wife was dead against it. She would say to him, "You buy books, and we can't even eat properly."</p>
<p>On one particular day he bought a book for twenty rupees. His wife was furious. "Now we won't be able to eat for two days!"</p>
<p>Her husband said, "No, God will take care of us. Since he has given us mouths, he will bring us food also."</p>
<p>His wife was very skeptical. "This is your spirituality! You read and you talk."</p>
<p>On the following day the seeker received a registered letter. He opened it to find that somebody had sent him forty rupees. The letter said, "Here are forty rupees. Last night I had a dream. I don't know who you are, but in my dream a most luminous person came and told me to send you forty rupees. The luminous being gave me your name and address and said that you were close to him. Since you are very spiritual, he wanted me to send you this money right away. I am sending it registered, in case my dream was not true."</p>
<p>The seeker accepted the letter and his son said, "See, my father is right."</p>
<p>"Your father is right?" said the wife. "It is my worries which made everything all right."</p>
<p>The husband said, "At least there should be something to keep everything all right. It may be your worries, or my prayers, or God's Compassion for us, or my children's luck. But as for me, I feel I know who is responsible and who alone will always be responsible, and that is my Beloved Lord."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The unconditional gift</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The unconditional gift" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once a spiritual Master was enjoying his morning walk. It was a very, very cold winter day. One of his disciples came running up to him and gave him an expensive, beautiful shawl. Then he went back inside and left the Master. The Master was walking in a meditative mood when he saw a poor old man near him. The old man was also in a meditative mood, so the Master asked him, "Can I interrupt you?"</p>
<p>The spiritual man said, "Yes, certainly, you can. You are a spiritual Master. You have every right to speak to me. How I wish to become as great as you are."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am a spiritual Master," he replied, "but I have a little more money-power than you do. How I wish you would take this shawl from me."</p>
<p>"I need only God," the old man said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Master, "but God is speaking through me. If you have this shawl, you will be able to meditate better."</p>
<p>"Is it so?" asked the man.</p>
<p>"Yes," the Master said, "if you don't suffer from cold so much, you will be able to meditate better. I have finished my meditation and I am going home. Please take this shawl."</p>
<p>The poor man finally accepted the shawl and thanked the spiritual Master. He continued praying and meditating.</p>
<p>When the Master returned home, the disciple asked, "Where is the shawl? Such an expensive, beautiful shawl I gave to you!"</p>
<p>The Master said, "Make up your mind. Did you give it to me to carry for you or to have as my own?"</p>
<p>The disciple said, "I gave it to you to have as your own."</p>
<p>"Then, if you give me something as a gift," said the Master, "how do you dare to ask me for it?"</p>
<p>"I am not asking for it for myself," said the disciple, "but for you, so the next time you go out you will be able to use it."</p>
<p>"Did you give me this to please me or to please yourself? If it was to please yourself, I have the money. I am sending someone to get a more expensive, beautiful shawl and I will give it to you. But if you did it just to please me, for my sake, then keep silent."</p>
<p>The disciple got the point. " I gave it to please you, Master."</p>
<p>The Master blessed the disciple. "Whenever you give something to the Master, you can't ask the Master to use it in your own way. He will always use it in his own way. That is the right way."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gandhi&#039;s tie</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gandhi&#039;s tie" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Gandhi was once working as a lawyer in South Africa. He wanted to be economical, since everything was very expensive there. Since the washermen used to charge very high amounts, Gandhi thought of washing his clothes himself. He read a few books about how to wash clothes properly, how to iron and so forth.</p>
<p>One day, while he was washing his clothes, he used too much starch on a particular tie. Then he did not press it properly. That day, when he went to court, his friends noticed something funny about his tie and began laughing.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" they asked. "Why is starch falling from your tie?"</p>
<p>Gandhi said, "You are making fun of me. I am giving you joy. It is not an easy task to give people joy. Right now I am learning to wash clothes. I badly want to save money and washermen are charging very high prices. Soon I will become an expert, but now I am giving you joy, so I am very happy. It is a difficult thing to give others joy, but I am doing it. Therefore, I am proud of myself."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Gandhi&#039;s self-sufficiency</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Gandhi&#039;s self-sufficiency" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day Gandhi went to an English barber to have his hair cut. But the barber said to him, "You black man, I won't cut your hair! Go away."</p>
<p>Gandhi was unhappy, but he was, as always, forgiving. So he said, "He is right. If he cuts my hair, who knows what will happen. We are all the time fighting against the British. They feel we are inferior people. Perhaps his boss will fire him if he cuts my hair. After all, our barbers will not cut the hair of someone of a low caste. According to the British, we are inferior. That's why the British barber is not cutting my hair. What can I do? I shall not go to another barber for more insults."</p>
<p>So Gandhi cut his own hair. He stood in front of a mirror and started with the front The front came out well, but the back was not so good.</p>
<p>The next day, when Gandhi came to court, everybody laughed and laughed. "Why didn't you go to a barber?" they asked.</p>
<p>"One barber has already insulted me," Gandhi said. "He is absolutely right. Why should he cut my hair? All right, make fun of me. One day I will learn to cut hair and wash things also. I want to be self-sufficient. When I am self-sufficient, I will be really happy. I am sure you are happy now because you are making fun of me and I am happy that I can give you joy. But a day will come when you will be proud of me. I will learn how to cut hair by myself. I want to be self-sufficient in all ways. Today my incapacity is making you happy. Some day my capacity will make you happy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Greed pays the penalty</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Greed pays the penalty" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was once a seeker living in an ashram who developed leprosy. Nobody with that kind of disease was allowed to remain in the ashram, so the head of the ashram asked him to leave. His wife and children were allowed to stay, but he was told that he had to leave. Poor fellow, what could he do?</p>
<p>So he bought a ticket and got on the train which would take him back to his home town. In the compartment he was sitting in there happened to be a few other passengers and also a huge trunk which was locked very tightly.</p>
<p>All the other passengers got off the train at their respective stops, but nobody took the trunk. This man was the only person left in the compartment, and still the trunk remained. Since he was all alone, a brilliant idea struck his mind. "Since nobody has claimed that box, let me take it home. Perhaps there will be something precious inside."</p>
<p>He could not carry the box, so he asked the taxi driver to help him take the box home. His house was empty, since his wife was in the ashram with his children. He was very excited and curious and he broke open the locks. When he opened the box he practically fainted. Inside was a dead body which was cut into four or five pieces. To see a dead body is bad enough. But what could he do with a dead body in his house? How could he bury it or cremate it all by himself? And if he asked anybody to help him, he would be arrested.</p>
<p>He decided to ask some of his relatives, but his relatives were frightened to death, and they refused to help him dispose of the body. "This is what you learn at the ashram — to steal somebody else's possession? Now you pay the penalty," they said, and they would not help him.</p>
<p>The man locked the box again and hired two strong men to take it to a nearby river. But the two men wanted to know what was inside. He said, "Just some rubbish, which I don't want to keep. These are all my wife's belongings. I want to get rid of them. She was so evil." Then he made up a story about how bad his wife was.</p>
<p>The two strong men were about to throw the box into the river when, O God, a policeman happened to pass by. The man told the same story about his wife, but the policeman was curious or perhaps he was just tempted to get the things which were in the box. So he ordered the man to open it. As a result, this man who had been in the ashram was arrested and put in jail. Even today, still he has not been released. So, for his greed he is paying the penalty!</p>
<p>This kind of story is instructive. If you have greed, you pay the penalty. And if you are not cautious, also you pay the penalty.</p>
