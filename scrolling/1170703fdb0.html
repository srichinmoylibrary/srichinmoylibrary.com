<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Evolution requires human incarnation, and they do not take human incarnation. Mythology tells stories about how one god cursed another so that he would be born into a servant-class family; but these are just stories. Actually, cosmic gods do not take human incarnation because they are not evolutionary beings. They started meditating thousands of years ago and got tremendous spiritual or occult power and enormous light, and this satisfied them. They reached a certain height, which is infinitely superior to the height of ordinary human beings. But they will not go any higher.</p>
<p>According to our present standard, the cosmic gods seem unlimited. We have one dollar, let us say, and the cosmic gods have ten million dollars. But ten million is not the ultimate. After ten million comes one billion and so on. We feel that the cosmic gods are dealing with the Unlimited, but that is not the case. For that, it is necessary to take a physical body and evolve from the animal to the human to the divine and, finally, to the Supreme.</p>
<p>Compared to the cosmic gods, right now human beings are like little children. A child is so small; who can ever imagine that one day he will be six feet tall? But although right now we are weaker than the weakest, our evolution never stops because human beings have the eternal hunger, the eternal aspiration, to go up, up, up. By praying and meditating and surrendering our will to God's Will, we human beings can eventually become saints, then yogis, and go beyond the cosmic gods.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are the cosmic gods still cursing each other and fighting with one another as they did in the Puranas?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are the cosmic gods still cursing each other and fighting with one another as they did in the Puranas?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In that era, 3,000 or 5,000 years ago, evolution was at that level. Sometimes the cosmic gods, knowing well God's Will, did not listen to the highest Absolute, and they created disharmony amongst themselves. They were not willing to surrender to anyone — not even to the Supreme. But the spiritual Masters have taught us to surrender to the Will of God. Jesus Christ taught us, "Let Thy Will be done." So here is the proof that we have improved.</p>
<p>Also, we have to know that in those days the world was at a particular level of consciousness, and at every moment the cosmic gods had to deal with the imperfect nature of reality. Sometimes they showed their compassion aspect or forgiveness aspect, but most of the time they showed their power aspect. They used the power aspect of God right and left to exercise their supremacy — to conquer others and rule human life. They did not care for God the creation; they were ready to destroy it in the twinkling of an eye. But with power we cannot conquer anyone permanently; we can conquer someone for only five seconds or five days. It is only if we conquer someone with love that our victory lasts forever. Similarly, the joy that comes from supremacy is no joy at all, whereas the joy that comes from oneness, which is based on love, is true joy.</p>
<p>When America dropped the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan surrendered. But did America conquer the heart of Japan? Did the Japanese love or respect America for having destroyed their country? No! By dropping a bomb on your head I can silence you for a few years. At that time I feel I am the happiest person. But eventually I realise that there are many people who are speaking ill of me, and I cannot get any joy. Everybody wants admiration from other people. If I am killing you, are you going to love and admire me? No! But if I come and embrace you with both arms wide open, then naturally you want to be my friend.</p>
<p>Many things they put in the Puranas only to make the stories more juicy. Then, when we read these things, we say, "Oh, the cosmic gods are also like us." Otherwise, who is going to pray for thousands of years for milk or for beauty? But the cosmic gods were ready to pray for thousands of years for whatever they wanted, including someone's death. Again, the thousand years they spoke of was not really a thousand; sometimes it was only one year. But even for one year will we pray for anything — even if it is our greatest desire? If we do not get what we want overnight, we say, "Oh, it is not meant for me." After two weeks or two months we say, "Since there is no hope, let me give up." But they continued. Even the demons or <em>asuras</em> did not give up so easily. They wanted to throw the gods out of Heaven, so they prayed and meditated in a most austere way for years and years. They said, "Unless and until we have arrived at our goal, we are not going to stop." These stories teach us that nothing can be gained easily; they teach us the necessity of patience and perseverance. No matter what kind of desire or aspiration we have, these stories are teaching us not to give up until we have achieved our goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In one of your poems you say that God will do everything for us if our every breath embodies soulful gratitude. This kind of gratitude seems far beyond our reach. How can we have it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In one of your poems you say that God will do everything for us if our every breath embodies soulful gratitude. This kind of gratitude seems far beyond our reach. How can we have it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Gratitude is not found in dryness or in strictness; it is not found in a morbid life. Gratitude comes from sweetness — sweetness in life, sweetness in breath. The sweetness of our own nature, our own character, our own movements will create everlasting gratitude. Gratitude is nothing but a spontaneous feeling of sweetness, which does not even have to be expressed in words. A child may not say "Thank you" to his mother, but the sweetness of his entire being is expressed through his eyes in the form of a smile. He does not know the word 'gratitude', but when the mother sees his sweet smile, she knows that the child is full of gratitude. So the more we can create sweetness in our hearts and in our being, the easier it becomes to offer gratitude to God.</p>
<p>One way to get sweetness is to look at a most beautiful, fragrant flower. When we look at the flower and smell its fragrance, consciously or unconsciously we become one with its beauty and fragrance. At that time, its sweetness enters into us or our own sweetness comes forward; sometimes both happen simultaneously. Then our whole being becomes sweet and it is easier to have good thoughts. If we are really focusing all our attention on the innocent beauty and fragrance of God the creation through this flower, then impure thoughts — which include not only lower vital thoughts but also jealousy and meanness — disappear, and only sweet thoughts remain. And when sweetness comes to the fore in our nature, it becomes very easy to offer gratitude.</p>
<p>Another way to have gratitude is to think of what we would have become if God had not shown us the light. Then we would have been somebody else — lower than the lowest. But rather than take a negative approach, we can take the positive approach and say, "O God, I am so grateful and I shall eternally remain grateful to You because You have shown me Your Light and You are allowing me to remain in Your Light."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we be sweeter?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we be sweeter?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Simplicity is the direct way of bringing sweetness into our life. Pure people can sometimes be very nicely arrogant. Indian saints are pure, but if you try to take a flower from their garden, they will come and break your head because they care only for justice! But if you only want to lead a simple life, then when a thief comes to steal your blanket, you will go running to give him your pillow also. You will tell the thief, "You like these things more than I do, so you keep them. I am satisfied only to look at the moon at night." In this way you are making your life simpler and simpler and depending only on Mother Nature. In this kind of simple life, sweetness grows.</p>
