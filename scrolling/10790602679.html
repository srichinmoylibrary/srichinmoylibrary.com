<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is your physical weakness. You must drink more juice, more milk; you are physically not strong. If the house is not in good condition, then the inhabitant cannot stay there. The inhabitant is the soul. Your soul is praying inside you. If your body is not strong, then how will you have good meditation? If the house is not in good condition, inside the house the inhabitant will not feel well. The inmate will always feel uneasy, upset, sick. So here also, in your case, please make the body strong.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do live in the heart. But everybody who is aspiring at times finds it difficult to remain in the heart all the time. If everybody were all the time in the heart, then everything would become perfect. Now, why is it that you do not always live in the heart? Sometimes you are mixing with people who are of the mental type. When you are dealing with customers, colleagues, acquaintances, they may not be at all spiritual. At that time you are assailed by their thoughts, their ideas. They live on the mental plane, so naturally they come and attack you on the mental plane and there you are engaged. You are not able to remain inside your heart. Actually, you are remaining in the heart, but you are not always conscious of your presence inside the heart. So the more you can become conscious of your presence inside the heart, the more you can be conscious of your heart-consciousness, the sooner the mind will surrender to your heart. If you are conscious of your consciousness that is inside the heart, then your mind will have to surrender to your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As we sow, so we reap. This is true. But at the same time, if you pray to God, if you meditate on God, then God’s Compassion can nullify your mistakes. When you pray and meditate, your prayer-power and meditation-power can nullify the wrong forces that come from your bad thoughts. So it is true that if you do something wrong, if you touch fire, naturally the fire will burn your fingers. But at the same time, there will be some protective power to prevent you from touching the fire.</p>
<p>If a child goes and strikes another child, he knows that this child will come and strike him back. So what will he do? He will immediately go to his father. The father is stronger and he protects the child. In this case, the Father is the Supreme. If you mix with ignorance and then ignorance wants to devour you, if you run to the Father before ignorance can devour you, the Father will show His utmost Compassion and save you from ignorance. It all depends on how much Compassion you can receive from the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have made enough progress, you will be able to know it just by the fact that at every moment you have some inner joy. Also, you will not be disturbed by the result of your actions. Suppose you engage in a particular undertaking, an action, and from this you want to have satisfactory results. If you have not made enough progress, then you will feel miserable if the result is a failure. But if the result is a failure, and still you remain cheerful, you will know that you have made tremendous progress. You have given most importance to the action, divinely done, but not to the result thereof. If the result creates problems for you, if failure disturbs you, then you have not made real progress. But if you have made real progress, true progress, then the result will never bother you. If it is good, if it is success, well and good. If it is failure, it will not bother you at all; there will be always a sweet, sweet feeling of satisfaction inside your heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is our progress slower if we miss you when you go away?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is our progress slower if we miss you when you go away?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This question can be dealt with in various ways. If you miss someone, then naturally you will try to bring that person into your consciousness. You miss me, so you try to invoke my presence. You miss the Supreme, so you invoke the Presence of the Supreme. You are a sincere seeker, so definitely you miss the Supreme. You have become a sincere seeker just because you miss the Supreme.</p>
<p>When you miss God, you feel that He is very far away, in Heaven. Since you are not seeing Him, you feel He is somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else. So naturally you miss Him. But your prayer and your meditation will one day tell you that he is everywhere, everywhere. Then you say, “If He is everywhere, why am I not seeing Him? That means my prayer can be stronger. My prayer, my meditation is sincere, but it can be stronger. Now it is strong, tomorrow it can be stronger, the day after tomorrow it can be strongest. So when my prayer and meditation become strong, stronger, strongest, at that time I will be able to see God.” It is like your two little children. Now they are studying and they are doing well. But even if they try hard, they won’t get their Master’s degree for twenty or twenty-five years. Here also, you have to pray and meditate most soulfully for many years before you can see God.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I see something beautiful, why do I feel sad?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I see something beautiful, why do I feel sad?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two reasons. One reason is that the vital comes forward and becomes jealous of the thing. Since you are not as beautiful as the other person or thing, naturally you become jealous and this jealousy is expressed as sadness. There is another reason, a spiritual reason why you become sad when you see something beautiful. Your own inner cry, your heart’s inner cry to become really beautiful, becomes one with the beauty of that particular thing. At that time, the sadness that you feel is not really sadness; it is not vital sadness. It is psychic sadness, which is the purest oneness. Psychic sadness for God, for Truth, for Light is extremely good. So if you are in a spiritual consciousness and you feel sad, that means your inner cry wants to establish its oneness with the beauty you are seeing. But if you are in a lower consciousness, a vital consciousness, then it is jealousy that is expressing itself as sadness inside you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> During meditation, please try to feel that you are not the body, not the mind, but the soul. By all the time thinking of the mind, you are having problems. The mind is not listening to you. If you constantly are thinking of the mind, then you will never get rid of the mind; it will never leave you. But if you think of something that is not the mind, something that does not require the mind and, at the same time, has infinitely more illumining capacity than the mind, you will be able to go beyond the mind. And what is this thing that is infinitely higher and more powerful than the mind? It is the soul. So when you pray and meditate, please feel that you are not the body, you are not the mind, but you are the soul, which embodies boundless light. During your meditation, please try to consciously invoke the soul or feel that you have become the soul. Do not pay any attention to the mind, but pay all attention to the soul, which you eternally are.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I write stories for you, why do I shake?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I write stories for you, why do I shake?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you write stories, your physical mind feels reverential awe. You feel, “Guru is so great, so vast; how am I going to write about him? No matter what I write, it will not be adequate.” But this is all in the physical mind. When you become one with me on the strength of your heart’s aspiration and love, on the strength of your devotion and surrender, at that time you feel an inner thrill, inner joy, inner ecstasy when you are writing about me. So if you offer love, devotion and surrender the moment you start writing, it is inner ecstasy that you enjoy. But when inner ecstasy inundates your entire being, sometimes it is beyond the capacity of the physical frame to assimilate it. You can’t store it; therefore you shake with this inner ecstasy. That is a very good experience.</p>
<p>When you are not in a higher consciousness while you are writing, at that time your mind will know my height and my depth; so a sort of reverential awe comes about. But what you experience when you are in a soulful consciousness is divine ecstasy, and that expresses itself in the physical and makes the entire body shake.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This twisted feeling is nothing but an opening of the heart centre. Now the heart centre may take a few months or a few years or many, many years to open, but when you feel a kind of twisted feeling, a twinge, it signifies the inner opening of the heart centre. What causes the feeling? It is your inner aspiration. When you have intense aspiration, you will get that type of feeling inside the heart. It is very good. But this feeling that you get is not in the physical heart; it is inside the spiritual heart. So when you feel that kind of twisted feeling, it is a sign of tremendous progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to our traditional Indian mythology, there were ten manifestations of Vishnu. In the animal kingdom, the bull was one of the manifestations. The bull was the animal in which Lord Vishnu expressed His divinity. But this is just according to tradition. From my own inner experience, I wish to say that it was the lion that entered first into the human field. The lion represents divine Victory; it was the divine force that acted in and through the lion to bring the animal consciousness into the human consciousness. It was a great victory for the animal kingdom to come out into the human kingdom; and it was a great victory for the human kingdom to get a creature from the animal kingdom to come and join the human life.</p>
<p>The divine force which is embodied in a dynamic and most powerful way is visible inside the lion. Even now, when the lion roars, it expresses divinity, power and the dynamism to conquer ignorance. How can ignorance be conquered? Ignorance can be conquered only by going beyond ignorance, by going beyond the limits where you are right now. The lion had to transcend the limits of the animal consciousness by means of some higher form, and that higher power was the divine Grace. Divine Grace entered into the lion and brought it into the human kingdom.</p>
<p>So from my own spiritual experience, I wish to say that the lion was the first animal to enter into the human kingdom. But according to our Indian mythology, it was the bull, through Lord Vishnu.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can spread your love to people provided you can see all the time your Beloved inside them. Your Beloved is the Supreme. If you see the Supreme inside them, then you will do everything for them. If you see beauty inside something, then you will touch it. If you don’t see beauty, if you see darkness and ugliness, you won’t touch it. So if you see God’s Presence inside humanity, then only will you love humanity. You have to see something divine: then only will you love. If you can see the Beloved Supreme inside each and every human being, then automatically you will have love and respect for humanity.</p>
<p>It is like a flower. You care for a flower because the flower has fragrance and beauty. But if there is no beauty, no fragrance, then you don’t like the flower. Similarly, God is there inside human beings. God is the fragrance and beauty. So if you like the fragrance and beauty, then naturally you will like the flower, humanity.</p>
<p>God the Love is inside everything that we see. If we love God, and we do love Him because He is all Love, then whatever He has created, we also love. He is bound to be in His creation just because He is everywhere, just because He is omnipresent. So if you can love God the Love, then automatically you increase your love for everything. God the Love embraces everything and is inside everything. So if you care for the Source, the Creator, then automatically you care for the creation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Indifference is not the right thing. We should not be indifferent to anything. We shall give due value to everything and everyone according to God’s inner Will within us. The real problem is not indifference but lack of aspiration. How can you give more value to aspiration? You can give more value to aspiration only by knowing what aspiration can give to you. Always try to see the goal inside. You see a fruit. You know that if you eat the fruit, then only you are satisfied. So try to feel that aspiration is a fruit, but it will give you satisfaction only if you eat it. You have to aspire every day, every day. Then, the result you get is realisation.</p>
<p>So you will be able to give all value to aspiration when you know that aspiration will give you realisation, aspiration will give you supreme satisfaction. If you know the ultimate result of what you are doing, you will not lack aspiration. You lose aspiration because you do not remember all the time what aspiration can do for you. People pray for two days, two months, two years, and then they totally forget the goal. But this is not enough. You have to pray for twenty years. When you use a stove, you have to turn the handle to a particular point before the fire comes on. But if you just start turning it and do not continue, then there will be no fire at all. So here also, your aspiration has to come to a particular point; then only will it give you realisation.</p>
<p>Aspiration becomes monotonous after a few years. Instead of climbing up the tree, people descend. So what you have to do is feel what aspiration will bring you. If you look at the thing that is after aspiration, which is realisation, then naturally you will want to fully prepare yourself, energise yourself, inundate yourself with aspiration. So always look one step ahead; look one step ahead to realisation. Then you will not be wanting in aspiration. You will be flooded with aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can see your Master always as the diamond of your heart just by aiming at constant, conscious, unconditional surrender to his will. There should be no individual will of yours, no personal will of yours. Him to please in his own way, at every moment, at every moment, should be your goal. When you do everything unconditionally, in his own way, constantly, unreservedly, cheerfully, then you can get the Master always as the diamond of your heart. On the strength of your constant surrender and constant willingness to please the Master in his own way, you will get the Master as the diamond of your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, not only godparents, but anybody can enhance the spirituality of somebody else by prayer and meditation. And if they are godparents, it means they have already taken some responsibility for their godchildren. So naturally their prayer is bound to be fulfilled, provided they are sincere in their prayer. When somebody is already connected to someone, and he is anxious to be of service to that other person, naturally the connection will enhance his ability to serve. You will always try to give more light to the persons you love. Since godparents definitely love their godchildren, their own spiritual practice, without fail, will enhance the spirituality of their godchildren. It is not only possible, but inevitable.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: While travelling, I cannot meditate regularly. How important is that for me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: While travelling, I cannot meditate regularly. How important is that for me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While travelling, you can meditate regularly if you want to. Spirituality, meditation, is as important as your life-breath. You know that if you do not breathe in, you will die. Similarly, in the spiritual world, in the soul’s world, if you don’t meditate, then you become a dead soul.</p>
<p>You can’t live on earth with yesterday’s food. Just because you ate yesterday, you can’t say that you won’t need to eat today. No. Yesterday you ate, so you are nourished; and today you have to eat again. Regularity is of paramount importance. If you are regular in everything, if you consciously meditate every day, then you will be able to make fast progress. But if there is no conscious effort, then you cannot make fast progress. So, while you are travelling, you have to make it a point to meditate regularly. Without regularity, you cannot achieve anything abiding. Before you enter into the plane, easily you can meditate for five minutes. If you have to go to the airport at a particular time, then before you leave, meditate at home for half an hour. Or if you go to the airport earlier, meditate there. Or when you enter the plane, before the other passengers come you can meditate. Where there is a will, there is a way. This is absolutely true. So please do it.</p>
