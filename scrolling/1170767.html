<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not like going to a new country; it is like returning to our original country, our own home. It is like returning to our Source. If it is reluctant surrender, we do not reach the Source; we get lost before we reach our home. If it is cheerful surrender, we go to our Source, which is all Delight, and stay there for some time. It is like entering into a flower shop — immediately we are inundated with the fragrance of flowers. If we enter into a place that has ecstasy and light, then definitely we will be inundated with these qualities.</p>
<p>Again, the intensity or profundity of joy we get from cheerful surrender is not the same as what we get when we make unconditional surrender. Unconditional surrender, even if it lasts one minute, brings the sweetest joy. I am not talking about the thought of surrender but about the act of surrender. If we make unconditional surrender in a particular action, for days afterwards we will feel so proud of that surrender. If we make unconditional surrender for a few minutes at a time for several days or months — even if it is not done every single day or all at a stretch — it will be an achievement that we can treasure for the rest of our life. As soon as we think of it, we will be the happiest and proudest person.</p>
<p>Each and every disciple of mine has made unconditional surrender to God's Will for a few minutes or for an hour at least once in this lifetime. But I doubt that any of you have done it for a whole day. It is impossible for you right now; after two hours or so something goes wrong.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Take all the members of the audience as one person, and feel that this person is yourself. If you see many people watching you, naturally you become nervous. You feel that they are judging you or criticising you. But if you take all of them as yourself, then you will not be nervous. When you are singing by yourself, even if you sing incorrectly, you do not become nervous because there is nobody to hear it. You are the singer, and you are also the audience. So when you are singing in public, take the whole audience as one individual, and then see that individual as none other than yourself. At that time, nervousness goes away.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are really singing soulfully, at that time you are in tune with your own deeper reality. When you are in tune with your own highest reality, nothing can affect you because you are divinely enamoured of your own voice; you are enjoying its fragrance and beauty. At that time, even if the person right beside you is singing incorrectly, it will not affect you.</p>
<p>But if you are in a normal consciousness, you will definitely be affected if somebody is off key. So just make your consciousness and aspiration infinitely higher and deeper. Then you will not suffer from others' incapacity or incompetence. That is the secret and sacred way to rise above the poor capacities of the other deplorable singers.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Some of your songs are quite long. Is there a trick to learning them?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Some of your songs are quite long. Is there a trick to learning them?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many ways to learn a long song — not just one way. Take, for example, my longest song, <em>Dyulok chariye.</em> One way is not to do it page by page, not to attempt to learn each verse or stanza in order. Instead you can break the mind by learning one page here and another page there. Then it becomes easier. Start, for example, by learning the first two pages and then learn the last two pages. In this way you can make your mind feel that you have started the journey and also that you have completed the journey. Another thing you can do is to first learn the lines or verses that you feel are easiest or the ones that you feel are most melodious. If the words or music are appealing to you, they are easier to learn. Then, for each verse, write down the first two words and the last two words and learn only these. Like this, you can do jugglery with your mind.</p>
<p>There is another thing you can do. Over the years you have learned many, many of my writings by heart. If one line or one particular poem from some book of mine gives you immense joy, then repeat it ten or twenty times before you start practising the song. You will get real joy from your own retentive faculty.</p>
<p>When you feel that you have learned one page thoroughly, you can recite it three times instead of singing it. You will get more strength from your own recitation. The mind will say, "Oh, why do I have to recite it three times since I have learned it by heart?" But you have to break the mind's pride. On the one hand, the mind is unable to memorise it. On the other hand, when the mind feels that it has learned something, it is beneath the mind's dignity to repeat what it has learned again. So you have to break the mind's pride into pieces and then use the heart. At that time, feel that you are learning the song because you like it and not because you have to learn it.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is pray to the Supreme for a few minutes to give you the capacity to learn the song quicker than otherwise. There is nothing wrong with doing this. When I was a student I had a very powerful, extraordinary memory and many books I used to learn by heart. My teachers could not believe it, but it was all because of my prayer-life. Thousands and thousands of times I used to repeat a mantra to Saraswati, the goddess of learning. In your case, you do not have to learn the Sanskrit verses; just repeat "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no hard and fast rule. To put it simply and in a general way, the source of my poetry is the third eye. The vision-eye supplies the poetry for a seer-poet, but spiritual songs come directly from the heart. All my songs are of the heart, in the heart and for the heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If somebody is wearing a white cotton sari, people will appreciate its beauty and simplicity. This is like my poetry. Then again, if the same person wears a silk sari, it looks so beautiful. This is like my songs. Natural beauty I want from my songs and also from my poems, but my songs have more luminosity.</p>
<p>Poetry, in my case, is like a spontaneous fountain, whereas my music, you can say, is like a flowing, murmuring river. Only a few hundred of my Bengali songs originated as poems. Most of my 8,000 Bengali songs were songs right from the beginning. But my English songs almost always began as poems.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Try to visualise a beautiful garden inside your heart. If you see a beautiful garden, then soulfulness automatically will come. Or feel that you are seated alone at the foot of a tree, facing a river. That also will help you. But the other way is better; it will bring forward soulfulness very quickly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the soul's receptivity. When a disciple has a birthday, for example, I will very often invite him to sit in front of me to meditate. Sometimes I look at the individual for a long time because he is receiving so much. Then I am so happy, but my happiness you will not be able to see on my face. On other occasions I am only exercising my patience with the hope that after five or ten seconds the person will receive an iota of my light. In the end I am smiling, but you will not know if it is because the disciple received or only because I am showing compassion and hiding my sad face.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule about the amount of time it takes me to draw a bird. I may take only four seconds to draw a bird because that bird has tremendous receptivity, and after four seconds it satisfies me immensely. Or I may take many seconds to draw a bird because it is receiving so much light from me. Again, I may take half a minute to draw a bird, but if there is no receptivity, then it is useless. So the souls are not equal. Unfortunately or fortunately, some birds come with more potential. Or you can say they come from a somewhat higher or a somewhat lower world. They are not all coming from the same plane.</p>
<p>For a few days recently I was drawing my birds on white paper, and sometimes it happened that each page had a different receptivity. You will say, "O God, how can a blank page have receptivity? Receptivity is only inside the bird-consciousness." But that is not true; even the paper can have receptivity. Sometimes after drawing only six birds on a page, I see vividly that I do not need to draw any more. I am satisfied because the receptivity of the blank sheet is enough. Again, sometimes I do twenty birds because I see there is more receptivity on the page. Still other times I am not satisfied with the receptivity of the page, so I keep on drawing and drawing. It is not until I draw twenty, thirty or forty birds that I am satisfied with what I wanted to give to that particular page.</p>

But sometimes I feel I have to say something. At what point should I speak up?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the very beginning, before it becomes a serious case! If you know that somebody is doing something wrong, immediately you should warn that person or tell him very compassionately to stop. Always you have to act when it is a small thing — before it becomes a most serious disease. Do not wait one month or two months to see whether the individual is going to change his mind and adopt the right course. If someone is going away from the light, it will be difficult not only for him but also for you to come back to the light. So if you have real concern for that person, then right at the very beginning you have to beg him or beg her not to take the wrong step.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are driving the car, then I do not want you to take your hands off the wheel. You have to think of traffic and all kinds of things. And if you fold your hands while walking down the street, people will take you to the mental asylum. If you try to fold your hands while you are combing your hair, your hair will look peculiar! So, at these times, why do you have to sing out loud? You can sing in silence or you can chant "Supreme". But when you are in a proper place — at home in front of your shrine or in the meditation hall — then definitely you should fold your hands while singing <em>The Invocation.</em> You have to use your practical wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, why are you always making sure that we are comfortable and are eating enough, rather than teaching us austerity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, why are you always making sure that we are comfortable and are eating enough, rather than teaching us austerity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the Buddha did not eat, at that time did he realise God? It was only after he started following the middle path that he got enlightenment. We also are not going to the extreme. Because of my Indian background, my compassion, affection and kindness come to the fore. So I ask you, "Have you eaten?" I am not telling you to eat like ten pigs! Only I want you to eat as much as your body needs.</p>
<p>Knowing perfectly well that her child has eaten, the Bengali mother will tell him, "I will give you a coin for each sweet that you eat." Then she will give him rasgulla. I had that kind of mother; she always wanted to feed me. That is called either affection or stupidity. Even after the child has eaten, she will put something else in his mouth and get such joy when he eats it. But the next day she will be the sufferer when the child has stomach problems.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My mother is always asking me &quot;Have you eaten today? Have you eaten healthy food?&quot;</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: My mother is always asking me &amp;quot;Have you eaten today? Have you eaten healthy food?&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> "Have you eaten?" is the right question! The right question is not, "Have you eaten healthy food?" To the end of my life, I will speak ill of so-called healthy food that has no sugar, no salt, no oil and no taste. Too much sugar is not good, I agree. But food also has to give the mind joy.</p>
<p>The mind plays an important role in our physical well-being. People today are turning towards a vegetarian diet because animals eat so much rubbish. But when we eat vegetables, the mind has to feel that we are eating something very solid and nourishing. The mind has to feel that the vegetables have some strength in them. As soon as we think of cauliflower or potato, for example, the mind gets a sense of something solid. But if we think of a leafy vegetable like spinach or cabbage, at that time the mind does not get a feeling of strength. When we think of the leaf-consciousness, all our strength goes away.</p>
<p>The term 'salad', for example, will never give us the feeling of strength, but today everybody is eating salad. The fat man eats salad to lose weight and the thin man eats salad in order not to get fat. Unfortunately, the fat man is still gaining weight! If we want to get the utmost nourishment from salad, immediately from the word itself the idea has to enter into our mind that it is all-nourishing, that it is like a medicine that will cure all diseases.</p>
<p>Even the term 'bread' has real strength in it because down through the centuries bread has represented something very solid to the mind. The same is true of rice. If we say the word 'rice', immediately our whole being is satisfied. When we say 'bread' or 'rice', from head to foot we get some satisfaction. From the soles of our feet to the crown of our head, like an electric current there is the feeling that we are really eating something good. When we say 'bread and butter', the word 'butter' is not adding anything; it adds only fatness! But as soon as we say 'bread', our whole being is immediately nurtured.</p>
