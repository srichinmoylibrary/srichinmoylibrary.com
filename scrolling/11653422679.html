<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Kindness, loving kindness, is a divine aspect of God. Kindness comes from God's Compassion. When God's Compassion operates in a sincere seeker, that sincere seeker runs towards God. Compassion is like a magnet. Here on earth we call a particular thing kindness or sympathy, but in the inner world we see that this very thing comes directly from God's Compassion, from the highest realm of Consciousness. So when God's Consciousness and God's Compassion reign supreme in an individual soul, then he is bound to run towards God, the destined Goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you tell whether you are ambitious or are really aspiring?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you tell whether you are ambitious or are really aspiring?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are ambitious, what will happen? You will have a kind of aggressive vital. Then, even if you are also trying to get peace, light and bliss, I tell you there will always be some undivine element there. But if you are really trying to do your best, if you are really aspiring, there will not be this kind of aggressive movement. If a runner wants to exert himself to his utmost capacity and reach his best running speed, then that is his aspiration. But when there is ambition, immediately a kind of rivalry starts. Ambition wants to be the best in everything, but aspiration is different. It says, "I will do my best. If I want to engage in sports, I shall have to practise running. But the result, the achievement, will be entirely at the Feet of the Supreme."</p>
<p>At first I only want to achieve something, but if I get the feeling that I want to be on the top and that others should be at least one step below me, then this is ambition. Ambition always likes to be on top and hold others below it. But if it is aspiration, then I will aspire to go to the Highest, not because of my needs, but because of the Supreme's need to take me to the Highest, so that He can fulfil me in His own way. Aspiration will say: "If it is the Supreme's Will, let Him take me to the Highest. If it is His Will, let Him keep me at the lowest plane. Let Him keep me wherever He wants — at the foot of the tree, in the middle of the tree, at the top of the tree or far below the tree."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your aspiration is like a stove. You have to turn the gas up to a certain point before it ignites. If the knob is even a fraction of an inch below that point, then nothing happens, even though the gas is flowing. In your case, your aspiration was just a fraction of an inch away from coming to the fore. When I accepted you, I gave you the additional aspiration you needed to ignite your inner flame.</p>

Is there a way of staying in touch with that when we&#039;re not here, in your presence?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not my actual physical presence that is offering you this light or energy or whatever you call it. It is your own aspiration that is offering it to you. My physical presence may give you one per cent of the energy, peace, light and bliss that you are speaking of, but it is your own aspiration that is bringing about this kind of meditation here. So when you meditate at home, if you can meditate as devotedly and soulfully as you meditate here, then I assure you the Grace of the Supreme is bound to descend on your devoted heart. Then you will feel the same kind of peace, light and bliss right in your own room.</p>
<p>When you come here, you come with tremendous aspiration, but when you meditate at home, unfortunately you are wanting in aspiration. It is the lack of aspiration that prevents the seeker from receiving or achieving peace, light and bliss. Here you get a golden opportunity because many people are meditating together and one is inspiring another. So I wish you to have the same kind of aspiration when you meditate at home as you have had here. Then you will have no difficulty in feeling, achieving and growing into the boundless energy, light and bliss that you are talking about.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual world we use the term "acceptance." But who accepts whom first? We may call it a reciprocal acceptance: I accept God and God accepts me. But when we go deep within, we see that he who chooses the Supreme has already been chosen by the Supreme. It is God who has chosen each of us before we even dreamt of accepting Him as our very own. But now that we are consciously aware of His acceptance, we need not stumble, we need not walk, we need not march; we can run fast, faster and fastest, because our awareness is already God's infinite Grace. Millions and millions of people are fast asleep in the world of ignorance, whereas we are fortunate enough to have been aroused by the Supreme Himself. He has said to us, "Arise, awake, aspire." We have arisen. We are now totally awakened. We are now aspiring. The mounting flame of consciousness deep within us is climbing toward the highest. Arise, awake, aspire! These three soul-stirring words at every moment we shall cherish in our human existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Awareness is not of the mind. You want to be aware of the soul with your mind. You want to see the soul with your physical organs. But the physical organs are very, very deceptive, I must say. We are totally blind to the Truth sometimes. Truth comes to us in its natural way, but we try to see Truth from a different angle. So we do not really see it. But instead of trying to see the Truth, let us try to <em>feel</em> the Truth and become the Truth. When we become the Truth, at that time we do not have to see. I have a body, but I do not have to <em>see</em> whether I have arms or not. Similarly, when we become the Truth, at that time we do not have to see whether Truth has this or that. Just by being one with the Truth, we know what it is and what is has.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Happiness always has a kind of dynamic quality in it, whereas in joy there can be a very sweet, mild, subtle and serene quality. In happiness you can get an ecstatic movement, and you may lose your balance. But when it is subtle joy, inner joy, then you do not lose your outer balance. But this is only playing with words. Actually there is no difference between the soul's happiness and true joy. Happiness and joy are synonymous. But if you speak of joy and pleasure, then there is a difference. There is a great difference between joy and pleasure. Pleasure is always followed by frustration, depression and destruction. But joy is growth, joy is a constructive force that fulfils us. Joy is like a flower that blooms petal by petal. God created us in joy, God wants us to remain in joy and God wants us to fulfil our respective roles in utmost joy. If we remain in joy, in inner joy, only then can we make real progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can we have spiritual capacity without having spiritual pride?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can we have spiritual capacity without having spiritual pride?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Capacity and pride do not necessarily have to go together. What you call capacity I will call God's Grace. If you can do everything at your sweet will, then only you can have pride. But at your sweet will you cannot do whatever you choose. If somebody asks you not to sleep even for five minutes in twenty-four hours, you will probably not be able to do it. If somebody asks you to run the fastest, you won't be able to do it. And if you can do it, feel that whatever capacity you have is due to God's Grace.</p>
<p>If you feel you are spiritual and far superior to your father because you are accepting our path and he isn't, then just turn around and see if somebody else has more aspiration or deeper conviction than you have. But if you say you are still more spiritual than all the other disciples put together, then go one step further. Since I am the leader, then compare yourself with me: "Let me see if this Indian is really greater than I am in spirituality." If you feel that you are but an inch lower than I am, and that tomorrow you will catch me and surpass me, then you have to know that you are still an inch lower than somebody, and that somebody is God. Just compare yourself with God. Then your inner being will say, "Look at your capacity and God's infinite Capacity."</p>
<p>So if you expand human pride, a time will come when you will have to stop. A good musician can compare himself with the greatest musician, and then his pride will be smashed. A good runner will compare himself with the greatest runner, and then he will have to stop feeling proud. Suppose you feel that you are by far the best in something. I wish to say that there will always be a third person who will smash your pride.</p>
<p>But pride can also be a divine capacity. If someone is the world's greatest boxer, singer, spiritual figure or anything else, immediately identify yourself with that person and sincerely feel your oneness with him. If you have established your inseparable oneness with him, then your pride is divine pride. This divine pride can never be defeated.</p>
<p>Human pride is only a form of separation: I am this, you are that. I separate my existence from yours; therefore I am superior to you. But divine pride is oneness; it becomes one with others' capacities. From one individual you go to the length and breadth of the world. If you want to conquer pride in the human way, immediately you put someone with more capacity in front of you and that person in no time will shatter all your pride. If you want to take pride in the divine way, the whole world will be inside you on the strength of your oneness. At that time you don't have to separate the capacity of others from the reality that you are.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is good to imagine, but it has to be something that is inside the heart. After we imagine something, it becomes a reality in the heart. Imagination itself is reality. Feeling also is reality, but in feeling we cannot show the reality. But when we realise the reality, at that time we become reality itself.</p>

<h2>Question: In the conflict between intuition and common sense, which one should we listen to?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Intuition is the real truth. What people call common sense is not sense at all most of the time. Real common sense is something else. In real common sense, God comes first; the highest Reality comes first. Once a spiritual Master said by way of a joke, "When my disciples come to me, the first thing they do is to give up their common sense." When the disciples give up their ordinary common sense, then only can the Master give them his proper common sense. In the spiritual life, common sense means the higher reality. For spiritual people, the lower reality is not common.</p>
<p>Intuition is the higher reality, If you get an intuitive flash, that is absolutely the real reality. But if you feel that that particular intuition will not work on the physical plane, then the best thing is to discover the common sense which is utilised on the physical plane. You are eager to use common sense on the physical plane because it is applicable there. But again, if you really have an intuitive flash, then I wish to say that you should stick to your intuition even though the world may call you insane.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna all the time stayed with his intuition. Just because he used his intuitive power he went to the Highest. People said many, many undivine things about him. When he went into trance or ecstasy, people in the ordinary life used to say it was a kind of insanity. But for him, common sense was to be totally absorbed in the Mother Kali, totally merged in the highest Consciousness. For him that was the real common sense, the only common sense. But for ordinary people, common sense will be to mix with people or to indulge in ordinary things. So common sense depends entirely on the achievement of the soul and how developed the soul is.</p>
<p>Some of your parents may think that the spiritual life is silly; that is their common sense. But you have a higher sense. You have accepted the spiritual life, so you are much more developed than your parents, both inwardly and outwardly. For you, it is quite common to pray and meditate and follow a spiritual Master. The standard of your common sense and the standard of their common sense need not and cannot be the same. Again, when you go still higher, infinitely higher, at that time your intuition will become your common sense. You will not use the so-called common sense that you get from the mind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I make the silence I enjoy more fruitful?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I make the silence I enjoy more fruitful?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can make the silence you enjoy more fruitful by making it more dynamic. Inside the silence you have to feel creation. Silence embodies both the unreal and the real. When you watch the silence with your outer vision, then you feel that it is not creating anything in you; there is no dynamism there. But when you watch the silence with your inner vision, you see that silence has not only created something inside you but silence is creation itself. So if you see creation inside yourself, then the silence will be more fruitful.</p>
<p>You may see creation that does not itself create; only it has been created. It is like a tree that has been created from a seed. If you feel that the tree is the ultimate, then it is all over. But if you see that from the tree there will be some fruits, then the creation goes on. A tree and its fruits are inseparable. If you look at the fruit, then you will be looking at the tree. Again, if a tree does not have fruits and flowers, then it is not a tree at all. Here the tree is silence. If you dive deep within yourself, you will see that silence and its fruits have become one. If you see a tree, only a tree, then the creation is over; but if you feel that the tree will give flowers, fruits and new seeds, then your silence-tree becomes fruitful. So every time you see silence-creation, try to feel that from this creation another creation is taking place. Then you will be complete. At that time you will get continuous progress and continuous achievement from the thing that has already been created.</p>
<p>So, please feel that something has to come out of silence; then only will the silence be fruitful. Please feel that the silence is giving you something; then it becomes soulful and fruitful. Otherwise, it will all be barren — only an isolated experience, an isolated reality. In order for it to become fruitful, you have to feel that it embodies something and that it will give you something.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can know your spiritual status by diving deep within and entering into the state of mental equanimity. When you enter into that state of equanimity, easily you can know your spiritual status.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of emotions: divine emotions and human emotions. The development of human emotion leads to destruction, but the development of divine emotion leads to illumination, and this illumination is nothing but satisfaction. What is divine emotion? Divine emotion is our oneness with the transcendental Soul and our oneness with the universal Heart. Conscious, inseparable oneness is the divine emotion.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. The expression of your capacity is always important. You have to know that creative expression is motivated not by ego but by a higher force, an inner force, which wants you to manifest the divine truth in its own way.</p>
