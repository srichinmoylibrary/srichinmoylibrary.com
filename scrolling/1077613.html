 <p></p>
<h2>Has your soul a special mission?</h2>

<p>Your soul has a special mission. Your soul is supremely conscious of it.</p>
<p><em>Maya</em>, illusion or forgetfulness, makes you feel that you are finite, weak and helpless. This is not true. You are not the body. You are not the senses. You are not the mind. These are all limited. You are the soul, which is unlimited. Your soul is infinitely powerful. Your soul defies all time and space.</p>
<p>Can you ever realise your soul? Can you be fully conscious of your soul and be one with it? Certainly you can. For, in fact, you are nothing other than the soul. It is your soul that represents the natural state of consciousness. But doubt makes it difficult to realise the soul. Doubt is man’s fruitless struggle in the outer world. Aspiration is the seeker’s fruitful confidence in the inner world. Doubt struggles and struggles. Finally it defeats its own purpose. Aspiration flies upward to the Highest. At its journey’s end it reaches the Goal. Doubt is based on outer observation. Aspiration is founded on inner experience. Doubt ends in failure because it lives in the finite physical mind. Aspiration ends in success because it lives in the ever-climbing soul. A life of aspiration is a life of Peace. A life of aspiration is a life of Bliss. A life of aspiration is a life of divine Fulfilment.</p>
<p>To know what your special mission is, you have to go deep within. Hope and courage must accompany you on your tireless journey. Hope will awaken your inner divinity. Courage will make your inner divinity flower. Hope will inspire you to dream of the Transcendental. Courage will inspire you to manifest the Transcendental here on earth.</p>
<p>To feel what your special mission is, you have always to create. This creation of yours is something which you ultimately become. Finally you come to realise that your creation is nothing other than your self-revelation.</p>
<p>True, there are as many missions as there are souls. But all missions fulfil themselves only after the souls have achieved some degree of perfection. The world is a divine play. Each participant plays a part in its success. The role of the servant is as important as that of the master. In the perfection of each individual part is the collective fulfilment. And at the same time, the individual fulfilment becomes perfect only when the individual has established his inseparable connection and realised his oneness with all human beings of the world.</p>
<p>You are one from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. Yet at one place you are called ears, at another place you are called eyes. Each place in your body has a name of its own. Strangely enough, although they all are part of the same body, one cannot perform the action of another. Eyes see, but they cannot hear. Ears hear, but they cannot see. So the body, being one, also is many. Similarly, although God is one, He manifests Himself through many forms.</p>
<p>God tells us our mission. But we do not understand God’s language, so He has to be His own interpreter. When others tell us about God, they can never tell us fully what God is. They misrepresent and we misunderstand. God speaks in silence. Also, He interprets His message in silence. So also let us hear and understand God in silence.</p>
<p>Has your soul a special mission? Yes. Your mission is in the inmost recesses of your heart and you have to find and fulfil it there. There can be no external way for you to fulfil your mission. The deer grows musk in his own body. He smells it and becomes enchanted, and tries to locate its source. He runs and runs, but he cannot find the source. In his endless search, he loses all his energy and finally he dies. But the source he was so desperately searching for was within himself. How could he find it elsewhere?</p>
<p>Such is the case with you. Your special mission — which is the fulfilment of your divinity — is not outside you, but within you. Search within. Meditate within. You will discover your mission.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is atman?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Sanskrit <em>atman</em> means the individual soul and <em>paramatman</em> means the Self. Each individual human being has a soul. When the soul, through its own aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation, enters into the Cosmic Self, then it completes its journey on earth.</p>
<p>Everybody has <em>atman</em>. There are other members in the spiritual family: body, vital, mind and heart. These members, if they listen to the <em>atman</em> like obedient children, become conscious instruments of God. Right now we are unconscious instruments of God. The soul is always the conscious instrument of God and it is inspiring us, begging us to listen to God, the Inner Pilot. The soul is the eldest brother in the family. It says to the others, “Let us listen to the Father, to the Inner Pilot. If we listen to the Father, then we will become His conscious instruments and God’s full divine manifestation will be able to take place here on earth.”</p>
<p>If the members of a family listen to the eldest member, then that family is harmonious. Similarly, if the body, vital, mind and heart listen to the soul’s request, then the individual will make spiritual progress. If any member is unwilling to listen, then there is quarrelling, fighting and disharmony in the inner life of that particular person. All spiritual figures and sincere seekers of the infinite Truth feel that it is their bounden duty to listen to the soul, which is the conscious representative of God here on earth in each individual human being.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created the soul when He started His creation, when He wanted to become many. God wanted to become many so that He could enjoy Himself in many forms. We cannot state a particular time because He is not bound by our time. He dwells in endless, eternal time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul knows that it has come from Infinity and that here on earth it is moving in Infinity and marching or running forward to its home, which is all Infinity and Eternity. The soul is playing a game and that game is called the game of manifestation. Each time the soul enters into the world it makes the solemn promise that it will manifest God here on earth. This time your soul has accepted a particular body and it is trying to manifest something divine on earth through this body. In its next incarnation it will take another body to manifest other divine qualities.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do all souls want the same thing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do all souls want the same thing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In a very broad sense they do, but individual souls want different aspects of the Divine at different times. Some want particularly the manifestation of the divine Light, some want above all perfection of the inner and outer life and some particularly want oneness with the Inner Pilot. These three qualities are not like rungs of a ladder; they are not in ascending order like aspiration, realisation, revelation and manifestation. Let us say they are three different planes of consciousness. All three are equally important. According to our willingness and capacity, we should pay attention to all three. But one of the three is the most important factor in each soul’s evolution, either for a few years or for your entire life.</p>
<p>You may be more fond of your eyes than of your ears and nose. But in order to be perfect, you need your eyes, ears and nose. If you want to give more importance to your eyes, you can do so. By giving importance to your eyes, you become fully aware of your utmost love for them. But again, in order to be perfect, you need your eyes, your ears and your nose.</p>
<p>An individual soul may want either oneness with the Inner Pilot or manifestation of the divine Light or perfection of the inner and outer life for one incarnation. It may even happen that after three years, four years or twenty years the soul will change its wish. We cannot say that the one who now wants oneness with the Inner Pilot does not care for the manifestation of the divine Light. He does care, but right now he cares more for another aspect, which is oneness with the Inner Pilot. It is not possible to compare these three. The best category is the one that a particular soul wants for the time being, or for a few years, or for the whole incarnation. Whatever the soul wants from your life is the most important thing in your life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The realised soul remains with the body. If the soul remains in the body when a person is realised, then he can consciously work for the divinity in humanity. He will feel at that time that he is a conscious instrument of God, that God is the Doer and God is the Action and that God is utilising him. When the veil of ignorance is removed, the soul gets the greatest opportunity to fulfil God’s Mission on earth. At that time there is no death, no destruction, no ignorance around the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, everyone eventually has to realise God. In life there are two rooms. One is all light and knowledge and the other is all darkness and ignorance. The criminals have chosen to stay in the room that is all darkness. But one day they will see that the other room is much more fulfilling. Then naturally they won’t want to stay in darkness anymore. They will come out and enter into the other room that is full of light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Which dominates the body, the mind or the soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Which dominates the body, the mind or the soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is supposed to dominate the body, but sometimes the vital dominates the body and sometimes the mind dominates the body. Actually, the soul does not dominate; it inspires. When the mind or the vital wants to get something done by the body, they do not hesitate to use force. But the soul will never force; the soul is always acting through inspiration and love.</p>
<p>It is easier for the soul to inspire the body through the heart than through the mind. A child can be inspired most easily through the heart. But one can also see and feel the psychic movement in an old man of eighty years. How is it that we can see an old man acting like a child? It is just because the soul is inspiring him through the heart. If he is not a spiritual person, naturally he himself will not know what is happening. He will think, “My days are numbered, so let me now act like a child, let me regain my childhood.” But what actually happens is that since the soul has love and concern for the body, the soul inspires the body through the heart. So where the soul is concerned, what we observe is inspiration, and where the vital and mind are concerned, what we see is domination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Consciousness is always connected with the soul. But what we in our human life call consciousness is not real consciousness at all; it is a mere feeling. When we perceive something subtle which we cannot define, we call this awareness of ours consciousness; this is actually not real consciousness at all. It is rather very subtle desire. We enter into it and immediately we feel that it is our consciousness. But real consciousness is the Light which connects Heaven and earth. Heaven itself is in our consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness and the soul can never be separated, whereas the body can easily be separated from the soul and also from consciousness. When we use the term ‘physical consciousness’, we are referring to the finite consciousness. It is a portion of the infinite Consciousness which has entered into the gross physical and is now possessed and utilised by the physical itself. The same can also occur with the vital consciousness and the mental consciousness. But the divine Consciousness is a vast unity which houses silence and power. When it houses silence, it houses its own true form. When it houses power, it manifests its inner reality.</p>
<p>The soul, which is eternal, and Consciousness, which is infinite, go together. They have a common source, which is Life, eternal Life. The soul has eternal Life and consciousness also has eternal Life. They complement each other. The soul expresses its divinity through Consciousness and Consciousness expresses its all-pervading silence through the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we think of the light of the soul, immediately we have to feel that what we get from this light is illumination and transformation. Otherwise, the soul’s light will remain vague to us. We see the light of electricity, but no matter what voltage we use, this light cannot change our nature. It will not be able to offer anything to our inner life. But when we become conscious of the light of the soul in our spiritual life, we feel that this light not only illumines our lives but also convinces us that the soul’s light alone is real; all else is unreal. If the mind feels that it has no reality unless and until it is flooded with the light of the soul, then only is the mind sincere and aspiring.</p>
<p>How can you bring the light of the soul into the mind so that you can have constant love, devotion and surrender? Please feel that the mind is your possession and not that you are possessed by the mind. You are the possessor of your finger, it does not possess you. You have full control over your finger. Similarly, you possess money and you use it in your own way. But if the money possesses you with its material power, then it will corrupt your nature. You will be caught by greed and attachment. Money itself is not bad, but it is misused to such an extent that very often a wrong force operates through it. The same is true of the mind. If you feel, “Oh, my mind is using me all the time and I cannot do anything,” then you are helpless. Your mind should be like your finger. Your finger cannot utilise you if you know that it is yours, that it is under your control. Similarly, with your conscious will you have to make the mind your servant.</p>
<p>You can meditate and tell your mind, “I shall not allow you to go in your own way. Now I want to think of God.” Repeat the name of God inwardly or aloud. The next moment say, “I want to have purity in my whole existence. Then repeat ‘purity, purity, purity.’ At that time you are not allowing your mind to think of impurity or of some other person or thing. Don’t give your mind a chance to wander; simply utilise your mind for your own purpose. You have millions of things to accomplish in and through the mind. But the mind is so naughty and mischievous that if you don’t utilise it, it will utilise you.</p>
<p>So I wish to tell you from now on please make the mind feel that it is your slave, that it is at your command. Do you want to use your mind for a divine purpose twenty-four hours a day? Then do so. Each time you want to achieve something, just catch the mind and say, “Do this, do this, do this.” Utilise the mind for the divine purpose of thinking of God, meditating on God and concentrating on God. In this way you can easily bring the mind under your control. Once the mind is under your control, you can then offer it to the Supreme. And the moment you can offer the mind to the Supreme. you will see that the soul’s light has already entered into the mind and has started illumining the mind. When the mind is illumined, love becomes absolutely pure, devotion becomes absolutely intense and surrender becomes complete, unconditional and constant.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The highest light actually comes from the soul. If you can get free access to the soul, you will be able to bring to the fore the light from within. You have to meditate on the heart because inside the heart is the soul. The moment you have free access to the inner being or to the soul, you will see that the light is coming to the fore to permeate your whole existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can develop inner power by becoming one with the will of the soul. The soul is the representative of the Highest, the Absolute Supreme. If we want to acquire inner power, we should try to concentrate on the inner being or on the soul. When we become aware of the soul’s operation in the outer plane, we will be aware of our inner power. Inner power the soul has, not only in abundant measure, but in infinite measure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes the soul leaves the body and looks at the physical body. I first had this experience at the age of twelve. My soul came out of my body while I was sitting on my cot. My own soul and my own body were standing face to face and I was looking with the eye of my soul at my physical body.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Apart from giving you reports or telling you important things, do the souls of your disciples ever come to you just out of joy or gratitude?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Apart from giving you reports or telling you important things, do the souls of your disciples ever come to you just out of joy or gratitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, they come when there is sad news or good news and at other times they come out of joy and gratitude. Sometimes the soul cannot visit me because the disciple’s vital is not receptive. The vital may not receive my blessing at the time I offer it. But after two hours or so, the soul is successful in assimilating light in the vital.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a disciple fell very sick. She had a very high fever and was delirious. I blessed her once, but she was in another world. Then after five or six minutes I blessed her again. At that time I put a very strong force on her. Her soul and heart received it immediately, but her mind and vital were in another world and were not receiving my light. The soul was trying so hard, but the mind and the vital were not receptive, even though the soul was full of devotion and gratitude. Later that night, the soul of the disciple came to me and I meditated on her. Her soul felt miserable because the physical was not grateful. The soul was like a mother who is miserable because her child has not expressed gratitude for a gift he received from someone. But I felt that as long as the soul received light, my spiritual daughter would be all right and I would be happy. Why does the human parent or the spiritual parent need gratitude from the daughter? I felt that if she did not suffer the following morning, if I could hear from her that she was all right, then that would be more than enough for me.</p>
<p>The next morning when I was meditating on the disciple, this soul came to me and at last the physical, vital, mind and heart received what I offered and were full of devotion, gratitude and surrender. The soul had convinced the physical, vital and mind that they were wrong before. The soul at that time became the lord.</p>
