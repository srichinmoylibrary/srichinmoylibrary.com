<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God lives not only in Guru's heart, but in your heart and in everybody's heart. Why does He live in Guru's heart? When you say He lives in Guru's heart that means that you feel that He lives only in Guru's heart and not in your heart. If this is your feeling, then I wish to say that God lives in Guru's heart because Guru knows that inside his heart is a small room. The name of that room is called gratitude-room. God always lives inside that small room. Since Guru lives in that room, he sees and feels God all the time. When you also do the same, when you also feel gratitude, then you too will discover the gratitude-room inside your heart. You will see that God lives inside your heart as well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Guru communicates with these souls through God's inner Light. God being omnipresent means He is everywhere, so through God's Light Guru communicates with the souls while they are on earth and after they leave the earth. Through this inner Light, Guru can easily enter into all souls. Whether they are on earth or in Heaven, God's Light can easily enter into them and talk with them.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God stays alive because He takes two types of food. One food is man's inner cry. He likes it very much. He eats another food that is called His Compassion. In Heaven He eats His Compassion-food and on earth He eats cry-food. When man cries to Him, He eats cry-food on earth. By eating the foods of Compassion and cry, He will always remain alive.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is up in the sky and He is also on earth. Why is God up in the sky? This is your question. It is the books we read about God, especially in the Western world, and your parents who have taught you that God is up in the sky. I wish to say that God is up in the sky, but He is also here on earth. If you read the inner book inside your heart, then you will see that God is also on earth. He is not only in the Heavens. Since you are on earth, I tell you that although He is all-pervading, the God-consciousness on earth is infinitely more important for you than God who is in the sky, in Heaven.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God got His first beginning from His Silence. He remained silent and inside His Silence He got a message. When He was in silence, He was One alone. He felt no loneliness as we do when we stay alone. But even when He was alone, He was complete because He Himself was Silence and He Himself was both the Observer and the Enjoyer of that Silence. God started His first beginning with Silence. Then He became many with His Sound-Light. With His Silence-Light He was one. With His Sound-Light He became many.</p>

What is devotion? What is surrender? Love is to cry for God, devotion is to smile when you see God and surrender is to dance with joy when God is in your presence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You <em>can</em> be with God. As a matter of fact you are always with God. But you have to be consciously with God. That is to say that when God is in front of you or inside your heart, you have to recognise God. Only if you pray to Him with folded hands in front of your shrine early in the morning and in the evening, then you can become one with God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear child, first of all, I shall definitely die, but I am not going to take another human incarnation unless the Supreme changes His Plan. There is no wish and no necessity on my part to come back again. I have worked very hard on earth and I am ready to do the rest from above, from Heaven. So, since there is no possibility of my returning to the physical plane, with a physical body, I unfortunately cannot become either you or Nathan or Ruth or Suvikash. But you, your father, brother and mother will come back again and again. What for? To work for the Supreme in me, in your Guru.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the path to God what is purity and what is realisation? On the path to God, purity is the fragrance of a flower and realisation is the flower. Both are equally important. If you don't have fragrance, then the flower is useless. If you do not have a flower, how can you have fragrance? So both flower and fragrance are of equal need and importance. If you feel the presence of a flower inside your heart, then if you smell the fragrance, you are perfectly safe and you will be able to reach your destined Goal without fail.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The first man was born on earth by God's Will, God's Willpower. If you read the Bible you will learn the story about Adam and Eve. But if you read your inner life story, then you will know how God created, and whom God created — how God created the first human being, and whom God created first on earth. The first human being was born by God's Will through the evolutionary process, through the continuous and gradual process of the animal kingdom.</p>

It can be three years, it can be six years, it can be forty years, one hundred years or two hundred years. It entirely depends on God's Will. But if 'you' is directed towards me, then I wish to say there is no hope, no possibility and no necessity for me to come back to earth. Whatever work is to be done after my death, I will be able to do from Heaven in and through my disciples. I do hope at that time that my disciples will have become better than they are now.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is definitely a human being like us. Unfortunately, we do not recognise Him. Why do we not recognise Him as a human being? Because inside us there is a special eye and a special heart. When once that special eye and special heart are opened, then you will easily be able to see that like us, He is a human being. This eye is between our two ordinary eyes and a little above. The spiritual heart is inside our ordinary heart. So if you can see that heart and feel your presence there, if you can see your third eye and also feel your presence, then you will easily be able to know that God is also a human being like you and me.</p>

<h2>Question: How does God know everything about me?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God knows everything about you because He has created you. When you do something, you know everything you have done because it is you who have done it. If you have drawn a picture, you will know from the very beginning what you have done; therefore, if I ask you how you have done it, you will be able to tell me everything in detail. Similarly, God has created you. Since He has created you, He is bound to know everything about you.</p>
