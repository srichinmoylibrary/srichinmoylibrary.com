<h2>Man immortalised</h2>

<p>To perfect our human life, by far the greatest necessity is our soul's delight. When we live in the physical, the teeming clouds of desire are natural, necessary and inevitable. When we live in the soul, the ever-mounting flames of aspiration are natural, necessary and inevitable.</p>
<p>When we live in the soul, we spontaneously cultivate God. His Peace, Bliss and Power become ours, absolutely ours. We grow into our spiritual perfection. This perfection is at once our divine heritage in a human body and our unearthly birthright on earthly soil.</p>
<p>The human in us must live under the sheltering wings of the soul. The divine in us must fly and fly into the Beyond with the flying wings of the soul. The human in us must eventually need transformation. The divine in us must eventually need manifestation.</p>
<p>We expect everything from God. It is supremely good and perfectly reasonable, for who else can fulfil us, both in Heaven and on earth? God is our Face within; God is our Smile without.</p>
<p>God determines everything in us, through us and for us. He is utterly unconditional and infinitely self-giving. Him we serve. Our self-dedicated service unveils Him.</p>
<p>Man's achievement is a supremely unparalleled miracle.</p>
<p>God's achievement is the marriage of His Infinite with His finite.</p>
<p>Lo, God unveiled, man immortalised!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Will</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Will" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Will is myself. Will is my Self. My will is absolutely God's and God's alone.</p>
<p>As my inner will is, in the world of realisation, so is my outer life, in the world of manifestation.</p>
<p>To my mind's doubt, nothing is real. To my heart's will, everything is real. To conquer my doubts is to grow into the breath of my will.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of my emotions and frustrations. My emotions and frustrations live in my surrendered will to God, and will always rejoice in His adamantine Will.</p>
<p>When my inner will energises my outer existence, all my imponderable troubles and excruciating pangs dissolve into thin air.</p>

<p>Doubt wants to blight my mind.<br /> Fear wants to kill my heart.<br /> Ignorance wants to veil my soul.</p>
<p>Aspiration wants to illumine my life.<br /> Surrender wants to fulfil my life.<br /> Will wants to immortalise my life.</p>

<p>My earthly will has always a beginning and an end. My Heavenly will has no beginning and no end. It has always been and will always be the same. My will is Eternity's Abode of Truth, built on the rock of God's Vision-in-Reality and God's Reality-in-Vision.</p>

<p>O my body, you are a gift of the Supreme. Potentiality inexhaustible you have, deep within you. To misunderstand you means to misunderstand the chosen instrument of God.</p>
<p>You want not, you must not, you cannot conquer the length and breadth of the world with your physical strength. Offer your growing heart to the hearts far and near. Offer your glowing soul to the souls around, below, above. Then alone you become the conqueror and possessor of God's entire universe.</p>
<p>O my body, invoke your soul always for you to lead. Invoke! Never shall the monotony of the uneventful life plague you. With lightning speed yours shall be the ceaseless march... upward to the highest, inward to the inmost, forward to the farthest.</p>
<p>Sing, sing the song of Bliss in Immortality! Breathe, breathe in the breath of Consciousness in Immortality! Live, live the life of Existence in Immortality!</p>
<p>Death? Die you must not. For your death will be a great loss to humanity and by far a greater loss to Divinity. Fight, O my body, fight with ignorance to the bitterest end. Never allow ignorance to envelop you, your outer cloak. Your tearing efforts shall be crowned with success.</p>
<p>O body of mine, fare you well for Eternity. May each earthly year of yours have a trillion fulfilling years.</p>
<p>God the Eternal Dreamer is dreaming through you, with you. God the Eternal Reality is living for you, with you and in you.</p>

<p>O my vital, my first choice falls on you. Without your dynamic and stupendous inner urge, nothing can be embodied, nothing can be revealed here on earth.</p>
<p>O my vital, when you fall fast asleep, my mind's undying frustration grips my outer existence. My body's helpless surrender to the Prince of Gloom poisons my inner existence.</p>
<p>Man's most powerful imagination fails to fathom you, your depth. Man's far-flung, brightest wisdom fails to determine you, your breadth.</p>
<p>Yours is the indomitable courage that springs from the fountain of boundless emotion. Kill not your emotion, never. Emotion killed within, fulfilment starved without. Emotion divinely fed within, God the Eternal Delight revealed without.</p>
<p>O my vital, you know no tomorrow. You want to be born, you want to grow and fulfil yourself in the immediacy of today. With the infinite Blessings of the Supreme, on you march across the path of Infinity's bloom, Eternity's glow and Immortality's lustre.</p>
<p>Your life is green, the ever-aspiring and ever-growing green. Your breath is blue, the ever-encompassing and ever-transforming blue.</p>

<p>O my mind, no earthly chain can fetter you. You are always on the wing. No human thought can control you. You are forever on the move.</p>
<p>O my mind, hard is it for you to believe in my soul's constant fulfilment. And hard is it for me to believe that you are doomed to be the eternal victim of venomous doubts. Alas! You have forgotten. You have forgotten the golden secret: to remain in the silence-room is to open the fulfilment-door.</p>
<p>O my mind, vast are your responsibilities. You have to please your superiors: the heart and the soul. Only with your warmest admiration will you be able to conquer the heart. Only with your deepest faith will you be able to conquer the soul. You have also to satisfy your subordinates: the body and the vital. Only with your pure concern will you be able to make the body smile. Only with your genuine encouragement will you be able to help the vital run unmistakably towards good and not pleasure.</p>
<p>O my mind, I need you desperately, either to abide in you or to go beyond you. You see and thus protect the physical in me. You serve and thus reveal the spiritual beyond me.</p>
<p>O my mind, cast aside your long-treasured arid reason. Welcome the ever-virgin faith. Possess the naked sword of conscience. Far above the storms of fear you are destined to climb. Stay no more in self-created sombre shadows of death. Don the golden robes of simplicity, sincerity and purity. Permit not the gales of disbelief to extinguish your inner mounting flame. Yours is the arrow of concentration. Yours is the soil of lightning intuition. Yours is the unhorizoned peace.</p>

<p>O my heart, I am divinely proud of you. You do not have the shameful and shameless disease — worry! Never do you drink the deadly venom — doubt! Nothing can be simpler than your pure longings. Nothing can be more spontaneous than your glowing feelings. Nothing can be more fulfilling than your selfless love. Nothing has a more immediate access to the Supreme than your inmost cry.</p>
<p>O my heart, your Heavenly day within an earthly day is for God-realisation. Your immortalising minute within a fleeting minute is for God-embodiment. Your revealing second within a vanishing second is for God-manifestation.</p>
<p>O my heart, the others members of the family are afraid of God. You are never! Their lightless, persistent fear is a lifeless, persistent paralysis. In life's journey, others make their own choice. God makes the choice for you. They want to save humanity with their ego's darkest night. You wish to serve humanity with your dedication's brightest day. Their victory is the victory over humanity. Your victory is the victory over yourself.</p>
<p>O my heart, O heart of mine, you are my life-boat. You sail the uncharted seas of ignorance and reach the Golden Shore of the Beyond.</p>
<p>I am not alone, O my heart. I am with your soaring aspiration. You are not alone. In you and for you is my life's unreserved breath.</p>
<p>Yours is the unfaltering will and unfailing faith in the Supreme. Each petal of the radiant lotus deep within you is perpetually bathed in nectar-rays of the Transcendental Delight.</p>
<p>O sweet, sweeter, sweetest heart of mine, you are not only God's. God also is yours.</p>

<p>Man forgets. God forgives. Man forgets God's Truth. God forgives man's ignorance.</p>
<p>Man soars. God grows. Man soars in God. God grows in man.</p>
<p>Man loves love, because he does not have it. God loves love, because He is all Love.</p>
<p>Man aspires. God inspires. Man aspires. Lo, God descends. God inspires. Lo, man ascends.</p>
<p>Man cries. God's compassion flies to touch man's heart. God cries. Man supplies the message: "It is too early. Wait, you have to wait."</p>
<p>Man is always late in praying and accepting. God is never late in listening and granting. To converse with God, man has his throbbing prayer. God has His illumining Bliss to converse with man. To commune with God, man has his silent meditation. God has His urgent Peace to commune with man.</p>
<p>Absolute freedom is not a human achievement. It is a blessing of God. Darkest bondage is not a divine achievement. It is an offering of man.</p>
<p>Man wants to know himself and free himself. God wants to reveal Himself and manifest Himself. Man wants to discover Heaven in the highest plane of consciousness. God wants to uncover Heaven here on earth and nowhere else.</p>
<p>God gives to man what He has and what He is — Love, Joy, Peace, Bliss and Power. Man gives to God what he has not and what he is not — promise! Human promise! Human promise to God for God!</p>

<p>Man invents war. Man discovers peace. He invents war from without. He discovers peace from within. War man throws. Peace man sows. The smile of war is the flood of human blood. The smile of peace is the love, below, above.</p>
<p>Peace is the whole truth that wishes to enrapture humanity. War is the whole falsehood that wants to capture humanity. Peace begins in the soul and ends in the heart. War begins in the mind and ends in the body.</p>
<p>War forgets peace. Peace forgives war. War is the death of the life human. Peace is the birth of the Life Divine. Our vital passions want war. Our psychic emotions desire peace.</p>
<p>War is clear futility in dire spear-stupidity. Peace is flowing Infinity in glowing Eternity.</p>
<p>Man seeks war when he thinks that the world is not his. Man invites war when he feels that he can conquer the world. Man proclaims war when he dreams that the world has already surrendered to him.</p>
<p>Man seeks peace because his earthly existence desperately needs it. Man welcomes peace because he feels that in peace alone is his life of achievement and fulfilment. Man spreads peace because he wants to transcend death.</p>
<p>The animal in man wars against peace in the outer world, in the world of conflicting ideas. The divine in man wars against ignorance in the inner world, in the world of mounting ideals.</p>
<p>The animal in man wants war for the sake of war, war to devour the snoring world. The divine in man wants peace for the sake of peace, peace to feed the hungry world.</p>

<p>My human pride feels that I can do everything. My divine pride, the pride that has surrendered itself to the Will of God, knows that I can do everything only when I am inspired, guided, and helped by the Supreme.</p>
<p>My human pride wants the world to understand me, my love, my help and sacrifice. My divine pride, which is the feeling of oneness with all in God, does not wish the world to understand my selfless activities. It feels that if God understands me, knows my motives, then there can be no greater reward.</p>
<p>My human pride drinks the hot water of life — sufferings, struggles and doubts — without a spoon. The result is that my tongue gets badly burnt. My divine pride drinks the same hot water, nay, infinitely more in quantity, but it uses a spoon to drink with, so I suffer not. This spoon is the spoon of liberation, freed from the shackles of ignorance.</p>
<p>My human pride is afraid of saying and ashamed of doing many things. My divine pride is not afraid of saying anything and not ashamed of doing anything, for it knows that God is at once the Doer and the action. Whom am I to be afraid of? What am I to be ashamed of?</p>
<p>My human pride crushes humanity with man-acquired power. My divine pride liberates humanity with God-given Power.</p>
<p>When I say that God is mine and I can use Him at my sweet will, I harbour my human pride. But when I say that I am God's, and my very existence is at His Behest and at His Feet, I cherish divine pride.</p>
<p>To my human pride, the material world says, "We shall either succeed or we shall fail and perish." To my divine pride, the spiritual world says, "Together shall we endeavour, together shall we succeed."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My silence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My silence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My silence bridges the gulf between my life's success and my life's failure. My silence does not magnify my defects. Nor does it connive at them. My silence transforms my defects into strength indomitable.</p>
<p>My silence is a climbing flame that warms my world of despair. My silence is my inner light. No problem of mine can defy solution. My silence is a selfless distributor of joy to ever-widening horizons.</p>
<p>In my silence I become a man of sterling character, a prolific writer, a voracious reader, a divine lover, a profound inspirer and a triumphant liberator.</p>
<p>In my deep silence I never become a victim to ignorance, the greatest calamity that can befall any human being. In my growing silence I am convinced that even as a man on this earth, I shall be able to reach heights transcendental, divine.</p>
<p>My glowing silence alone can accelerate my Godward march.</p>
<p>My spreading silence makes me see, feel and possess satisfaction, unalloyed satisfaction. No more have I to let loose a tirade of tenebrous dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>In activity and vitality I proudly and wrongly feel that I shall have to take care of the whole world. In the heart of silence I humbly and unmistakably realise that it is the Divinity within the world that took care, takes care and shall for ever take care of the entire world.</p>
<p>Silence is my unceasing petition. Silence is my unreserved preparation. Silence is my unlimited realisation. Silence is the unfathomable fount of my life here on earth, there in Heaven.</p>
<p>What God's Silence is, is the eternal Truth. What God's Silence serves is the eternal Purpose. What God's Silence becomes is the inevitable Fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My love of light</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My love of light" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My love of light is my spiritual will. Within it is the power infinite. I give fear no place in my life. My love of light is God's Smile of satisfaction. God's supreme Love manifests in me and through me to transform my human problems into my divine opportunities.</p>
<p>My animal human love is my unnatural experience and uncertain possibility. My divine human love is my natural experience and certain inevitability of my living in the eternal Now.</p>
<p>My love throbbingly says: "God is all Blessing."</p>
<p>God's Love smilingly says: "My child is all gratitude."</p>
<p>Love radiates the life of harmony, brightens the joy-consciousness and sharpens the sword of intuition. Love is always ready to meet man's every soulful demand. Love conquers all that is unlike God. It is, indeed, supreme over all.</p>
<p>Love gives me my importance in the cosmic Vision of God. Nobody remembers me save my love. My sole treasure is love. Love's treasure is God's Heart.</p>
<p>Love is the undeniable truth of my identity as God's son, chosen son. Love is the unique combination of Heaven's freedom and earth's discipline. In Heaven's freedom is earth's emancipation. In earth's discipline is Heaven's manifestation.</p>
<p>No time-born desire can rend my love of light. My love of light flies beyond the widespread net of death. Mine is the love that has the birthless origin and the deathless end.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Self-sacrifice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Self-sacrifice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A human being has many divine qualities. But there has never been another unparalleled divine quality like man's self-sacrifice, nor can there ever be. God's own soulful Message to humanity in all walks of life is self-sacrifice. The brightest self-sacrifice can easily ease and diminish the darkest trials and stresses of human life.</p>
<p>He who is all sacrifice can never go through life as a failure. His is the perpetual victory. His is the spontaneous inner joy. What is to be sacrificed? One's life-breath. How to sacrifice? With the feeling of universal oneness.</p>
<p>To despair's invitation, self-sacrifice says, "No." To delight's invitation, self-sacrifice says, "Yes."</p>
<p>God secretly blesses me from Heaven when I wish to grow into sacrifice. God openly blesses me on earth when my earthly existence becomes all sacrifice.</p>
<p>Man's choice is joy. Joy's choice is sacrifice. Sacrifice's choice is nothing. This nothing is verily the unfoldment of everything, and the fulfilment of man and God.</p>
<p>A man of no sacrifice wants to possess the world with his strongest might. A man of sacrifice wishes to be possessed by the world with his all-surrendering right. To love life is to sacrifice our divinity within. To sacrifice life is to transform our humanity without.</p>
<p>When I sacrifice my material possessions, I see God coming smilingly towards me. When I sacrifice my austerities, I see God marching dynamically towards me. When I sacrifice my spiritual achievements, I see God running speedily towards me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Love devotion surrender</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Love devotion surrender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Love is action. Devotion is practice. Surrender is experience.</p>
<p>Love is realisation. Devotion is revelation. Surrender is manifestation.</p>
<p>Love is the meaning of life. Devotion is the secret of life. Surrender is the Goal of life.</p>
<p>In my love, I see God the Mother. In my devotion, I see God the Father. In my surrender, I see God the Mother and God the Father together in one body.</p>
<p>Love without devotion is absurdity. Devotion without surrender is futility.</p>
<p>Love with devotion was my journey's start. Devotion with surrender is my journey's close.</p>
<p>I love the Supreme because I came from Him. I devote myself to the Supreme because I wish to go back to Him. I surrender myself to the Supreme because He lives in me and I in Him.</p>
