  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when I have good experiences, or when I feel touched by nature or anything good, my mind tries to express it either in poetry or painting or some other way. But doing so seems to rob me of the experience itself.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when I have good experiences, or when I feel touched by nature or anything good, my mind tries to express it either in poetry or painting or some other way. But doing so seems to rob me of the experience itself." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Here you are making a mistake; you are acting like a child. When you get the experience, you are like a child who has got a candy from his mother or father. Then, when it is in his hand, he tries to share it with others. This is very good. Let him share; let him give a small portion to others. But let us say that the child has a very liberal heart. He has three or four friends and he gives everything away. Then he still feels hungry. When you have something, it is good to share it with others. But the best thing is to first try and increase the quantity of the thing. While you are having this good experience, try to keep it for a long time: an hour, two hours, three hours or a few days. In this way you will have accumulated a lot of candy. Then, while you are expressing it, you will not feel like a beggar.</p>
<p>When you express something, it is going out of you, and you have no means to replace it. You are scattering everything and then you are lost. Since you don't have the capacity to replace it, you are completely emptying yourself. Yes, you may have a very good heart, a very liberal heart. But you also have hunger, your own eternal hunger, and your own hunger you have not been able to satisfy. So if you can maintain or strengthen your experience for a few days or a few weeks, then when you try to express it and share it with others, you will not lose everything. You will have a continual and permanent access to the world of experience. So let it be permanent. Once you become permanent in your experience or realisation, then if you start giving it to others, you won't miss it or lose it. That is why they say that before you become a real Yogi, before you fully realise God, it is not advisable to give your inner wealth to others. It is not that you are a miser; only you are giving and giving and have no way to get it back. There is a Source, and you have to establish a connection with the Source. Then, no matter how much you give, you will not feel that you have lost anything.</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, a kindergarten teacher is enough for a kindergarten student. If you have gone to high school you can easily teach a five-year-old, because you have more education than he does. In the spiritual life, unfortunately, it is not like that. In the spiritual life, he who is your student is not only a student but also a bundle of ignorance. Although you may be an inch higher than he is, or although you may have started your spiritual life two days, two months or even ten years before he did, if your realisation is not solid or concrete and you try to teach that person, then the ignorance of that person will overpower you. Then, if you lose, who is going to gain? That person needed spiritual help, true, but you didn't have enough capacity to illumine him. So you have lost and he also has lost. But if you had waited for some time and accumulated more inner wealth — more peace, light and bliss — then, when the time came, you could have given and, at the same time, kept the residue. Then you both would gain.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to try to be more conscious is to spend more time in meditation. If you spend one hour now, then try to spend an hour and a half; then increase it to two hours. God has given us twenty-four hours a day. Out of twenty-four hours, we can spend quite a few hours in meditation. We spend much time on the telephone. God has given us aspiration, and God has also given us a mouth. But in silence we can say more; in silence we can also act more powerfully. So if we want to be conscious of our inner experiences during sleep, then we have to try to spend more time on our spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The action that makes your heart larger is good. When you do something and get inner joy, you feel that something is expanding. It is your consciousness. Like a bird you are spreading your wings. The action that enlarges your consciousness is right action. The action that binds you is wrong action. Always feel that anything that enlarges you is right and anything that binds you is wrong.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part V — Negative thoughts</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V — Negative thoughts" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Negative thoughts</h2>

<p>There are two ways to conquer negative thoughts. One way is very simple and dynamic. Each thought has power of its own. Positive thought has a power and negative thought also has a power. With positive power we build; with negative power we break. Each positive thought is creation and each negative thought is destruction.</p>
<p>We can get rid of negative thoughts with our soul's will power. During our meditation, slowly and steadily we develop will power. We feel that this will power is coming from a Source, which is God, the Absolute Infinite. We gradually learn how to have a free access to this will power. How do we get it? We have to feel that God is all Light and all Love, and that we are God's chosen children. If we feel that God is all Love, then immediately God the Love enters into us. In Love there is no negative thought; it is all positive. The moment divine Love goes away, everything is negative. But when God is within us there can be no negative thought, because God means Light. In Light there cannot be anything negative. Light means vision. Vision will never remain satisfied unless it is manifested, and will power manifests God's Vision on earth. So if we want to get rid of negative thoughts, then we should invoke God the Love. Love itself is Light. This is the positive way, using our love-power, which is will power.</p>
<p>There is also another way to conquer fear or negative thoughts. When a negative thought comes, we have to feel that it is a thief. A negative thought comes in the form of doubt, fear, jealousy, hypocrisy or meanness. We have to feel that each negative thought has come to commit a theft, to take something away from our inner life and inner wealth. But this wealth is ours; we have got it through our prayer and meditation. What do we do when we see a thief? We chase him away and we do it with utmost confidence. We do not allow the thief to stay, because we know that we are the master of the house. We are the owner of our body, vital, heart, mind and soul. So each time a negative thought comes, we have to give chase and say, "You have stolen something of mine. What right do you have to take it? It is mine, all mine." This is vigilance. We have to be totally vigilant, twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p>Sometimes people cherish negative thoughts. They get a kind of pleasure from them. They feel that fear, doubt and jealousy are necessary. They doubt God or their own spirituality. They become real philosophers. But doubting God and doubting their own existence is a stupid way of seeing the Truth. When fear or jealousy comes we have to enter into our inner domain and catch the thief. In the spiritual life when we catch a thief, what do we do? We take the thief to our soul's light to be illumined. In ordinary life, earthly life, we punish a thief by putting him into a prison cell. We feel that in this way he will change his nature and character. In the spiritual life, when a negative thought enters into us, we take it to the soul's light for transformation. Without the soul's light these negative thoughts cannot be transformed. First we have to chase them, then catch them and then take them to the proper place where they can be transformed. This is how we can conquer and transform negative thoughts.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When I become aware that my consciousness has slipped down very far, I often feel that when I try to do something to raise it again, I&#039;m not being sincere or it&#039;s just coming from the mind, or maybe I&#039;m pushing or pulling or forcing. What is the best way when you become aware that your consciousness has dropped to get it back up?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When I become aware that my consciousness has slipped down very far, I often feel that when I try to do something to raise it again, I&#039;m not being sincere or it&#039;s just coming from the mind, or maybe I&#039;m pushing or pulling or forcing. What is the best way when you become aware that your consciousness has dropped to get it back up?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is to surrender your undivine life to your divine life. When you fall down from the tree, you definitely know what has compelled you to fall down. Overnight you cannot realise God; also overnight you cannot fall to your lowest point. You have been with us four or five years, and you know how hard, how sincerely you have tried to make progress. It has taken you so many years to make this progress. Will all this go away immediately? No, it is not like that. It will go slowly, slowly, slowly. But if you do a few things very undivine, naturally your descent will be faster. But that doesn't mean that overnight you will fall to the foot of the tree. Each time you will climb down, say, one step or a few inches.</p>
<p>If you feel that you are falling, here is a way to prevent it. When you are falling down, try to remember devotedly and soulfully your best inner experience. There is not a single disciple who has not had one or two major experiences, according to his own capacity or receptivity. So immediately think of that incident. For instance, if one day I showed you tremendous compassion, love or gratitude, and you felt that if you didn't get anything else in this world, still on that one day you got something significant, then you have to bring that incident right in front of your vision. If you write it down, look at it, enter into it and become one with it, I tell you, the way you are climbing down will immediately stop. Immediately you will return to your height. Some spiritual Masters have done this when they went through barrenness; for six months they would have good meditations and then for one or two months they would not be able to meditate at all. Vivekananda used to have that problem. He had so many lofty, high realisations and meditations, and he wrote them down in a big notebook. Then he read them; immediately, he became one with those experiences and again he used to return to his own height. Then his meditations would again be very powerful.</p>
<p>So when your meditation is not profound and you feel that you are descending, try to remember a significant experience. You are drowning, but there is somebody on the shore to save you and you are raising your hand towards that person. That person is your own experience. You touch him and grab his hand, and then you are saved. He represents your own highest, your own sublime experience, which you had perhaps two or three years ago.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the ability to fight hostile forces a question of Grace?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the ability to fight hostile forces a question of Grace?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, but one has to have faith in Grace. If you think that Grace is like water, that is a mistake. You have to feel that Grace is something many times stronger than an atom bomb. Then you will have faith in Grace. The mind will tell you that God's Compassion is like the rain. So you will feel it is something weak and it won't give you confidence. But when you think of it as an atom bomb, a hydrogen bomb, then you will feel that God's omnipotent Power is working, and naturally you will be convinced.</p>
<p>God's Will does everything, provided you know what Grace is and what its capacity is. Otherwise, you will say, "If I meditate for five hours, God's Grace will descend like a drop of honey." A drop of honey will be sweet, but it will have no power in your life. You have to feel that Grace itself is omnipotent power; then only you will know that weakness can be conquered. Otherwise, it is impossible. You have to feel that God's Compassion is something infinitely stronger than the hostile force which is attacking you. Then you will see what Grace can do. Then you will see that Grace is fighting on your side most powerfully. But if you don't think that Grace is strong, then why should Grace help you to fight what is attacking you? Also, you have to have faith in the Master. If the Master says, "You are a good boy," you have to believe him. But if the mind comes in and you say, "Oh, Master is just flattering me," then you are lost.</p>

Is this a problem of the ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As long as we are in the unillumined mind, as long as we are always thinking of this and that, there will always be these ego problems. Only when the mind gets quiet and our deeper intuition comes forth can we go beyond the ego.</p>
<p>The mind constantly says, "I have done this," or "l have not done that because of so and so." There is no end to all the reasons and measurements the mind can contrive. If you wish to get a mango from a mango tree, your mind does not have to first determine how many leaves are on the tree, where its roots are, how much rain it has had and so on. You simply pick the mango from the tree and eat it. All the mental figuring in the world will not give you the fruit unless you take it directly. The mind is an obstacle in getting the fruits of fulfilment. We are so involved with the mind and the ego that we do not know how to get what we want. If a child wants something, he runs to his father and asks for it; he does not hesitate and start wondering if his father is qualified to give him what he needs. He does not care whether or not his father has a Master's degree, or if he is a carpenter, or whatever. Fortunately, the child does not use his mind to such an extent. He runs to his father, the source, without doubt and without mental hesitation. In this way he gets what he wants.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A selfish demand is made by the vital. If the vital demands something, you want to get it by hook or by crook. If someone does not give you what you want, you will strike that person. But if it is the inner cry, you will try only to do the right thing and please your Inner Pilot in His own way. But vital demand says, "I need something, and if you don't give it to me, then I will break your head."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I remain silent, then you have to feel that I am inwardly working on the problem. I feel that if I work on it inwardly my help will be more effective. Or I may say to you, "You are being narrow-minded; it is your jealousy that is instigating you to complain." In either case, please feel that I am working on the problem in the manner that is most effective.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between complacency and non-attachment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between complacency and non-attachment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are the son of a multimillionaire, everything is at your command because you have money-power. You are complacent, because the things that others will try for years to achieve, you will accomplish in a day. Only inner satisfaction will not be there.</p>
<p>Non-attachment is something totally different. There you fulfil God's Will and get joy while fulfilling His Will. You do not remain in the vital world, attached to the results. Let us say that it is God's Will that you submit an article to <em>The New York Times.</em> If they don't print it and you are attached, then you will get angry. If you are attached to the idea of success and not to God's Will, then you will curse the spiritual Master who asked you to submit it. "Why did he ask me to submit it? Now I have failed." But if you are not attached, then you will get the greatest joy whether you succeed or fail.</p>
<p>Non-attachment is not indifference. When you are indifferent, you don't look at a person. You are walking along the street and somebody is dying of thirst, but you will not look at him. If you are non-attached, your inner being will compel you to give him a glass of water. But if he doesn't drink it, you will not feel sad or angry. Your inner being may tell you to wait half an hour to see what he will do, but you will not curse him or curse yourself because he is so ungrateful and you have wasted your time. You are only an instrument, so you are not attached to the result.</p>
<p>Attachment comes when you are motivated by your vital. If your vital desires something, then you feel that you need that thing. When you need something, you want to get it in your own way. But non-attachment tells you that you are doing it for somebody else, for your real Self. If you surrender the unreal in you to the Real in you, then you will not be motivated by your individual will and you will not be attached in any way. Only you will be one with God's Will twenty-four hours a day. Do not mistake indifference for non-attachment. Do everything devotedly and unconditionally, and then place it at the Feet of the Supreme. Otherwise, if you take indifference as non-attachment, you will not do anything; you will only say that you are not attached.</p>

 <p>
SE 40-50. On 1 June 1973, Sri Chinmoy was interviewed on radio station KPFA in Berkeley, California.</p>
<h2>Question: I would like to ask you about the meaning of the goal of attaining inseparable oneness with God. I know that T.S. Eliot has said that at the end of all our journeying we will arrive at the place where we began, only to recognise it for the first time. Is this at all analogous to achieving total enlightenment?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is practically the same thing. We go back to the Source. But we have to know that there is no end to our realisation of the Source. The Source is right now the Beyond, but we have to come to realise that this Beyond is the ever-transcending Beyond; it is not a final goal.</p>
<p>There is an inner urge in the human in us, as well as in the divine in us, to transcend itself. As there is no end to our human desires, so also there is no end to our divine realisation. The Beyond is the Goal right now, but when we reach the Beyond we feel that this Goal can be transcended. God Himself is transcending Himself at every moment. He is Omnipotent, He is Omniscient, He is Omnipresent; but He Himself is always transcending his own Realisation and Perfection.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Total, inseparable oneness with God is one thing and the manifestation of that inseparable oneness on earth is another thing. When someone realises God, he and God become consciously inseparable. But that is not the end of the game. He has to manifest God; he and God have to consciously play together. Before realisation he was an unconscious instrument of God. Now he has to become a constant, conscious instrument of God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have to be very frank with you. In my case I had this realisation or self-discovery in a previous incarnation. I carried it with me to this incarnation. Once upon a time I studied the book and knew it perfectly. But in this incarnation it took me twenty years, from the age of twelve right up to thirty-two, to revise the old book.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To an unaspiring person, the flickering of the eyes looks like a restless movement. But for the sincere seekers, this movement of the eyes will be a different matter altogether. There are seven higher planes of consciousness. Since I am a spiritual man and at the same time I am in a meditative consciousness, I am flying from one plane of consciousness to another. I am acting like a divine bird, flying from one branch to another. When my eyes move, I enter into one plane of consciousness and the treasure of that consciousness enters into my being; then I reveal this treasure through my eyes. While I am entering into another plane of consciousness, I acquire and reveal the wealth of that plane of consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to accept the world, but we have to know if the world that we are accepting is accepting us or not. We have to know if the world at large is ready to give us the opportunity to be of service to it. At the same time, we have to know whether we have the capacity and the willingness to transform the face of the world.</p>
<p>Both the outer method and the inner method of bringing about peace are effective. At the United Nations they are using the outer methods, political means; I am using the inner method. I go there twice a week and hold meditations. At that time we invoke peace and the presence of God from above. In our human life, the outer life and the inner life have to go together. We cannot ignore the outer life. If we ignore the outer life, then we will remain imperfect. And if we ignore the inner life, then we will have nothing to offer. So in my philosophy I feel that we have to accept the world. The outer life and the inner life must run side by side.</p>
