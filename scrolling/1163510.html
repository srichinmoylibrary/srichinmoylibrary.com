 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can I best acquire the qualities of the heart?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can feel that you are five years old or seven years old, then you will remain pure, sincere and dedicated. But if you think that you are twenty-three or twenty-eight, then you will have to struggle with your mind. Just feel that you are five years old and you are playing in a garden. Let others think that you are a silly person; no harm.</p>
<p>So our path is the path of acceptance. The child accepts everything that he sees around him. He tries to accept everything and grasp everything. If you can sincerely feel that you are a child, if you can have a childlike heart, then you are going to make the fastest progress. But this feeling has to be spontaneous.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way to cultivate this feeling is to mix with others who have a childlike heart. Birds of a feather flock together. A thief will make friends with other thieves and a saint will make friends with spiritual people. If you want to mix with children, but they see that you are all impurity or insincerity, then why will they mix with you? You have to dive deep within and get in touch with the inner garden; then you become another child. If you have become a child, other children will have no objection to mixing with you. They will feel that there is no yawning gulf between your existence and God's Existence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is concern?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is concern?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Concern is a most complicated word. Sometimes we say that we have concern about someone, but it may not be real concern. It is concern when you are offering something for the sake of love, for the sake of God, when you are showing oneness with mankind. If God is the bridge between two individuals, then God must unite the two of you. Then it is real concern. If God unites an individual to the world at large then there is concern. But if God is out of the picture when you want to do something for somebody, then it is all attachment, because one is trying to possess the other.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, indeed. That is absolutely necessary. A child knows that the mother will not intentionally do anything to harm him. The child believes that even unconsciously the mother will not do anything wrong. For her to harm him consciously is out of the question. The child will never think that the mother will do something wrong consciously, far from it. On the contrary, the child has implicit faith in the mother. He feels that if someone gives poison, the mother herself will drink the poison and save her child. This same faith is needed by a mature person, someone with a developed mind.</p>
<p>After a child becomes thirteen, the mind starts functioning. Whether it is the intellectual mind or the ordinary mind, the mind has its own way of doubting, suspecting and doing all kinds of undivine things. So the best thing is to think that you are four years old, even if you are very mature, very developed in the spiritual life. If you think that you are a child, then you make the fastest progress. How can you have receptivity? A child has receptivity, immediate receptivity, because he does not rely on his own capacity. He relies on his mother's capacity. Again, he is eager to give his little capacity. His little capacity is his faith. A child's capacity is his faith that his father can lift up a heavy weight. His faith is that his father can do it and also that his father will do it for him. The very faith that he has in his father will save him. His faith in his father is his faith in himself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can best love and help others provided we feel that we are all one. When one part of my body suffers, on the strength of oneness another part comes to the fore and tries to help the one that needs help. If we can love God the root, then we can love God the seed, God the root, God the tree, God the flower and God the leaves. If a seeker feels that he and others are one, then only God is guiding him and guiding others.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can easily know whether or not the work we do is a selfless, dedicated service just by entering into the heart while we are working. If the heart is expanding, if the heart is being illumined, if the heart is running like a deer towards the Goal, then it is certainly dedicated service.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does oneness help us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does oneness help us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you remain in the highest consciousness, totally identified with me, then on the strength of your identification and your oneness with me, you have all the capacities. But when the connection is cut off and oneness is not complete, at that time you belong to yourself. You maintain your own individuality and personality. Because of that limited individuality and personality, you cannot manifest the capacity within you.</p>
<p>At the highest level, there is no examination; reality in its entirety is there. But when you are even one rung below the highest, you feel that a kind of examination starts, because with limited capacities you are trying to accomplish the unlimited. That is why a kind of examination is going on. Again, when you are in the highest, at that time everything is unlimited. You claim the highest as your own, so there is no test. The Infinite remains with the Infinite. There is no incapacity as such in the highest. It is complete. In my highest, I am absolutely complete. When I am absolutely in the Highest itself, then Eternity, Infinity and Immortality are not vague terms; they are reality, absolute reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In this case you established your own oneness with the Source in him. On the outer plane he was playing; on the inner plane the soul was playing in and through you. You were entering into that particular musician; he was entering into the Source. From there the music was being played. It happens quite a few times when a seeker in the audience enters into the Source. The seeker who is in the audience can easily establish his oneness with the Source if he feels that he is being utilised by the Source. One is active; the other one is silent. The one that is playing is active and you at that time are silent. You are not merely a silent listener, but a silent participant.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have security and humility at the same time?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have security and humility at the same time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the ordinary life, unaspiring life, there is no such thing as security. Nobody can be secure in his own life or in the lives of others. No matter how powerful, how rich or how wise he is, he will not feel totally secure. Why? Precisely because he has not established, he cannot establish oneness with another individual. There cannot be total oneness, constant, eternal and inseparable oneness unless and until one has established oneness with the Supreme. Here on earth when we want to establish security in our own capacities and talents, we come to realise that it is impossible. Then we become a perfect slave to someone else in order to gain security. But we have to know that the Supreme has all security. If we go deep within, then we will be able to feel secure in our Source. When we pray to the Supreme or meditate on the Supreme, we do not have to pray for security, but for constant and conscious oneness.</p>
<p>Humility is not touching the dust of somebody's feet. Humility automatically comes. The higher you climb, the more humble you become. In the spiritual life, if a real spiritual Master has something to offer, he becomes humble like a tree bearing fruit. If someone has nothing to offer, then he becomes haughty and arrogant. But if the Master knows that he has something, then he offers that very existence to humanity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is sincerity in the mind and vital the same for all seekers, or is it different for each individual?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is sincerity in the mind and vital the same for all seekers, or is it different for each individual?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the degree of advancement of the seeker. A child's sincerity, a young man's sincerity and an elderly person's sincerity in the physical, the vital and the mind need not be the same. If a child has done something wrong, then he will tell the whole story from beginning to end. If a grown-up or an adolescent has done something wrong, then he is more reticent. He may say only a few words about the thing that he has done. And a forty or fifty-year-old person will only say, "Oh, I made a mistake." That will be the length of his sincerity. So sincerity is expressed by three individuals in three different ways. The child, if he is sincere, will tell the whole story, how it started and how it ended. The adolescent will tell only a few lines and then stop. And a fifty or sixty-year-old person won't even name the incident. He will just say that he made a mistake.</p>
<p>When it is a matter of recognising insincerity, a child may not even know if at times he is a bad child. A grown-up person will know what sincerity is and what insincerity is, but he may not appreciate that he is telling the truth. Sometimes an elderly person will tell the same lie ten times in order to prove that he is sincere. If a person tells one lie, then he has to be prepared to tell ten more lies to save the first lie. Many people are prepared to tell ten more lies or repeatedly to tell the same lie. They collect the negative force and offer it to the first lie. Then they are convinced that they are telling the truth. Many times they know that they have told a lie, but they just go on, After they have said the same thing twenty times, then it does not remain a lie to them any more; it becomes absolutely gospel. They are so accustomed to saying it that it has become part and parcel of their life. To them insincerity has become sincerity, but others can trace it as insincerity.</p>
<p>Again, sometimes sincerity itself is challenged by human beings. You have seen something or done something; but if ten persons did not also see it, then you enter into the doubting human mind. Although you know that you have done a good thing or a bad thing, there comes a time when you doubt yourself and you feel that you could not have done it. You feel that somebody else has done it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is purity? Purity is something that makes us feel that God can never be separated from our true existence. If one has purity, then one can feel God as his very own. And if one does not have purity, then one can never feel God as his own; he is only fooling himself. A man of impurity can never, never claim God, with utmost sincerity, as his very own.</p>
<p>So, if somebody has purity in abundant measure, then only will he be able to claim God as his very own and at the same time be convinced of his inner commitment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how can I have more purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how can I have more purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Look at a flower early in the morning and smell its fragrance. Look at the flower and immediately feel how pure the flower is. Then look straight at the morning sun, the early rising sun. How beautiful it is! Do you see anything impure in it? No. Look at the moon. Do you see anything impure? Look at anything which gives you the feeling of purity. Look at a candle flame and you will see that it is all pure; it is burning away all your impurities. Anything that you feel is outwardly pure, keep that thing right in front of your mental vision. This is one way, the easiest way to convince the mind.</p>
<p>The other way involves breathing. When you meditate, try to breathe in as slowly as possible. Quietly and slowly breathe in and feel that with each breath you are bringing into your system peace, light and bliss. These qualities are nothing but purity itself. Then, when you breathe out, feel that you are breathing out all the ignorance and imperfection inside you. Through conscious breathing you can bring purity into your system; and each time you breathe out, throw out impurity.</p>
<p>You can practise both methods. Keep a flower, incense and anything else that symbolises purity in your outer mind in front of your outer vision. Then, when you can go deep within, you will not need a flower, candle or incense.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can sustain purity if we can consciously feel that there is a rose inside our heart blossoming petal by petal. Always we have to see the living image of a flower, let us say a rose or a lotus. The moment we see a flower, consciously or unconsciously we breathe in the purity of that flower. If we feel that a rose is blossoming petal by petal from within, then naturally the fragrance and purity of the rose will permeate our whole inner and outer existence. Or, if we wish, we can try to see a candle flame within our heart. The candle flame is constantly climbing up high, higher, highest. While it is climbing, it is illumining our ignorant, obscure, impure and undivine existence. So in this way we can sustain our purity and have abiding satisfaction in our life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the relationship between aspiration and purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the relationship between aspiration and purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you say that you have to become totally pure before you can aspire, then I say that that day will never dawn. If you have to become one hundred per cent pure and chaste, then you will have to wait for Eternity. It is true that one has to be purified to some extent; otherwise when the Divine Power enters into us then everything is spoiled. It creates more confusion than joy. There can be no Creation, divine Creation. But aspiration and purification must go together. If you aspire, then you will have purification in your own nature; and if you have purification in your own nature, then your aspiration will be more intense, it will reach the peak. So, nobody is perfect. Nobody can dare to say that after his nature's perfection he will start meditating. What is the use of meditation and concentration if he is already perfect? Chastity and purity come only from inner aspiration; they have to go side by side. One complements the other; one fulfils the other.</p>
