 <p>
SCA 1013-1024. Sri Chinmoy answered these questions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 18 December 1999.</p>
<h2>Question: How can I find the quality of enthusiasm more appealing?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to use your imagination. Think of something sweet, either honey or something else. Or you can think of divine nectar, which is definitely sweet and immortal. Let us say that you want to taste something sweet in your own life — in your soul, heart, mind, vital and body. Now, if you lick your finger, there is no sweetness. If you taste any part of your body, you will not get sweetness. But you can take enthusiasm as sweetness in your life. You definitely like sweet things, whether it is sugar or honey or something else. There is nobody who can say they do not like sweet things at all. That is absurd.</p>
<p>Take enthusiasm as something very, very sweet and imagine that you are enjoying that sweetness. Never take enthusiasm as something that you cannot enjoy or that is out of your reach. No, no! When you think of enthusiasm, use the word 'sweetness' instead of 'enthusiasm'. Either your heart will enjoy the sweetness, your mind will enjoy the sweetness, your vital will enjoy the sweetness or your body will enjoy the sweetness. You are bound to increase your enthusiasm if you replace the word 'enthusiasm' with 'sweetness'. While you are looking at a flower, if you feel that you are getting sweetness, then that sweetness will give you enthusiasm.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of the sun and think of yourself as a pilgrim who is either running or flying towards the sun. Or you can imagine a sun inside you that is extremely, extremely beautiful — infinitely more beautiful and more powerful than the outer sun. Feel that as a pilgrim, you are running as fast as possible, and the faster you are running, the more beauty, the more power, the more light, the more affection, the more love, the more fondness you are seeing in the inner sun. The faster you are running towards the sun, the more its own divine qualities are increasing, and at the same time they are beckoning you. The inner sun has all these divine qualities: love, affection, sweetness, fondness, concern and so on. If you can see yourself as a pilgrim running towards the sun, you will be able to make the fastest progress. When you look at the morning sun, darkness disappears. At first the sun may be covered by clouds, but then it emerges from the clouds. Similarly, our human nature — our whole existence — has to come out of darkness. Then only can we make the fastest progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Where is determination to be found? In which part of our being do we have to work on determination? Is it in the mind or the heart?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Where is determination to be found? In which part of our being do we have to work on determination? Is it in the mind or the heart?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Determination can be found inside the mind. With determination, you can try to do many things. You can have the determination that says: "I will do something good. I will do something great. All bad things I will give up." But at any moment the determination that comes from the mind can be challenged by doubt, specially self-doubt. Then our determination is destroyed.</p>
<p>If you want to become a good person, a great person, or if you want to do something great, there is another way. That is the way of oneness. If you can identify yourself with something very strong, very powerful and very vast, then inside your oneness you will find all the positive qualities. When you use determination or will-power, you are entering into someone or something. Like a dagger, you are piercing into something. But the way of oneness is to just throw yourself into the vastness. I always say that when a drop enters into the ocean, it becomes infinite, boundless — that drop you will no longer see.</p>
<p>Problems can be solved permanently only by identifying yourself with something very strong, very powerful, very vast. Look at the sky. How much vastness it has! Look at the ocean. How much power it has! Just throw yourself into the vastness or into the power. This is the wisest way and this way is also permanent.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Among the spiritual qualities, you very rarely speak about loyalty. Is it something you value?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Among the spiritual qualities, you very rarely speak about loyalty. Is it something you value?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Loyalty is bound to come if there is obedience. If I tell you, "Do this," then if you are obedient, loyalty is automatically there. What else is loyalty, if not obedience? When a servant is loyal to his master, it means he is obedient. If the master says, "Go and do this for me," he immediately goes. But obedience is something infinitely deeper than loyalty. When you obey your spiritual Master or when you obey your boss, at that time there is a feeling of oneness. You love your Master or you have respect or admiration for your boss. Your obedience is bringing you closer and closer. But when you are merely loyal to someone, at that time there is a kind of separativity. When I am loyal to a person, that means I will not deceive him, I will not betray him. But there is a sense of separation. Somebody is great, and I am inferior to him. That is why I am loyal. But when there is obedience, in between you and the other person there is love. I love my Master; my Master loves me. Therefore he commands me, and I obey him.</p>
<p>Obedience is infinitely more important than loyalty. Again, if one has obedience, it will house loyalty. The Master will not tell his disciples, "Do not be loyal to me." It is understood. If I love my Master, if I obey my Master, then how can I be disloyal to him? Immediately my heart will break. If I am going to betray him even for a second, my heart will bleed. It is because of my obedience that I cannot go this side, I cannot go that side. I feel that my freedom is inside my obedience. Obedience houses freedom. And if you have freedom inside your obedience, then you are bound to be loyal.</p>
<p>Loyalty is very, very inferior in comparison to obedience. In the outer life, a servant may be very loyal to his master or a worker may be very loyal to his boss. But obedience is like the ocean — it will absolutely engulf everything. If you are obedient, then you are bound to be loyal. Loyalty is on the physical level or, you can say, the practical level, while obedience is on a much higher level. Obedience immediately brings oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a colour for bliss and, if so, can you describe it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a colour for bliss and, if so, can you describe it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The colour for bliss can be any colour that gives you joy. If you like green, then for you green represents bliss. If I like blue, for me blue is the colour for bliss. If somebody else likes red, then for that person, red is the colour for bliss. Any colour that satisfies you can represent bliss.</p>
<p>Again, this colour may change. The cosmic gods and goddesses embody bliss. On the highest plane, their light is one colour. When the same light is touching the earth realm, it becomes another colour totally. Both of these colours can give us joy.</p>
<p>Let us take Mother Kali, for example. Mother Kali is the Mother of Compassion. When you see her in the highest plane, her whole being is golden. But when she descends into darkness and fights with the impure vital of the world, she is so ferocious. She carries a scimitar in her right hand and wears a garland of heads. She absolutely destroys everything. When a seeker's consciousness goes to the highest plane, he sees that the colour of Mother Kali's light is golden, and it gives him such joy. Again, on the lower plane, when the colour becomes red, the seeker can get so much strength. He feels, "My Mother Kali is killing all the hostile forces only for me, to save me, to protect me. She loves me so much!" It is the same light, but on one plane it is golden and on another plane it is red.</p>
<p>Similarly, the experience of bliss is according to our inner height. This moment if I go very high — to the top of the tree, where I can eat mangoes to my heart's content — then I am in bliss. Next moment if I very confidently stay at the foot of the tree, I am also in bliss. So bliss depends on the consciousness we embody at each moment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we cannot be with you at special and sacred times and we hear afterwards it was something that should not have been missed, something very important, how can we not feel sad that we had to miss it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we cannot be with you at special and sacred times and we hear afterwards it was something that should not have been missed, something very important, how can we not feel sad that we had to miss it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you know I am having a seven-hour meditation or I have lifted 700 pounds, if something very significant has taken place in New York and you are in Switzerland or Hungary or some other place, then if you feel miserable that you were not there, that you could not participate, you get zero. When you hear that I have achieved something or something great has happened, immediately say, "<em>My</em> Guru has done it!" Then if you get sincere joy and if your joy is absolutely one with my achievement, you are bound to feel that you have done it. If you are sincerely happy, immediately my achievement belongs to you.</p>
<p>A child is sincerely happy when his father buys a car. He claims it as his own. He tells his friends, "This is my car." His father will not say, "When did you have the money to buy a car? It is all my money." No. His father is so happy that the child is claiming the car. The father is so pleased that his child is as happy as he is with the car or perhaps even happier.</p>
<p>In your case, suppose you are in San Francisco and I do something very significant in New York. As soon as you hear the news, either you can be happy or you can feel miserable that you were not there. If you start thinking that so and so was there — either your friends or your enemies — then your consciousness will descend. But if you can immediately say, " <em>My</em> Guru has done it!" then sooner than at once you are bound to feel that you yourself have done it.</p>
<p>There have been many, many occasions when the Supreme has done something and I have claimed that I have done it because of my oneness. I love the Supreme so much. When He tells me in the occult world that something has happened, my joy is such that I immediately feel that I have done it. I have had nothing to do with it outwardly, but my oneness with Him is such that I am there. He is the ocean and I am a drop. How can we be separated? If I claim myself to be a drop, then I belong to the ocean. So if you are sincerely happy on the strength of your oneness with my achievement, then you can receive much more than those who were there to see it.</p>
<p>Recently I celebrated my brother's birthday with a special weightlifting demonstration. There quite a few disciples were tired and exhausted. Some were sleeping. Some were in another world — they were unhappy, miserable. If you watch the video, you will see how I was killing myself to lift such heavy weights and some of the disciples were looking so bored. Some of the guests who were not disciples were receiving much more than my disciples! I was so shocked when I saw the video. While performing, I could not see the audience. Then afterwards, when I saw the video, I said, "Some of my disciples are like lifeless wood, while some of the guests are like most beautiful flowers." You cannot imagine to what extent some of the guests became one with me on that night! They were so eager to watch my performance.</p>
<p>All the disciples around the world take me as their spiritual father. If they really love their father, then when their father does something, will they not be happy? Wherever there is happiness, we make progress. Otherwise, by saying, "Oh, Guru did something, but I was not there to witness it," you are only bringing in a sense of separation between you and me. The best disciples are those who are happy. They may be in another part of the world, but they may be receiving much more than those who are right near me. Perhaps those who were near were not in a high consciousness. If their consciousness is lower than the lowest, are they going to receive anything? Whoever is happy at my achievement establishes his oneness with me and receives much more.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I increase my dynamism?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I increase my dynamism?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To increase your dynamism, meditate on flames. You can look at a candle flame or any other type of flame. Flames embody dynamism. If you look at a flame or imagine a flame, your lethargy will go away. Fire will burn all our lethargy or lack of enthusiasm. Anything that is undivine in us, fire will burn. If fire burns our lethargy, then automatically dynamism will come to the fore.</p>
<p>Fire has dynamism. That is why it keeps everything under control. Everything surrenders to fire. So always imagine flames or fire. If you imagine fire, you may think more of destruction than dynamism, but if you think of flames, climbing flames, then destruction will not come into your mind. Flames take us upward. How can we go upward without becoming dynamic? If I want to climb a tree, if I want to climb a mountain, then I have to be dynamic. Flames show us the way. They are going up, up, up and touching the sky. So, to increase your dynamism, look at flames. That is the easiest and most effective way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To make the fastest progress, you must forget the past. Do not dwell on your past failures or past imperfections even for a second. You have to feel that you do not have a past with imperfections, defeats or any kind of discouraging negativity. Feel that you were just born; you are just a little baby; you are now only a few hours old. Do not think that you are even one year old. Or look at a flower that has just begun to bloom. See that it will blossom petal by petal and soon it will become a most beautiful flower.</p>
<p>Another way is to see yourself as the dawn. Imagine the sun rising little by little. When we look at the sun, we never think of yesterday's sun. We never think of the day before yesterday's sun or the sun that rose before us two years ago. We just watch the sun climbing higher and higher, giving its light. We do not see the past of the sun. We just see that, like a little baby, the sun is taking birth, becoming bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Always feel that you have just been born. Then you will make the fastest progress. A little baby is always making progress — he is crawling, he is standing up, he is walking, he is marching, he is running. Never think of the past — your past failures, past defeats or past imperfections. Feel that the past does not exist. Feel that only today, here and now, exists in your life. Do not carry anything with you from the past — whether it is good or bad. If you can sincerely feel that you have just been born, that you are only a few hours old, and that you are on the Lap of the Supreme, that He is responsible for you, you can make the fastest progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: We know that it is very important to have affection between you and us and between God and us, but among your disciples, is there a role for affection? Is it important to feel affection for one another?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: We know that it is very important to have affection between you and us and between God and us, but among your disciples, is there a role for affection? Is it important to feel affection for one another?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Affection as such is not bad. Affection is sweeter than the sweetest, but unfortunately, right next door to affection is attachment. Affection and attachment are only separated by a wall, and even that wall has a side door. You have to always keep the door between affection and attachment locked from both sides. Many times affection is sweet, sweeter, sweetest. If you bring forward your affection, you can make tremendous progress. But after some time, affection may become attachment. Then, inside attachment, the problem starts. All kinds of emotional demands come forward: "I have been so kind to you, so why did you do something to displease me?" or "Why did you not include me when you were doing something?"</p>
<p>A mother is full of affection for her child. When the child does something on his own, if the mother uses her affection, then the mother will be very, very happy. But if the mother uses her attachment, the mother will say, "Why did you not involve me? Why did you not tell me? How could you do it without my knowledge?" Inside attachment there is expectation and demand, whereas affection will only say, "My child has done this? I am so happy, so happy!"</p>
<p>We have to keep affection and attachment separate. Affection is absolutely necessary — it is sweet, sweeter, sweetest. But if attachment comes, then we only create problems for ourselves. I am so fond of my dog. When I have to go to the United Nations or somewhere else, if I am attached to my dog, then I will try to take him with me. Then the dog will create problems. Exactly the same way, when I am attached to someone, I will try by force to keep that person with me. But affection will say, "Now I am needed somewhere. Please remain here." Affection has wisdom in it, but attachment does not. So affection is very, very good, but you have to keep attachment out of it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do Avatars have to suffer so much?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do Avatars have to suffer so much?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The higher you go, the more you care for the world. The higher you go, the more you have to suffer, because you become one with God. On the one hand, God is beyond all suffering. On the other hand, God suffers infinitely more than His creation. When a child is sick, his mother's whole world collapses. But when the mother falls sick, the child goes and plays football. The mother will give up everything because her child is sick. But if the mother has the same sickness, what can the child do? When a child cries, his mother wants to take it on herself. But when the mother has a stomach upset or headache, the child will feel bad for one minute, and then he will go out to play.</p>
<p>Avatars have to prove that they love God the creation. When we realise God, first we realise God the Creator. Then inside God the Creator, we see God the creation. First we go up, and then we see that up includes all around. At that time we become one with both God the Creator and the creation. Now if the Creator does not care for the creation, who will care? The higher one goes, the more one identifies with God the Creator, the more responsibility one has to take.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters want to remain only on the top of the tree. There they are ready with the most delicious fruit. They say, "You come. I am ready for you. I have the fruits." This is the Father aspect of God. The Father aspect is very strict. The Father aspect says, "You have to learn how to climb up the tree. Then only will I give you the fruits." But the Mother aspect is not like that. Even if the child is strong, even if he knows how to climb, the Mother will come down and give the fruits to the child.</p>
<p>The Father aspect is like the entire cow, while the Mother aspect is like the udder, where the milk comes. The Mother will immediately bring the child and say, "This is the place where you will get the milk." The Father aspect will say, "You have to search for the place where the milk is." Then you will go and look at the foot, at the ear or at the head. You will find that there is no milk there. When an Avatar takes the aspect of God the Mother, that is the time when everything falls on his back. But when he takes the aspect of God the Father, he says to the seekers, "Take your own time."</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Mother aspect is slow and steady. The Mother aspect says, "Oh, my child is so weak. Let him take his time." The Father aspect will say, "No. Be strict, be strict, be strict." But the Mother has another aspect, which embodies intensity, intimacy and affection. The Mother wants the child to crawl, to march, to run as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Why do the Avatars have to suffer so much? Because God loves the Avatars. Whoever is loved by someone immediately gets responsibility, whether willingly or unwillingly, whether consciously or unconsciously. Immediately the Avatars feel, "We are responsible." Ordinary people will say, "No, we are not responsible." Again, God does not make anybody indispensable. It is one thing to be responsible and another thing to be indispensable. You may be responsible for doing something. But if you do not do it, do not think you are indispensable.</p>
<p>If someone declares himself to be a spiritual Master and if God also declares in and through certain human beings that that person is a spiritual Master, then that person has to play his role. How can one be a spiritual Master if one does not carry the burden of the world? Whose wisdom, whose oneness with God is more genuine or more established than a spiritual Master's? The higher we go, the more responsibility we have to take. Then, when we take more responsibility, God says, "Do not think that you are indispensable." Sometimes when a spiritual Master takes responsibility, he may feel that he is indispensable, since he is taking care of thousands of disciples. If anyone feels that he is indispensable, God laughs.</p>
<p>Before the Christ, the world existed. Before Sri Krishna, the world existed. Before anybody, the world existed. But when a spiritual Master takes responsibility happily and cheerfully, God says, "You are one with Me. I am carrying a heavy burden. Now you carry as much of that burden as you can." But the moment responsibility becomes proud or haughty — "I am responsible and I am proud that I am responsible" — then comes, "I am indispensable." God can work only in and through individuals who always think that they are not indispensable. They make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>The boss in a factory feels he is indispensable. The boss in a bank feels he is indispensable. The boss in a supermarket feels he is indispensable. But let any of them die today. Then somebody else will come to take his place. Spiritual people, if they are conscious, take responsibility as a blessing. They say, "Because I can take care of hundreds of people, God will be so pleased. He will ask me to take care of 2,000 people, then 5,000 people. He will ask me to take care of the whole world." In that way, taking responsibility is very good. But when we have the feeling of pride — without me, the bank will not function, the factory will not function or the office will not function — then it will be our spiritual downfall. Spiritual Masters take responsibility, but then they are very, very careful. They must not say, "Because I exist, my centre or my mission exists." That is a joke. God laughs.</p>
<p>The higher we go, the more we have to suffer, but again the more joy we feel. Perhaps God has given me the capacity to be of service to 4,000 or 5,000 people. The more I can serve, the more I can get joy.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, a spiritual Master's suffering is absolutely real. But again, in my case, when I suffer, I see that I have taken the suffering in the right way. When I see that my Supreme is very happy because I have taken my suffering with the right attitude, then I get boundless joy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, by not doing the same wrong thing again. It is the wrong forces that have entered into the disciples that create suffering for the spiritual Master. If the disciples want to undo the suffering, they should not allow those wrong forces to enter into them again.</p>
<p>Let us say that today you have struck someone. Tomorrow if you do not strike that person, then again he will get his strength back. When the disciples do the wrong thing, it is like somebody has struck me. I suffer. But God is constantly supplying me with new light, new vision, new energy, new divine qualities. Then, if I am not struck by darkness, will I not maintain these divine qualities? God is like an ever-new supply — a river running towards the ocean, murmuring. If you place a dam or some obstruction there, then the river is stopped. Again, if you remove it, the river once again starts flowing towards the ocean. If the disciples do not repeat the wrong action, then the Master will not suffer.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If all of us could be sincerely happy, would all your problems be over?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If all of us could be sincerely happy, would all your problems be over?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Happiness is of different types. Sometimes we call something happiness, but it is not happiness; it is pleasure. We have so much difficulty separating them. In the morning you are supposed to get up at six o'clock to meditate. Now suppose you get up at six o'clock, and then you start looking at the sunrise. By looking at the sunrise you become so happy. You think, "I am so happy. Now Guru should be happy." But you are actually enjoying pleasure-life. At six o'clock you are supposed to pray and meditate. If you had gotten up and prayed and meditated, that happiness would have really helped me. But instead, you found your so-called happiness in pleasure.</p>
<p>Then perhaps you want to sleep five minutes more, ten minutes more, half an hour more. By establishing friendship with your lethargy, you feel that you are getting joy. But you do not realise that you are only enjoying pleasure-life. In a clever way you are feeding your lethargy, and you are saying you are so happy. You have gone farther than the farthest away from me. I want you to get up at six o'clock and pray and meditate. That happiness would have really helped me, because you would have become one with my will. Instead you are becoming happy by feeding your lethargy. You get up two hours late, and then you feel that you are so happy. If I see that you are losing your inner capacity, will I be happy?</p>
<p>So you see how clever human beings can be. Your pleasure-life you are identifying with your real happiness-life. True happiness-life can only be found in your oneness with the will of your Master. It is very difficult to separate pleasure-life from true innocent happiness. Your innocent happiness definitely helps me. Good disciples come to me with pure happiness, innocent happiness. Some good disciples come to me like a flower that has blossomed. Others come with forced happiness. In their minds they are thinking, "Guru will be displeased if I do not show him a happiness-face." That happiness is not helping me at all.</p>
<p>Like an arrow, you are piercing me when you are not sincerely happy. Again, when good disciples come to me with an innocent, sweet smile, they are definitely helping me. Some are coming with happiness only in their mind, while some are coming with an open heart. Then do I not see the difference? In the line some are giving me so much joy, while some are giving me so much pain. Next to you somebody may be coming who is only giving me a false smile. But if anybody gives me a true smile, it takes away so much of my suffering. Your smile is the only thing that helps me. At that time you are not adding anything to my problems. On the contrary, you are sharing my suffering through your happiness.</p>
<p>To come back to your question, we must always separate pleasure from happiness. Very easily you can distinguish between the two if you are sincere, if you are strict with yourself. Otherwise, so many times pleasure-life is taking the place of our innocent happiness.</p>
