<p>She was in love with a married man. She felt, “If only he would give up his wife and try to please me! But if I keep my Master between my existence and his existence, then I will never get him. In order to get him, please him, placate him, I must give up the Master. I don’t want the Master to stand between us. There was a time when I used to think the Master was a bridge; now I think the Master is a wall, a solid wall.”</p>

<p>“My friend has been through married life. He knows who can please him. His first wife did not please him because she was anything but divine, but in me he has found his true partner. That means he and I will really be happy. But the Master won’t allow us to become one. The Master feels that there can be no happiness based on human love. Why did God give us the human body if human love is meaningless and useless?</p>
<p>“And I curse the Master because he has brainwashed my future husband and made him feel that only God satisfies mankind and not any human being. I don’t need his path. I wanted to please him in his own way always. I am glad that I did not please him in his own way. If I had done that, today I would really have become crazy. I want to retain the little sanity that I have.”</p>
<p>This is what this young woman thought, and she left the Master.</p>

<p>“My first husband left me because I was an idiot, unreliable. The present one left the path and left me because he felt that his daughters from a previous marriage were more affectionate to him than I. Since the Master does not or cannot please me by keeping my husband faithful only to me, it is better to look for another path.”</p>

<p>The day was fixed for him to get his spiritual name. He felt miserable, because getting a spiritual name meant he had to lead a pure life. He felt that his impure life was giving him so much satisfaction. “Why get a spiritual name and destroy my impurity-satisfaction life?”</p>

<p>He stayed with his Master for six months. During these six months he did not notice any occult power in the Master. He thought that if the Master had occult power, naturally he would have displayed it during the six months. He was told that there were certain spiritual Masters who showed their occult power to disciples the very day they were accepted by their Master.</p>
<p>“Either this Master does not have occult power or he does not want to show it to me. Most probably he does not have it. A Master without occult power is no Master.”</p>

<p>He became famous, very famous, on his island. He felt that he did not need his Master’s blessings. Without the Master he could easily live on earth.</p>
<p>His wife had severe headaches and every morning she had to pray to the Master to free her from pain. The Master used to cure her only when she prayed to him. Finally she said to herself, “What kind of Master is this if I have to pray to him every day to free me from my headache? He has no compassion for me.” Therefore, she left.</p>

<p>His wife left the Master because the spiritual name that the Master gave their daughter was not at all pleasing. She thought that if she stayed with the Master, she would be compelled to call the child by the Indian spiritual name. She felt that it was too much for her, so she left.</p>

<p>She had a huge apartment, a big loft, and once the Master went there with a group of disciples. She was a great artist and the Master appreciated her art tremendously. One day she said to the Master, “How is it that I can’t earn a living from my painting, although I am a great artist?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “For that, one thing is necessary: purity — a pure life, a life of purity. ”</p>
<p>That was the day the disciple thought of leaving the Master. In a few weeks’ time, she left.</p>

<p>She was the Master’s first official secretary. She was extremely devoted to the Master while she was with him. However, she had two problems. First, her daughter failed to live a pure life, to say the least. She created many problems in the school where she studied, near Poughkeepsie. The Master did help the girl considerably in coming out of her vital life, but that was not enough for her mother. The mother wanted a radical transformation in her daughter. Also, she wanted the Master to use a special power so that her French husband would not beat her when he was drunk. Since the Master could not succeed totally in solving either of these two problems — the one with her husband and the one with her daughter — she disappeared.</p>

<p>She ran a church and had quite a few disciples. Once she invited the Master to come and give a talk to the disciples. But then she saw that if her disciples met the Master, they would all leave her. So she asked the Master to bless her privately and she told her disciples that the Master was sick and had cancelled the meeting.</p>
<p>Eventually she came to realise that if she kept this man as her Master, sooner or later she would be compelled to take her disciples to see him and then she would lose all of them. She didn’t want to do that, so she gave up the Master.</p>

<p>She saw that her boyfriend was making extremely good progress and getting extra affection and love from the Master.

<p>She and her husband had a lucrative business in Florida. Once she brought the Master a set of china plus a twenty-dollar bill. When she gave him the twenty-dollar bill, she told him, “Unfortunately, I cannot afford to give you a larger amount because our business is not doing well. And after all, why do you need the money? For spiritual people money is not necessary.”</p>
<p>The Master smiled at her and said, “True, true, spiritual people do not need money. They live on air. They don’t need material food.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” she said, “I won’t be able to give you regularly twenty dollars.”</p>
<p>The Master said, “Who wants to have twenty dollars from you regularly? Perhaps this will be your first and last time.”</p>
<p>She said, “How do you know?”</p>
<p>The Master said, “I do not know anything; I only presume.”</p>
<p>The Master was right. All the Master got from this extremely rich woman who followed his path for six months was one twenty-dollar bill.</p>

<p>She felt she had the capacity to transmit spiritual power. She used to get messages from other spiritual Masters and She felt that other Masters transmitted their spiritual power through her because she was so pure and divine. The Master told her it was not because she was pure and divine, but because the other Masters were compassionate. She was severely hurt.</p>
<p>One day she told the Master that she had realised God. She said her realisation was perfect, but it was not as perfect as the Master’s realisation. Therefore, she still needed the Master.</p>
<p>The Master said realisation was a very big word, and he did not want to discuss it. He said he only wanted to discuss aspiration.</p>
<p>She felt that the Master wanted to avoid her. She thought she was such a great leader and felt that the Master did not recognise her as a born leader; he was blind, and what should she do with a blind man? So she left.</p>
