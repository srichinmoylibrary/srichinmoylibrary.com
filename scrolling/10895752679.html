<p>A villager was going to town riding his horse. On the way, the horse became very restless and absolutely unruly. The villager could not keep the horse under control, so he came down and with great difficulty fastened the horse to a tree.</p>
<p>Then he saw that a policeman was also going to town on his horse. The policeman's horse was about to pass very near his own horse. He said to the policeman, "Please, please be very careful! My horse is extremely restless. I cannot control him. Please do not come near my horse."</p>
<p>The policeman cried, "My horse has to be afraid of your horse?" The policeman jumped off his horse and allowed his horse to fight with the villager's horse. Many people, including lots of young boys and girls, came to watch and enjoy the fight. In spite of being tied up, the villager's horse killed the policeman's horse.</p>
<p>The policeman got furious and took the villager to the town chief. The policeman said, "My horse was killed by his horse."</p>
<p>The man had already warned the policeman, "Please, please do not come near my horse," but it was beneath the policeman's dignity to listen. What could the man do?</p>
<p>The judge said to the villager, "Now tell me what happened. How did your horse kill his horse? What happened?"</p>
<p>The villager was so mad and furious. Inwardly he was brooding. He said to himself, "I warned the policeman!" But outwardly he remained absolutely silent.</p>
<p>The judge said, "Idiot! You will be fined since it is all your fault that your horse killed the other horse."</p>
<p>The villager was getting punishment, but even then he kept quiet. The judge said, "What is wrong with you? You cannot open your mouth and tell me what actually happened? Are you dumb?"</p>
<p>The policeman said, "He is not dumb! He warned me so many times that his horse was very unruly, restless and dangerous, but I took my horse there anyway!"</p>
<p>Then the judge said, "Fine, fine. Now I see that you are the idiot!"</p>
<p>The policeman's horse was killed, but because of his stupid statement, the judge fined him 100 rupees. He told the judge, "This fellow warned me, but I did not listen." So the judge said, "Pay for your pride — 100 rupees' fine!"</p>
<p>Then the judge took the money and gave it to the innocent villager.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The punishment</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The punishment" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a man who sold fruit. One day he was selling bad mangoes. Some people bought his mangoes, and then they became furious when they discovered that the mangoes were absolutely rotten and smelled very bad. These customers brought the man to the village chief and made complaints against him.</p>
<p>The village chief said to the man, "The rest of the mangoes you have to eat yourself. All the mangoes you have to eat!"</p>
<p>Then the accused man said, "Let me go to somebody higher than you. Let me see what he says."</p>
<p>When he went to a higher authority, the authority said, "If you do not want to eat the fruit, then the people who are angry with you should beat you up. They should whip you 30 times. Since you do not want to eat the rotten mangoes, the people who have made the complaints should whip you at least 30 times."</p>
<p>The man said, "The first one says I have to eat all the rotten mangoes and the second one says I have to be whipped 30 times! Now let me go to the absolutely highest authority."</p>
<p>He went to the highest authority, and the highest authority said, "You do not have to eat the fruit. You do not have to be beaten or whipped. Just pay 50 rupees. Then it will be all settled. Pay me 50 rupees, and I will distribute the money to the people who have made complaints against you. Now, you make the choice. Do you want to eat the rotten mangoes, do you want to be whipped, or do you want to give the money? Choose whatever punishment you want. It is up to you."</p>
<p>The man said, "I am ready to eat the mangoes."</p>
<p>He started eating the mangoes, and immediately he began vomiting. The judge said, "Whatever you start, you are supposed to complete. You were supposed to eat all the mangoes. You have failed, so now you should be whipped 30 times."</p>
<p>Those who had made complaints started whipping him. After 15 lashes, the man was about to faint. He said, "I cannot bear this punishment!"</p>
<p>The judge said, "Then pay the penalty: 50 rupees."</p>
<p>The man had exactly 50 rupees, so the judge took the money and distributed it to the people who had made complaints against him. Look at the fate of this fellow! First he ate half of the fruits that were so bad. Then he was punished by being whipped fifteen times — half of the sentence. Finally he had to give the full amount of the fine. Then the judge distributed the money to the people who had accused him.</p>
<p>The moral is that if you do one bad thing, you can easily be punished by everybody beyond what you deserve.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The miserable thief</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The miserable thief" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a very, very bad thief. He used to go to work during the day and at night he would steal. He used to commit thefts all the time and torture so many people. So many expensive and valuable things he stole! He learned how to steal from his father. His wife was dead against it, so when his father died, she was inwardly quite happy. Outwardly she cried because her father-in-law had died. But inwardly she was happy, and she started begging her husband, "Please, please, do not follow your father's ways any more. People know that you are stealing, although you are not being caught. Everybody knows that you steal! I am your wife, and I feel miserable when they accuse you. Still you are not being caught. Please promise that you will stop. Otherwise I am going to leave you and I am going to leave our three children with you. You take care of them! I cannot go on like this any more."</p>
<p>Finally the husband said that he would not steal any more. The wife was so happy that he was giving up stealing.</p>
<p>One day the husband came home from work absolutely miserable. The wife said, "What happened? Why are you so miserable? You cannot even talk properly. What happened?"</p>
<p>He said, "You know, when I used to steal, I hid everything in my friend's house. I used to keep all my loot there. Now my friend has taken all the things that I stole, and I do not know where he has gone."</p>
<p>The wife said, "Look, is this not your fate? Many people's things you stole, and now you are miserable because someone else has taken these things away. Just think of those people who had their own things stolen by you! They were the actual owners of those things. Do they not feel infinitely more miserable? See how sad you are! Can you not think of the loss and the sadness of those people who were the actual owners of all those valuables? Again, I am begging you, never steal."</p>
<p>Then the husband promised that he would never, never steal again. Because of his sadness and his sufferings, he gave up stealing. What a nice wife he had! The wife gave such good, moral advice.</p>
