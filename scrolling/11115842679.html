<p>Today I was doing hill work on 150th Street. I was about to complete two miles when I saw the fat lady who used to have two dogs. Now she has only one dog; the other one died. The dog started following me. I knew the dog wouldn't bite me; she was only trying to lick my left knee. I stopped running and the lady said, "Don't be afraid of my dog. She is saying 'Good luck' to you!"</p>

<p>Quite often when I run, many songs appear inside my brain. This afternoon when I was running, two or three new songs came to my mind. Then, after I finished running, I had to sit down and notate the songs.</p>
<p>I will die, but I know my songs will live on. Indians, especially Bengalis, in every nook and cranny will sing my songs.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The embarrassing run</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The embarrassing run" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today I ran four miles with Pahar in Flushing Meadow Park. So many silly and embarrassing things happened! Before I started, I put on heavy clothes — shorts, trousers, plus the thick rubber belt I use to support my back. The first mile, as usual, was at my bullock-cart speed: 9:25. My timing for the next two miles was 8:18 and 7:40.</p>
<p>After the third mile I said, "Now I want to run a fast mile-seven minutes or under." I took off the rubber belt so that I could breathe more deeply. After two hundred metres, what happened? My trousers began falling off on my right side.</p>
<p>First I tried holding them up with my right hand, while I was still pumping with my left hand. Then they started falling down on my left side also. So I had to hold my trousers up with both hands. Whenever I let go, for a few seconds they would stay up and then they would fall down again. Because of this I could not run fast, so my timing was 7:50. Easily I could have gone faster! I forgot that I had on shorts underneath. I should have stopped and taken off my trousers.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I ran seven and a half miles. After five and a half miles I came to the intersection where the Kew Motor Inn is.</p>
<p>It was about a quarter to eight in the morning. I was not in the middle of the street, but all of a sudden someone started honking. I looked around and saw a policeman on a motor bike. He was Puerto Rican. Since nobody else was around, I thought that perhaps I had done something wrong.</p>
<p>The policeman raised both hands and started screaming with joy, "Sri, Sri, Sri!"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "So, I have not committed any crime."</p>
<p>When I reached Main Street, I was about to make a left turn. Then I saw that a car had made a right turn and was waiting across the street. The driver — a fat, black man — was signalling me to come across. When I came near him, he said, "You are a very nice guy. I love you."</p>
<p>So, within eight hundred metres, I met two nice human beings, two really divine beings.</p>

<p>The first year I ran the New York Marathon in 1979, I became so tired after fourteen miles. Then I saw Lavanya. She was doing stretching exercises, but I didn't have the capacity even to bend. Then she went ahead.</p>
<p>As soon as I would come near Radha, she would take off. Then she would relax. When I would catch her again, she would run faster.</p>

<p>At the start of the 1979 Long Island Marathon I was taking such long strides because I was running with Bhashwar, Bhima and a few others. The first thirteen miles I ran so fast! If I had not walked the last three miles, I would have finished in under four hours.</p>
<p>The following year I ran only thirteen miles, and Lavanya skated the full twenty-six miles. I thought I was running behind Shephali and Savita, but afterwards I found out it was Shephali and Amy. All the time I was hiding and keeping behind them. Shephali didn't recognise me at all.</p>

<p>During the New York Marathon at least five people recognised me, although I was not wearing a Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team uniform. Some of them called out, "Keep going, keep going! Don't give up, Sri!" Some people were saying, "Go, Sri Chinmoy!" because Sushobhan, who was running with me, had on a Centre jacket.</p>
<p>Some of the 24-hour-race participants saw me and thanked me for the race. They are very nice people.</p>
<p>It is so funny! You pass people at fifteen or sixteen miles, smiling and smiling. Then, without any warning, cramps come later — at about twenty miles. Then you have to stop and walk.</p>
<p>One policeman said to me, "You can't walk, you have to run." He was encouraging me to run, but I was dying.</p>

<p>I was in California for two and a half days. We had several races. In the two-mile race, I did nine seconds over my best two-mile timing: 13:51. In San Diego we had a four-hundred-metre race. My timing there was seven seconds more than my best four-hundred-metre timing. One of our Seattle disciples bragged that he was going to win the two-mile race. Then Astika defeated him badly. But he did come in second or third — to everybody's surprise.</p>

<p>During our seventy-mile race the young son of George Gardiner, the American record-holder for one hundred miles on a track, came up to me and said he wanted to talk to me privately.

Then, when Bhashwar took our picture, I put my arm around him. His name is John.</p>

<p>George couldn't believe I was meditating on him in the tent. He sat up and said, "Thank you for everything." Before he got his prize, over the microphone he thanked me for saving his life.</p>
