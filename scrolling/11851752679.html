<p>When Swami Vivekananda came to Chicago, his dynamic vital embraced the whole world. In his very first speech, he began, "Sisters and Brothers of America..." After those words, he was unable to continue for two full minutes because of the enthusiastic cheering and clapping of the audience. Immediately, Swami Vivekananda had spread the feeling that we are all sisters and brothers of the same family. He showed the seekers of the West that he came to embrace them, not to conquer them. And, as a result, he conquered their hearts because his words came from the very depths of his soul.</p>
<p>True, we use the terms 'sister' and 'brother' at every moment, but do we have the same depths of feeling as Vivekananda? In comparison to him, we are all frauds. We do not have the same genuine feeling as Vivekananda had when we use those terms. For us, it is like saying "Ladies and Gentlemen." It is simply a form of address. When Vivekananda said, "Sisters and Brothers of America," it was based on his dynamic all-embracing vital.</p>

<p>Swami Vivekananda's soul-stirring addresses at the Parliament of Religions inspired the audience to have faith in all the religions of the world and to hug the best in each religion. There was a magic spell of throbbing delight woven around his very name at the Parliament. He was the figure that dominated the world's gaze there.</p>
<p>A report appeared in <em>The Boston Evening Transcript</em> of September 30th, 1893 about the great triumph of this Indian spiritual giant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded, and this marked approval of thousands he accepts in a childlike spirit of gratification, without a trace of conceit.</p>

<p>An interesting event took place when Swami Vivekananda was staying in a cottage at Thousand Island Park. It was a dark and rainy night. Two ladies from Detroit had travelled hundreds of miles to find him there.</p>
<p>Having met him, one of them humbly spoke out, "We have come to you just as we would go to Jesus if he were still on earth and ask him to teach us."</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda, deeply moved and overwhelmed with humility, replied, "If only I possessed the power of Christ to set you free now!"</p>

<p>When Swami Vivekananda returned home from his trip abroad, he travelled by steamer from Naples to Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he was given an overwhelming reception. He then made his way to his native land and finally reached Madras. Everywhere he went, he was hailed by multitudes.</p>
<p>From Madras, Swami Vivekananda decided to travel by steamer to Calcutta, the city of his birth. As the steamer sailed up the river Hooghly, Swami Vivekananda repeatedly drank water from the river to purify himself after his long absence.</p>

<p>When Swami Vivekananda arrived in Calcutta after his triumph in America, there was a big meeting. In front of thousands of people, his brother disciple, Swami Brahmananda, touched his feet and garlanded him.</p>
<p>Vivekananda said to him, "What are you doing, what are you doing?" Brahmananda replied in Bengali, "You are my elder brother, so you are like my father. That is why I am bowing to you."</p>
<p>Then Vivekananda touched Brahmananda's feet and said, "The son of the Guru is like the Guru himself."</p>
<p>So both of them were bowing to each other in front of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Then, when Swami Vivekananda reached the age of thirty-nine, he said, "I will not cross the barrier of forty. I do not want to live. My time has come."</p>
<p>He kept his promise. He passed away at the age of thirty-nine years and five months. He had worked extremely hard while he was on earth. He suffered a lot. So when his time came, he wanted to leave. His great destiny was to die before forty. Can you imagine? And we do not even start our life before forty!</p>

As they were cremating his body, she was about thirty metres away. She was not near the pyre at all. She was sitting on the ground, crying bitterly. Suddenly, a burning charcoal flew up and landed in her lap. How it came there, nobody knows, but it flew to her and fell on her lap.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part V — Stories about Christian saints</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V — Stories about Christian saints" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
TRNS 24-33. These stories for children about the lives of some of the Christian saints were told by Sri Chinmoy in June 1981.</p>
<h2>The Virgin Mary appears in a dream</h2>

<p>There was once a little girl who came of a poor family. Her parents could not send her to school because they were so poor. As a result, this little girl could not read or write properly, but she had the earnest desire to learn how to read and write. Her parents were very spiritual and they taught her how to pray.</p>
<p>The little girl used to pray daily most soulfully and then she used to help her parents in their work. Late at night, when her parents were fast asleep, she used to get up secretly and try to teach herself to read and write. She wanted to read and write well so that she could be of real help to her family. She wanted to be able to work outside and bring money home to support her family.</p>
<p>One night, when the little girl was fast asleep, she had a dream. In the dream, the Virgin Mary came to her in a vivid form and said, "You do not have to learn how to read and write. You have to do only three things in your life in order to please God."</p>
<p>Already the young girl used to pray and meditate very soulfully every day. So the Virgin Mary told her, "The first thing is to keep your heart always pure. The second thing is not to criticise anybody, not to speak ill of anybody. The third thing is, when you think of your own troubles, think how much more Jesus suffered when he was on earth. His suffering will be much more than yours. So if you can do these three things, you will be very happy and God will be most pleased with you."</p>
<p>The girl obeyed the Virgin Mary. In the course of time, when she grew up, she joined a convent and became a nun. She did a splendid job, both for God and for humanity. Her name was Veronica. We call her Saint Veronica. She was born in a village near Milan, Italy.</p>
<p><em>Spiritual commentary:</em></p>
<p>Veronica always listened to her superiors. She was rightly convinced that to listen to one's superiors is to obey God. You, too, sweet children, should listen to your superiors, starting with your own parents. It is as good as obeying our Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>The most important thing is the message that Veronica received from the Virgin Mary: you have to be pure of heart and not criticise others. When you think you have all kinds of troubles, remember what kind of suffering Jesus went through. And, when you listen to your parents, immediately think that you are listening to God. Immediately think that what they are saying is for your good and, if you can please them, then you are pleasing God.</p>
<p>My sweet, sweeter, sweetest children, I want you all to be like saints.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Mother&#039;s chosen child</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Mother&#039;s chosen child" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>She was of poor parents and she was poor in health. Earthly poverty was her outer name. Heavenly prosperity was her inner name. One day her parents sent her and her younger sister together to collect firewood. She had an unexpected vision. A beautiful lady appeared before her. The lady was dressed in blue and white and she was holding a rosary in her right hand. She was full of compassion and love.</p>
<p>The lady blessingfully smiled at the older sister and made the sign of the cross. The girl at once fell on her knees, took out her own rosary and started praying. The beautiful lady told her that she had something special to do on earth, that she must pray every day devotedly for the sinners. Also the lady told her that she would suffer much on earth, but in Heaven she would rejoice.</p>
<p>When she grew up, the young girl became a nun. She was humility incarnate. Simplicity, sincerity and humility everybody appreciated in her.</p>
<p>The same lady, the Mother of Christ, appeared before her eighteen more times. One day her younger sister said to her, "Look, everybody appreciates and admires you because you are a chosen child of the Mother."</p>
<p>She replied, "How can I be proud? She has chosen me because I am the most ignorant of all."</p>
<p>One day the Mother appeared before her and said, "Dig in the mud." She did as she was asked and, lo and behold, water began to spring up. Over the years, many miracles have been performed when people use this holy water from Lourdes.</p>
<p>She is our Saint Bernadette.</p>

<p>There was a fisherman who became a close disciple of the Christ. Before the Christ left for Heaven, he asked this disciple to be head of the church. The disciple preached the gospel and took special care of the Church.</p>
<p>At first he worked very hard in Jerusalem and other places. Then he became Bishop of Rome. At that time, Rome was a most undivine city. But the disciple's exemplary devotedness, along with the Lord's infinite Compassion, brought many lost souls to the Christ.</p>
<p>He was martyred for his faith. Since his departure from the earth-scene, there has always been a Bishop of Rome. This disciple is now known as the first Pope. The Pope is he who represents the Christ on earth. His successors are lovingly called the Holy Father by all.</p>
<p>He is our Saint Peter. It was Christ who gave him the name Peter, meaning 'rock'. The Christ told him, "It is upon this rock that I will build My Church."</p>

As a matter of fact, it was Saul who used to torture mercilessly the followers of Christ and it was also he who stoned to death the first martyr, St. Stephen.</p>
<p>One day Saul was riding a horse in the city of Damascus. He saw a very bright light all around him. He fell down from his horse. Then he heard a voice, "Saul, Saul, why do you want to persecute Me? What have I done to you?"</p>
<p>Saul asked, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>The voice replied, "I am Jesus. Do you not realise that it will be hard for you to kick against the good?"</p>
<p>Saul was deeply moved and he began trembling. He begged the Christ, "Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. Forgive all my sins. You tell me what I should do."</p>
<p>The Lord said, "Accept Me, spread My Light all over."</p>
<p>"Lord, I promise You I shall do that," said Saul.</p>
<p>From that time onwards, Saul travelled all over the world spreading the message of Christ. Very hard he worked. Very much he suffered. But nothing could stop him from bringing souls to the Christ. He was always soulfully adamant in that. He was more than ready to suffer for the Christ and to bring lost souls to the Christ.</p>
<p>When Saul was very old, he was sentenced to prison. After many years in prison, he was beheaded.</p>
<p>During his life, Saul wrote fourteen most soulful, most powerful letters to the Christians. These letters now adorn the Holy Bible. They are called Epistles. They are read every morning at early mass.</p>
<p>This is the transformation of Saul into our Saint Paul.</p>

<p>The undivine not only surrenders ultimately to the Divine, but also listens to the Divine completely and unconditionally.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The slave turns over a new leaf</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The slave turns over a new leaf" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was a slave who was in the habit of stealing. One day he stole something very valuable from his master, Philemon, and ran away to Rome. On the way, he felt miserable that he had stolen from his master, and so he went to see the great apostle St. Paul, who was then in prison because of his faith.</p>
<p>St. Paul had a big heart. He showed much affection and love to the slave. Since the slave had now repented of his misdeed, St. Paul hoped that his master would forgive him. The master, who was a Christian, happened to be a friend of St. Paul's. Therefore, he listened to the request of the saint.</p>
<p>When the slave returned to his master's house, the master saw that the slave had totally turned over a new leaf. Not only had he turned over a new leaf, but he was expressing deep interest in the spiritual life. So the master set him free and said, "You can spend your life for God."</p>
<p>The former slave was so happy and delighted. He went back to St. Paul and became a very devoted server to him. He became an excellent God-seeker and man-server. St. Paul made him a priest and later, even a bishop.</p>
<p>It seems that the power of ignorance is all-where. Although, in his case, the former slave had conquered ignorance, his enemies stoned him to death, for they could not tolerate his exemplary faith in Christ and his extraordinary service to the God-lovers.</p>
<p>He is our Saint Onesimus.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A Swedish saint</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A Swedish saint" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This story is about a little girl who was born in Sweden. Her parents were holy people. At the age of seven, the little girl was sent to a convent for education. When she was fourteen years old, her parents married her to a young nobleman.</p>
<p>She always spoke to her husband about her love of God and about how desperately she needed to lead a spiritual life. Her husband said, "Let us lead together a brotherly and sisterly life." So this young couple lived a pure and pious life. Together they used to pray to God and they used to serve the people in their town.</p>
<p>Many of the girl's relatives did not approve of her spiritual life. They mocked at her and insulted her, but she was not at all disturbed. She consecrated her life totally to God's Will.</p>
<p>One day, quite unexpectedly, her husband died. Since the girl was quite young and beautiful, many men requested to marry her. She flatly refused. She said, "My husband and I loved God together. Now he is with Him. I shall pray every day for hours to please my God."</p>
<p>When the girl's mother died, she entered into a convent. Her simplicity, sincerity and purity fulfilled her God in her completely. She is our Saint Catherine.</p>
