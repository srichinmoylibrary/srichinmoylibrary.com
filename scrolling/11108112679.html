  <h2 id="page-title">Humanity&#039;s promise</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Humanity&#039;s promise" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Humanity's promise to humanity is a life of service. Humanity's promise to divinity is a life of oneness. Humanity's promise to God is a life of perfection. But this perfection is preceded and followed by service and oneness. Oneness has to be found in perfection and service has to be found in oneness. So we can safely say that humanity's promise to God is a life of service, oneness and perfection.</p>
<p>Service is Eternity's meaningful achievement. Oneness is Infinity's soulful achievement. Perfection is Immortality's fruitful achievement. Service is the transformation of the human within us. Oneness is the realisation of the divine within us. Perfection is the satisfaction of the Supreme within us.</p>
<p>God says to the body, "Body, promise Me that you will not always sleep." The body says to God, "Father, I promise You that I shall listen to You. Now, do accept a promise of my own. My promise to You is that I shall try to be always wakeful, alert and vigilant."</p>
<p>God says to the vital, "Vital, promise Me that you will no longer be aggressive." The vital says to God, "Father, I shall abide by Your Command. In addition, I wish to offer You a promise of my own. From now on I shall be divinely dynamic always."</p>
<p>God says to the mind, "Mind, promise Me that you will no longer cherish your friendship with doubt. Doubt can no longer be your friend." The mind says to God, "Father, I shall definitely listen to You. I also have a promise of my own, and that promise is that I shall make friends only with faith. I will have faith only as my friend. I shall live with faith and I shall fulfil my existence on earth only in faith, for faith — soulful, fruitful, all-offering, all-embracing faith."</p>
<p>God says to the heart, "Heart, promise Me that from now on you will not feel insecure under any circumstances." The heart says to God, "Father, I give You my word of honour that I shall not in any way feel insecure. I shall listen to Your Command. Now, my promise to You is that I shall establish my oneness-existence with each human being in Your entire creation. I shall feel and cherish my oneness with all throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>The divine in us promises; the human in us forgets. Again, the Supreme in us revives all our countless promises and fulfils them. Our promise and our aspiration — the inner cry, the mounting flame — are two intimate friends. Promise says to aspiration: "Friend, I do know what to do. I have to establish a life of divinity here on earth. Then there will be no ignorance, no darkness, no limitations, no bondage. I know that this is what I have to accomplish." Aspiration says to promise: "Friend, let me tell you how you can do it. You can do it only on the strength of your self-giving. Give what you have, give what you are at every moment. Then only your goal will not remain a far cry. What do you have? A soulful cry. This is what you can give to mankind. And what are you? You are God's eternal Dream, the Dream that every moment is in the process of blossoming."</p>
<p>Humanity's promise is a movement forward, upward and inward. Humanity's forward movement leads us to the universal Reality and helps us claim the entire creation of God as our very own. Humanity's upward movement carries us to the transcendental Height and helps us claim the transcendental Reality as our very own. Humanity's inward movement leads us to God Himself: God the Dream, God the Reality, God the Silence, God the Sound, God the Omniscient, Omnipotent and Omnipresent. It is within our aspiration's abode that God's Presence looms large.</p>
<p>Our forward movement is for the recognition of the universal Reality. Our upward movement is for the recognition of the transcendental Reality. Our inward movement is for the recognition of the eternally Real in us: God the Supreme. Humanity has a promise. This promise is self-discovery. Self-discovery comes from self-mastery, and again, self-mastery comes from self-discovery. When we dive deep within we discover our reality-existence, and when we spread our vision-light around us we achieve self-mastery. The most effective way to attain self-mastery is to spread our heart's light, which is the Vision of the Supreme within us. If we spread our vision-light, then the darkness around us surrenders and becomes transformed.</p>
<p>Humanity itself is a promise: a promise of God to Himself, for each individual is a portion of God's Reality-Existence and God's Vision-Existence. Each individual is a representative of God's ultimate Height on earth. In and through each individual God fulfils something unique in Himself. God's promise to Himself is His Aspiration, His Realisation, His Revelation and His Manifestation in and through each individual being.</p>
<p>Each individual has already made an inner promise to humanity. Again, humanity also has made an inner promise to each individual. Each individual, when he prays and meditates and enters into his highest transcendental Height, looks around and sees countless beings around him. At that time he feels it is his bounden duty to carry all and sundry — all human beings, all his brothers and sisters — to the highest Height. This is his promise.</p>
<p>And humanity, as a collective soul, promises to each individual that it will offer him the universal Light and Delight. Mere height is not all. The vision and reality have to embrace the entire creation. Length and breadth as well as height are equally needed. The individual will carry the collective soul to the height and humanity, the collective soul, will carry the individual to the universal Reality within all of us.</p>
<p>We have to know whether we shall always remain with mere promise or whether we shall go one step ahead. That step is commitment. There is a great difference between promise and commitment. Promise can be a mere word, a meaningless, fruitless and lifeless gift. But when it is commitment, the soul's commitment to mankind, inside the commitment itself the illumining reality and the fulfilling reality abide.</p>
<p>The promises that we have made to God, to mankind, to ourselves must be transformed into conscious, constant and unconditional commitments. It is inside the heart of commitment that all the promises of the past, present and future can blossom into fulfilling reality. Humanity's promise to God: "Take me." God's promise to humanity: "I am accepting you."</p>
<p>Each soul offers a solemn promise to mankind when it enters into the earth-arena. Ordinary souls and special souls both make promises. In the case of ordinary souls, because of countless weaknesses and the teeming ignorance all around, it is difficult for them to fulfil their promises. But great souls quite often fulfil their promises because they have an indomitable will. Souls of the superlative degree, who are constantly one with the Will of the Supreme who are absolutely direct representatives of the Supreme, come into the world with the loftiest promise. Now, unlike ordinary souls or even great souls, they deal with the entire humanity. Their promise is most sublime and, at the same time, most difficult to execute. But they are not earth-bound. They are Heaven-free. They live on earth for a few years — thirty, forty, fifty, eighty — and then go back to their heavenly abode.</p>
<p>Three souls of the highest calibre, the highest magnitude the highest order have come into the world. Sri Krishna came into the world to establish the divine code of life: righteousness must reign supreme; wickedness must give way to righteousness and a life of light. But his promise has not yet been fulfilled. There are still wicked people on earth wickedness still looms large and reigns supreme, But he has not given up his promise. In and through you and me and each individual he is trying to conquer humanity's wickedness and replace it with the divine code of life, which is justice-light all around.</p>
<p>The Buddha came and promised to make the world at large a world without suffering. There will not remain an iota of suffering here on earth, he said. He tried his best, but the world is still suffering like anything. Yet he has not given up his promise. His promise is now being executed in and through us, in and through each individual seeker here on earth. Each seeker wants to free himself and also the entire world from suffering. So the loftiest promise of the Buddha is now being executed in and through each individual seeker on earth.</p>
<p>The third soul of the highest magnitude is the Christ, the Son, the Saviour. His promise to mankind was the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven. We all know what the Kingdom of Heaven will look like. There will be no ignorance, no darkness, no bondage, no limitation, but only boundless light, boundless delight, boundless harmony, boundless peace. All divine qualities in boundless measure will comprise the Kingdom of Heaven. Right now, when we look around we see anything but the Kingdom of Heaven. Does it mean that the Christ has given up his promise to mankind? No, not in the least. His promise is now percolating, his promise is now flowing like a river in and through each individual seeker on earth. The Kingdom of Heaven must come into existence — either today or tomorrow or in the near future or in the distant future. The promise of the Saviour Christ will definitely be fulfilled in the course of human evolution. No God-Promise can remain unfulfilled. The promise that God made to mankind through Sri Krishna, the promise that God made to mankind through the Buddha, the promise that God made to mankind through the Christ, the promises that God is offering to mankind through you, through me, through each individual seeker, will all be fulfilled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A new teacher: heart</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="A new teacher: heart" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Here we are all seekers. We are consciously seeking God's Light; but there was a time when we did not seek God's Light, even unconsciously. Now we consciously seek, but yesterday we did not seek at all. We are all students. Previously we also were students; at that time we had a teacher and the name of that teacher was mind. Now we have a new teacher, and the name of that teacher is heart. Our previous teacher asked us to walk along the desire-road. As we were students, we walked along the desire-road in order to get the satisfaction which the teacher promised us. For it is satisfaction that makes life meaningful and fruitful. But to our surprise, the mind could not offer us satisfaction. Each time we took a step ahead, instead of satisfaction it was all frustration; instead of real happiness, it was false, totally false pleasure. We were totally dissatisfied and we changed teachers.</p>
<p>We previously tried to please the mind, so that we could derive happiness from life, but there was no happiness. Now we have a new teacher, the heart. The new teacher tells us that we can and shall get happiness only if we please God in God's own way. The new teacher tells us we can never achieve happiness unless we become one with happiness itself. Happiness itself is the soul in us.</p>
<p>The mind does not have happiness. If I do not have something, how can I give you that very thing? Because the mind has no happiness, it can't teach us. The heart says, "I cannot give you happiness, but I know someone who has happiness and who is all happiness, and this person is eager to grant you happiness. I shall take you to that particular happiness-reality and you can achieve and receive as much as you want." So the heart takes us to the soul, which is all Light and Delight. The heart says it does not have joy of its own, but only when it becomes inseparably one with the soul does it become really happy.</p>
<p>The heart says, "O human being, O seeker, you have not an iota of happiness. And I have only limited happiness, limited joy. But I know someone who has boundless happiness, and I am more than eager to take you to him. As your teacher, I am telling you, O seeker, walk along with me. I am leading you to the Source. I am guiding you, I am leading you; but it is up to you if you want to find it. Stay in the soul and you will get unlimited joy, happiness and satisfaction. I cannot give you happiness in my own way, but I am being guided by the soul.</p>
<p>"The mind, your previous teacher, wanted to guide you in its own way. But the mind is not aware of the destination, so how can you expect the mind to give you the message of the destination, let alone take you there? I am not the destination, but I have seen the destination, and I will take you there. Like you, I will try to develop capacity, O seeker, and from the destination receive infinite joy and happiness. Our destination is eager to give us constant satisfaction, joy and Delight."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My captain commands, &quot;Go on!&quot;</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="My captain commands, &amp;quot;Go on!&amp;quot;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My captain commands, "Go on! Go on! Go on!" The captain is the Lord Supreme within us. The captain has commanded, "Children, go on, go on." But right now we have become inseparably one with the body, the vital, the mind and the heart.</p>
<p>The human body tells the seeker in us, "Look, we have become one. Let us tell God that we wish to sleep for some time and then we shall accept Him, we shall accept His command." So the human body and the seeker tell God that they will enjoy sleep for a short while and then they will listen to God's dictates.</p>
<p>God immediately says to the human body and the seeker in us that they can do so. If they want to sleep, they can sleep. But after some time they have to wake up; they have to accept God and walk along the road of Light and Delight. So the body and the seeker start to sleep and sleep and sleep. They do not want to wake up. Sometimes they forget to get up; sometimes they deliberately do not get up. Therefore, they do not proceed along the road of Light and Delight to the Golden Shores of the Beyond.</p>
<p>The vital and the seeker within us say to God, "Lord, we shall listen to Your command. But before that, allow us to fight, struggle and win. That is to say, before we proceed, before we march on towards the ultimate Goal, let us dominate and lord it over the world for a few days, a few months, a few years. After that, we shall definitely abide by Your command; we shall walk, march and run towards the destined Goal."</p>
<p>God says to the vital and the seeker, "Granted. But don't forget that after you have fought with the world and won your supremacy, after you have dominated the world in your own way, you have to walk along the road of Eternity to reach perfection in life."</p>
<p>Both the seeker in us and the vital in us then fight against the world and bring the world under their feet. They dominate the world and they are satisfied. But then they don't want to walk along the road any farther. They don't want to reach the destined Goal. They are satisfied. They have forgotten the promise they made to God that after they enjoyed their supremacy they would walk along the road to reach the highest Truth and Light.</p>
<p>When the mind and the seeker become one, they say to God, "Lord, we shall definitely listen to You. You want us to march on along the road, and we shall do so. But before that, please allow us to think, to judge, to see if the world deserves our faith or our doubt. Let us spend some time either in doubting the world or in having faith in the world, in thinking of ourselves or in thinking of the world. When all this is done, we shall without fail proceed along Eternity's road. To please You, to fulfil Your command, we shall without fail reach the highest Height."</p>
<p>God, out of His infinite Bounty, says to the mind and the seeker in us, "Children, all right, I wish to fulfil your desire. But don't forget to fulfil My desire after you have fulfilled your own desire. You have to walk far, farther, farthest. You have to walk along Eternity's road in order to reach the highest Goal."</p>
<p>So the mind and the seeker within us start thinking of the world, thinking about the world within them and the world without. Then day and night they start doubting the world, or occasionally they exercise their faith in the world. That is enough for them. They become satisfied and totally forget their promise to God. They don't want to walk anymore. They don't want the highest Truth, the highest Light, the highest Reality, the illumining Perfection and fulfilling Satisfaction.</p>
<p>So the body, the vital and the mind fail.</p>
<p>But the seeker in us also has the heart, and the heart has the seeker. They become friends. They are doubtful in the beginning whether they will be able to walk along this eternal road. They see that their brothers, the body, the vital and the mind, have totally failed. They had good intentions — they just wanted to sleep a little, they just wanted to dominate a little, they just wanted to doubt a little and then they were ready to please God in His own way. But they failed. They did not keep their promises to God.</p>
<p>So the heart in us and the seeker in us are confused and worried when they start. They say to God, "We want to please You in Your own way, in spite of knowing that the rest of the members of our family have failed You. We would also like to come to You by doing something."</p>
<p>God says, "What is it?"</p>
<p>The seeker and the heart say, "We wish to identify ourselves with the achievements of the body, vital and mind."</p>
<p>God says, "Their achievements are nothing but frustration and destruction."</p>
<p>The heart says, "We know, but we are tempted to feel their frustration and destruction first, then immediately come to You for satisfaction. We will definitely start walking along Eternity's road, for we desperately need abiding satisfaction."</p>
<p>God says to the heart and the seeker, "Yes, My children. You can try."</p>
<p>So the heart becomes one with the body, the vital and the mind. Then the quality of the body, lethargy, the quality of the vital, aggression or supremacy, the quality of the mind, suspicion and division, all immediately enter into the heart! On the one hand, it was more than eager to please God in His own way when it saw the confusion that the body, vital and mind had created by not doing so. But temptation arose in the aspiring human heart, and because of this temptation the heart became one, inseparably one, with the rest of the members of the family before it was in a position to offer its existence totally to the Supreme Pilot, the Captain Supreme.</p>
<p>So the heart and the seeker become helplessly and hopelessly one with the body, vital and mind for some time. Then, after having known and felt their suffering, torture and ignorance-night, the heart starts to cry out for Light and Truth. The body is satisfied with its achievements. The vital is satisfied with its achievements. The mind is satisfied with its achievements. But the heart, fortunately, is not satisfied with its achievements. The heart wants to achieve something else, something higher, something deeper, something more fulfilling and illumining. So the heart leaves the body, vital and mind and approaches God.</p>
<p>It says to God, "Lord, I am entirely Yours. Now tell me, shall I stay with You and receive Your Light while walking along the road, or shall I stay inside the body, the vital and the mind to cry for Your Light? Which do You want? Shall I give up my body-consciousness, shall I give up my vital-consciousness, shall I give up my mind-consciousness in order to please You? Or shall I remain inside them and invoke Your Light? Please tell me."</p>
<p>God says to the heart-seeker, "If you are really brave, if you feel that you can pray and meditate inside the lethargic body, the aggressive vital, the doubtful and suspicious mind, then I have no objection. But it is an almost impossible task. You have to come out of the body-consciousness. You have to come out of the vital-consciousness. You have to come out of the mental consciousness. First you have to be inundated with boundless Light, and then only can you enter the body-consciousness and change its lethargy into alertness and dynamism; then only can you change the aggression of the vital into a positive will for God-manifestation; then only can you change the mind's doubt and lack of faith into constant faith. If you want to please the young members of your family — your body, vital and mind — you have to first become strong and please Me. Heart, if you please Me in My own way, only then will the rest of the members of your family be pleased."</p>
<p>The heart fully accepts God's Command and wholeheartedly tries to fulfil God's will; therefore, the heart becomes inseparably one with God's will, and receives and achieves Light in abundant measure. Then God tells the heart to enter into the mind, to enter into the vital, to enter into the physical body for their illumination, and the heart enters. It suffers a lot because the body-consciousness does not want to accept the heart's light, the vital-consciousness does not want to accept the heart's light and the mental consciousness does not want to accept the heart's light.</p>
<p>But the heart in the meantime has developed boundless patience, and this patience is the lengthening of time itself. Patience is the constant expansion of time within us. So now the seeker and his heart are inundating the seeker's physical body, inundating his vital and inundating his mind, with the Light of the Supreme. They are not being compelled to do this by any outer forces or by the members of their family, but they are acting out of their inseparable inner oneness with the Lord Supreme who wants them to illumine the younger members of their family.</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers. Individually we seek, collectively we seek. We seek for Truth, we seek for Light, we seek for perfection within and without. In order to discover perfection in life, what we need is a flood of Light and Delight within us.</p>
<p>We have to know that what we have principally is the heart and the mind: the mind that is constantly bringing us the message of subtraction and division, and the heart that is constantly bringing us the message of addition and multiplication. It is through addition and multiplication that illumination, salvation, liberation, realisation and perfection evolve.</p>
<p>We are all seekers of the infinite Truth. Let us feel from now on that what we have is only the heart. The heart can not only fulfil the divine in us, but it can awaken the stone consciousness and the plant consciousness in us and transform the animal in us. It is the divine qualities of our heart that can awaken the stone life and plant life in us and at the same time, transform the animal in us, illumine the human in us and fulfil the divine in us. So let us try to become this heart which has the inner longing to fulfil God in all the members o our family.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The inner call</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="The inner call" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The inner call is not everything, but on the basis of the inner call we make a choice. Sometimes the inner call is a tempting one. Sometimes the inner call is an illumining one. For those who are not sincere, the inner call is temptation. But for those who are sincere, the inner call is always illumination.</p>
<p>When we get the inner call, very often we notice a few conflicting forces. These forces are from the desire life and from the aspiration life. The forces of the desire life tell us that we are under obligation to remain with them, since for many, many years they have fed us, nourished us and fulfilled us according to their capacity. But the forces of aspiration tell us that only a new life, a new nourishment, can give us happiness and satisfaction. If we properly accept the call of aspiration, then we begin walking along the path of illumination. But if we do not properly accept the call of aspiration, we feel that the forces of aspiration are nothing but temptation forces. We feel that we are being invited by the unknown and that we may be totally swallowed by the unknown.</p>
<p>As I said before, based on the inner call we make a choice. Sometimes we make a choice to become good. Then we have to decide how far we want to go with the call. In order to become good, we have to give up quite a few things, and we have to accept and adopt quite a few things. But we have to know that the things that we are giving up are not worth having. At the same time, anything that is worth keeping from our previous life — from our life of desire-anything that can be transformed, illumined and perfected, that we shall not give up.</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow we shall observe the fourth of July, a day which is most significant in the firmament not only of America but also of the entire world. What do we notice here? We notice that two hundred years ago there was a significant call that came directly from the Absolute Supreme. This call reached a considerable height, and the inner beauty, the inner light and the inner perfection from that height were received by awakened Americans and by the world at large.</p>
<p>Always there will be a call, and the call will come to each individual on a different plane. It can come on the political plane, on the spiritual plane, or on any other plane. When we hear that call we have to know how far we should go with it on the physical plane, on the vital plane, on the mental plane, on the psychic plane. Each plane is limitless, and it is we who have to decide how far to go according to our capacity and receptivity. Some people want only to start their journey, while others want to walk a considerable distance and still others want to reach the destination. Again, there will be a few who will not be satisfied even when they reach the destination. They want to come back to the starting point again to teach others how to walk properly and how to reach the goal.</p>
<p>Seekers who follow the inner call ultimately reach God. Some do so on the strength of a mutual agreement with this inner call. They feel that they will give what they can give, and they will get from the call, from the choice, from God, what God can give. Again, there are some higher seekers who reach God on the strength of their conscious, constant surrender to their inner call. They tell God that they will do everything unconditionally right from the beginning to the end. These seekers God is extremely pleased with, both in Heaven and on earth. But sometimes they break their unconditional surrender to God's Will.Some of them fail to keep their promise on earth. And some of them, while they are on earth, do become unconditionally surrendered to God's Will; but then, when they go to Heaven, they may not keep their promise, keep their surrender to God's Will. In spite of being fully illumined, they make an emotional demand of God. It is not a human emotional demand, but it is a kind of charming, illumined emotional demand. Those seekers tell the Absolute Supreme "Look how much we have suffered on earth. We saw that people were hungry and we wanted to help and serve them. But almost all of them misunderstood us and kicked us. Why go back again, when we see that earth is unwilling to accept light? Now that we are in Heaven, please allow us to remain in perfect peace. On earth we helped according to our capacity, our aspiration. Here we wish to acquire another capacity, the capacity to stay in peace and watch. Watching is also a capacity."</p>
<p>In some cases, the Absolute Supreme grants their request. "My children, you have worked so hard. If you don't want to go back, since you feel there is no hope, then you can stay. I never lose hope, but if you want to take an indefinite rest, I will allow you. But if you don't go back to earth, it will make Me sad." When God says this, some of the seekers and Masters in the soul's world feel sad. They immediately change their attitude; they become brave, and they do come back. And when they come back, they feel inwardly that this time they will have a better environment, they will have better students, they will have a better spiritual Master. It may happen, however, that they get a worse environment, worse students, a worse spiritual Master. But if they are really brave, even then they struggle to the end. They may win or lose, but they take everything as an experience, and they keep coming back.</p>
<p>No matter which plane the inner call comes on, whether it is on the physical plane, the vital plane, the mental plane or the psychic plane, once we start our journey, we should not go back. If we want to go back, then we may be on the physical plane, but our consciousness will be on the inconscient plane, at the stone level, the plant level or animal level.</p>
<p>Even those who are very bad students in the aspiration world are far better than those who are still living in the desire world. If we totally give up the world of aspiration and go back to the ordinary world, to the desire life, then we are going back to the plane where there is no satisfaction. Just because the inner plane is not giving us satisfaction in our own way, we cannot go back to the plane where we have seen that there is no satisfaction at all. We have to continue from where we are. Today I am not getting anything to drink. Shall I then drink filthy, dirty water? Since my goal is to drink Nectar, I shall not go back and be satisfied with dirty, filthy water, even if I cannot drink Nectar today. No, I will go on, go on.</p>
<p>It is not that no one has ever drunk Nectar. There are people who have drunk Nectar. Sri Krishna, Lord Buddha, the Christ, Sri Ramakrishna and others have drunk Nectar. And they started their journey like us.</p>
<p>Take the Buddha, for example. The Buddha received a call. The Buddha had everything; he was the prince. He had a most beautiful wife, a child, a kingdom. He had money-power, he had, world-enjoyment, everything. But he gave all this up when he got the inner call.</p>
<p>In the Buddha's case, the world of desire was all around him. When the call came, he gave up everything. But in Sri Ramakrishna's case, he did not enter into the desire world at all.</p>
<p>For Sri Aurobindo, the call came when he was serving as a professor. And from that call he entered into politics. Then another call came, and he gave up politics and entered into seclusion for God-realisation and manifestation.</p>
<p>In Vivekananda's case, in spite of being well-educated according to Western standards, when the call came he went and fell at the feet of someone who did not care for earthly knowledge or education at all. In order to fulfil the call, he just placed himself at the feet of someone who could nourish him spiritually. Again, there was considerable conflict in his life. When he was going through conflict, at times he would go back to the ordinary life. But his inner call was so powerful that in spite of this conflict, he was able to maintain the intensity of his inner call.</p>
<p>When we get an inner call, no matter where we are, we have to go forward. Even if we are standing at the head of the line, we have to go forward. When we go forward because of an inner call, it means a special blessing has descended upon us. But if we do not avail ourselves of this opportunity, it may take a number of years, a whole lifetime, or quite a few incarnations before we get another call. To receive a call is not like receiving an earthly meal. If we have missed a meal, then in a few hours' time we will be able to eat again. If we have missed lunch, we know we will get supper in three or four hours. But once we miss an inner call, we may have to wait for centuries before we can get inner nourishment again. An earthly meal lasts two or three hours. But the meal that we get from the inner call may last for centuries. We can live for Eternity on the inner meal which we get when we listen to the inner call.</p>
<p>Once we accept the spiritual life, the inner life, and listen to the inner call, we totally change the course of our development. Here we are all seekers. True, we have all kinds of weaknesses and defects, but from the strict spiritual point of view, we are not human beings. God tells us that once we accept the spiritual life we should never think of ourselves as human beings. The moment we start aspiring, we become divine beings. Again, there are grades of divinity. In the world of divinity, somebody can be more divine than somebody else. There will be some who do not yet take God seriously, who do not take Truth seriously, who do not take Light seriously. And there will be others who do take God seriously, but their seriousness does not always last. When we are in the spiritual life, we have to take ourselves seriously and we have to take God seriously at every moment. When we take God seriously, we do everything for God. At first we say, "I am doing this because I want to see God." Then we see that it is not we, but God Himself who is doing everything in and through us. God will do everything for us, but before He does something, since God is a Gentleman, in silence He asks us, "Can I do this for you?" If we say "Yes, I would be very happy if You would," then He will do it.</p>
<p>Each individual has God inside him; each individual has Divinity, Truth and Light. When he has realised the Highest, each individual will realise that God's Vision is nothing but Wisdom-Light. God created the world with His inner Vision and this Vision is all Wisdom. Wisdom is not mere talk, Wisdom is not cleverness; Wisdom is something else. Believe it or not, Wisdom is Compassion. God's Wisdom and God's Compassion are the same thing. Because of His Compassion, today God is using His Wisdom for us. And because of His Wisdom, today God is using His Compassion for us. When we listen to the inner call, we receive God's Compassion and grow into God's Wisdom.</p>
<p>Here we are all at the United Nations. The United Nations is the offspring of the League of Nations, President Wilson got an inner call, and from his inner call he tried and cried, cried and tried to have world union, union of the world forces. Now this League of Nations has become a world body. We call it the United Nations. The United Nations also has a call, an inner call. The outer call we see when something happens. The United Nations gets a call from a suffering country, from a country that needs help, or a call from the strong countries that want to be of help in creating a peaceful world.</p>
<p>But the inner call the U.N. has already got. That inner call is from the soul and not from the body. It does not come from the geography of the world or the history of the world; it comes from the cry, the inner cry of the world. The geography of the world will say one thing about the U.N., history will say something else about the U.N. and the inner cry will say something else. The living inner cry says that the role of the U.N. is to serve, not men as such, not the world as such, but the cry that is inside the world, the cry that is inside each human being, inside each individual on earth.</p>
<p>An inner call comes to awaken us, to illumine us. It tells us that just because God the infinite Truth and God the infinite Light is inside us, for that reason we are trying and crying and hoping to become inseparably one with God. We use the term "hoping" because we do not know how much faith we have: faith not only in Peace, Light and Bliss, but also faith in ourselves. When we have sincere faith in ourselves, we come to see the Source of that faith. We see that faith comes from the Supreme, from the highest Absolute. If we know that we have a Source which has boundless Peace, Light and Bliss for us, then we can go forward always. But we have to have faith that we can and shall move forward, precisely because we have a Source that is more than willing to lead us forward to the ever-transcending Vision-World and Reality-World. If it is from the inner call that we make a choice, then it is from the inner call that we move forward, and it is from the inner call that we eventually realise the Highest. Then after we realise the Highest, we feel that if anything remains unillumined anywhere on earth, then the main purpose of realisation, which is satisfaction, we can never achieve. Everything must be illumined and perfected. Only then can we have real satisfaction. So we go from call to choice, from choice to destination and from the destination to more inner aspiration for the ever-transcending Goal. And this happens only when we do not turn back. The road is a one way road.</p>
<p>Again and again, I wish to tell you that here we are all seekers. A seeker is not a human being who is half animal. He is more than that. A seeker is one who has glimpsed the light. Otherwise, he could not have become a seeker. This light is more than eager to expand itself into boundless, infinite Light provided we follow the inner call. If we don't follow it, if we don't have faith in it, then our inner light gets hidden or extinguished by the desire forces, the suspicion forces, the doubt forces, the temptation forces, the frustration forces and all the other negative forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">On a birthday</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="On a birthday" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Each birthday is a new awakening. Each birthday is a new hope. Each birthday is a new promise. Each birthday is a new fulfilment.</p>
<p>The new awakening takes place in our physical, earth-bound consciousness. The new hope dawns in our frustrated, disappointed and unaspiring vital. The new promise comes inside our doubtful human mind. This new promise challenges the doubting, doubtful mind and reminds the mind of its origin: consciousness-flood. The new fulfilment occurs inside the entire being: In the earth-bound being and the Heaven-free being.</p>
<p>When the soul descends to earth, the soul takes responsibility not only for the earth-consciousness but also for the Heaven-consciousness. The earth-consciousness cries for light, cries for peace, cries for love, cries for delight. The soul promises the earth-consciousness that it will help it achieve peace, light, love, delight, joy, harmony and everything that the earth-consciousness needs. Again, it is the same soul that promises the Heaven-consciousness that it will manifest Heaven's joy satisfaction and perfection here on earth.</p>
<p>Each birthday is a tune, a melody of the universal music. Each individual is also a melody of the universal music. The seeker grows and glows in this music, which he can hear with his soulful ears. The very presence of the soul-child inside us is what grants us a taste of the universal music. The soul needs to climb like music, soulful music. The soul, when it climbs, knows no boundaries, no religious barriers, no political boundaries. It is all freedom, freedom within and freedom without.</p>
<p>Each birthday is a petal of a flower. The flower, petal by petal, blossoms and then it is ready to be placed at the inner shrine in the aspiring heart.</p>
<p>A thought indicates a new birthday. An iota of will indicates a new birthday. An upward movement indicates a new birthday. At every moment, whether we look within or without, we celebrate the birthday of our oneness with God, the Creator of the entire universe. When we look at something, we become one with it. On a birthday we feel our inseparable oneness with the expansion of a new light, a light that will ultimately cover the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>The real birthday does not come only once a year. The real birthday is the birth of each second in a seeker's life. An aspiring second in the seeker's heart is the real birthday. At every moment, God the Author of all good celebrates the seeker's birthday. As seekers we have to be consciously aware of something divine and supreme within us. What this divine and supreme thing is is our promise to humanity and our promise to divinity. The transformation of humanity's face is our soul's promise to humanity and the manifestation of divinity's light here on earth is our soul's promise to divinity.</p>
<p>It is our Devadip's Birthday. As I have spoken about the soul in connection with music, I wish to dedicate this very short talk to the sublimely great musician-soul inside Devadip. Some of you know him as Carlos Santana, while others know him as Devadip, the Lamp of God, the Vision, the Light of the Supreme.</p>
<p>[/To Devadip Carlos Santana:/] The United Nations is an international body. You play music all over the world with your soul's love for mankind. May the soul of the United Nations bless you. May the soul of the United Nations grant you its inner peace, inner love, inner joy, inner oneness with the rest of the world. Your dedicated service of joy, love and peace you offer to the world. The soul of the United Nations, therefore, offers its most blessingful love to you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tribute To Dag Hammarskjold</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Tribute To Dag Hammarskjold" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We wish to offer our soulful hommage to this great soul and also we invoke this great soul to bless us in our life of inner aspiration and our life of outer dedication. [A short meditation followed.] Dag Hammarskjold was a great man, a good heart, a soulful life, a possessor of perfect vision-light. Something more, he became a fulfilling bridge between humanity's excruciating pangs and divinity's illumining Compassion.</p>
<p>They say that the mind's brilliance and the heart's oneness do not and cannot go together, because the mind tends to enjoy a sense of separativity. But Dag Hammarskjold's life amply proved that the mind's brilliance and the heart's oneness can and do go together. They say that the selfless purity of the body and the bold dynamism of the vital usually do not run abreast. Indeed, Dag Hammarskjold was a rare exception.</p>
<p>They say that there is a yawning gulf between earth's practical reality-body and Heaven's theoretical vision-soul. If what they say is true, then it is also unmistakably true that Dag Hammarskjold bridged that yawning gulf in his own life's short span</p>
<p>The practical man in Dag Hammarskjold teaches us, "Do not look back, and do not dream about the future, either. Your duty, your reward, your destiny, are here and now."</p>
<p>The theoretical soul in Dag Hammarskjold teaches us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The moon was caught in the branches. Bound by its vow, My heart was heavy.</p>
<p>Naked against the night The tree slept. Nevertheless, Not as I will....</p>
<p>The burden remained mine: They could not hear my call And all was silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Religion-blood Dag Hammarskjold inherited from his sweet mother. Manifestation-flood he inherited from his dear father. Something more he inherited from his father: loneliness. Both father and son were assailed by loneliness.</p>
<p>The divine seeker in the Secretary-General left a special message for those who are married to inescapable loneliness: "Didst Thou give me this inescapable loneliness so that it would be easier for me to give Thee all?"</p>
<p>A great man is, indeed, a great power. Human power cleverly avoids justification. Divine power does not avoid justification for there is no need on its part to do so. It knows that justification is only another name for its selfsame reality. The Secretary-General's wisdom-light reveals to us, "Only he deserves power who everyday justifies it."</p>
<p>We desire many things. Sometimes we do not know what we desire and why we desire. Unlike us, God has only one desire: independence. And that independence, too, is only for us. The seeker in Dag Hammarskjold not only tells us about God's desire for us, but also tells us when we can attain it: "God desires our independence, which we attain when, ceasing to strive for it ourselves, we 'fall' back into God."</p>
<p>Dag Hammarskjold was a man of unparalleled duty. Duty demands capacity. He perfectly mastered the art of duty. Out of his heart's magnanimity, he shares with us its quintessence: "Somebody placed the shuttle in your hand. Somebody who had already arranged the threads."</p>
<p>The seeker's life need not always be a bed of roses. Sometimes it can ruthlessly be a bed of thorns. When the seeker Dag Hammarskjold's inner crisis loomed large, his frustration-life voiced forth: "What I ask for is unreasonable — that life shall have a meaning. What I strive for is impossible — that my life shall acquire a meaning."</p>
<p>Again, when the same seeker's life-tree blossomed into a glorious satisfaction, he immediately and unreservedly voiced forth,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That chapter is closed. Nothing binds me.</p>
<p>Beauty, goodness, In the wonders here and now Become suddenly real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time I go to the Secretary-General's birth-place, Uppsala, Sweden, I make it a special point to offer my soulful homage to his Long Home. His life's sterling simplicity illumines my life of aspiration and his soul's ever-glowing luminosity fulfils my life of dedication.</p>
<p>A flying earth-plane killed his body, only to help his soul fly to reach the highest height. But his Heaven-bound flying soul got the immediate opportunity to see the Face of the Beloved Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Emotion: is it our enemy or our friend?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Emotion: is it our enemy or our friend?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Emotion is both our foe and our friend. There are many planes of consciousness, but usually we deal with two planes of consciousness: the physical and the spiritual. On the physical plane, emotion and the very outset is sweet, sweeter, sweetest. Then there comes a time when this emotion is followed by frustration and frustration is followed by destruction. Why does it happen so? It happens so precisely because the emotion that is in play in the physical proper is still unlit, unillumined and impure. On the physical plane emotion is nothing short of self-exposition, either consciously or unconsciously, either under compulsion or at one's own sweet will.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of emotion in the spiritual plane, in our heart or psychic existence. Here the emotion is constantly self-illumining and God-fulfilling. In the spiritual world, in the inner world emotion is truth-expansion, divinity-expansion and perfection-manifestation. Naturally we can also add 'God-satisfaction', for God-satisfaction can loom large only in truth-expansion and divinity-expansion and perfection-manifestation.</p>
<p>On the human plane there are quite a few undivine forces that attack us and eventually compel us to surrender or resort to anger, anxiety, worries, attachment, self-pity and self-immolation.</p>
<p>Anger: what is it, after all? Anger is a force that does not permit us to be consciously aware of our oneness-reality with others, who are our extended, expanded reality. When anger assails us we not only forget our existence-reality, our oneness-reality with others, but we try to destroy or we actually do destroy our oneness-reality.</p>
<p>Now, how do we conquer anger? A spiritual Master will tell us to make our mind calm and quiet and to pray and meditate on God. Then we will be able to free ourselves from the wild anger in us.</p>
<p>The advice of the spiritual Master is absolutely correct. But if we want to conquer anger on the spot, then the easiest and the most effective way is to repeat God's Name as fast as possible each time we breathe in. The first time we breathe in we can repeat ten times, "God, God, God." And the second time we breathe in, if inside each time we say "God" we can mentally visualise or count God's name twenty times more, then the power of anger almost totally vanishes.</p>
<p>Lack of poise, lack of mental equanimity, is anger. How do we attain poise? How do we achieve mental equanimity? We achieve mental equanimity when we live not in the mind but somewhere else. And where is that place? It is in the heart.</p>
<p>The mind that doubts, the mind that is subject to anxiety, worries, suspicion and attachment cannot give us poise, cannot give us clarity and vision. It is the heart, the aspiring heart that has already established its constant and conscious oneness with the soul that can give us poise. And this poise that we get from the heart can easily be brought into the suspicious, doubtful, arrogant, unlit, unillumined mind. And once the poise of the heart, which is founded upon the soul's light, is brought into the human mind, which is immersed in the gross physical, the mind is bound to be illumined slowly, steadily and unerringly.</p>
<p>What is poise? Poise is a kind of divine emotion in us. But it is anything but excitement. This poise we get when we identify ourselves with the Infinite, the Eternal, the Immortal.</p>
<p>Fear is another kind of emotion which plays its role only in separating us from our vast oneness-reality. Doubt also practically does the same. When fear plays its role, we either unconsciously or consciously separate our existence from the Vastness itself. When doubt plays its role, we unconsciously shorten our own reality-existence. We minimise our consciousness, our own experience and realisation of reality.</p>
<p>Attachment is a form of emotion. As attachment is a form of emotion, so also is detachment a form of emotion. When there is attachment, we immediately notice that there is a constant tug-of-war between two armies.</p>
<p>Attachment binds us for our own gratification. Attachment makes us feel that no individual is complete. It makes us feel that only in the unification of two individuals — no matter whether it is on the physical plane, vital plane or mental plane — will the two individuals derive satisfaction. But this feeling is incorrect. The human in us is right now half-animal. The animal consciousness in us quite often plays its role most powerfully. So when two people use attachment as a magnet or pull each other, quite often destruction plays its role.</p>
<p>Detachment is also a form of emotion. On the outer plane we may feel there is no emotion involved. Unfortunately this conception of ours is built on air. No, detachment is also a form of emotion. Detachment is not indifference; detachment is our true existence, the existence that lives in reality proper — either in Heaven-reality or in earth-reality. Detachment is emotion, only it is not affected by the happenings, incidents and experiences of the reality that it is seeing; it is always an inch higher in consciousness. Although it may remain on the earth plane, in earth's multifarious activities, it keeps its consciousness higher than the reality where the experiences or incidents are taking place.</p>
<p>Although a seeker is detached, that doesn't mean he is indifferent. He sees and experiences the reality that is apt to threaten him and frighten him, the reality that quite often belittles his capacity, his potentiality and even his own existence and Immortality. But the seeker does not let this affect him. He feels there is only one reality in him and that reality is God-Reality. This God-Reality he can feel, he can experience no matter where he is, provided he knows the supreme art of focusing all his attention on one object or subject: God.</p>
<p>Sincerity and insincerity: these are also emotions. With sincerity we fly, fly in the vast, uncharted sky. With insincerity we enter into a tiny cave in order to escape. With sincerity we try to spread our wings and give to the world what we have and what we are. With insincerity we hide our reality-world which we claim to be only ours.</p>
<p>Purity and impurity. Purity is our self-expansion and impurity is our self-immolation. With each purity-breath we breathe in, we increase our God-Reality. And with each impurity-breath we breathe in, we surrender our very existence to the jaws of death.</p>
<p>Sincerity and purity are the two divine attributes that all the seekers can apply to their day-to-day activities. Emotion has to be disciplined sincerely in the mind proper. When the mind becomes sincere, then the mind opens itself consciously, devotedly and soulfully to the Vastness. At that time, the multiple encouraging, inspiring experiences of the world descend from above through the mind and prepare for the universal opening to the transcendental heights.</p>
<p>Purity is of the heart and in the heart, but for the soul. The soul is the conscious representative of God within us. The heart of purity is the heart that consciously discovers God. The heart of purity is conscious God-revelation and God-manifestation.</p>
<p>Ultimately all our emotions give way to tears, either to earthly tears or to heavenly tears. Earthly tears are the outcome of depression, frustration and lack of fulfilment. Heavenly tears are the tears of gratitude offered to the Source, to the Supreme Beloved, the Inner Pilot, the Eternal Friend.</p>
<p>We start our journey with earthly tears because this is what we get when we walk along the road of desire. But there comes a time when we discover that the road we are walking upon will never lead us to our destination. Then we change our road. We start walking along another road, the road of realisation. When we walk along this road, each day, each hour, each minute, each second we feel we are approaching our cherished destination. Here the tears that we experience are divine tears composed of our unalloyed love for God and flowing from our heart-flower of gratitude.</p>
<p>With earthly tears we start our journey. But this journey does not satisfy us; it cannot lead us to our destination. So we resort to heavenly tears, which come from our heart's gratitude and true love of God. When we become heavenly tears, we not only start our journey properly but also we hasten our true Truth-realisation and God-revelation which is Beauty-revelation, God-manifestation and Bliss-manifestation for earth.</p>
<p>Emotion that says, "I came, I saw, I conquered," is a destructive emotion, an animal emotion in us. Emotion that says, "I came, I loved, I became," is divine emotion, illumined emotion, fulfilled emotion-perfect, all-illumining, all-fulfilling emotion.</p>
<p>"I am for myself" is either the animal emotion in me or the human emotion in me. "I am for my Reality-Source, for my Reality-God" is a divine emotion. I see the Truth just because the Truth wants to see in and through me. I become the Truth just because the Truth reveals itself in and through me. Then I am inundated with divine emotion, which is conscious and constant love of God and awareness of God: Truth-expansion, God-manifestation and man-and-God-satisfaction.</p>
