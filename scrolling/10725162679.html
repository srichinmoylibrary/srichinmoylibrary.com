<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only think of the first day that you saw me. When you came to New York and saw me for the first time, you experienced such joy that perhaps you thought that either you had realised God or you were about to realise God. That was the experience. Every day when you look at my Transcendental picture, try to have the same type of experience. Feel that you are seeing someone whom you have known eternally in the heart of your heart. Every day try to have that feeling of newness with the everlasting Reality which you experienced three years ago. One who realises God is at once most ancient and ever new. So, while you look at the Transcendental picture, if you can feel the same thrill, the same joy, the same aspiration, then easily you will be able to maintain your standard. The aspiration is not actually the same, for here we believe in the process of self-transcendence. But you have to start with the joy that you got the first time you saw me in my highest meditation, and from there you transcend, transcend.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Feel that the day you do not aspire, inside you somebody literally dies. What dies is the most beautiful child which you call the soul. Forget about the philosophy that says the soul never dies. Take the soul as something tangible, a little child, a little plant. If you don’t water the plant inside you every day, the plant dies. Or, if you don’t feed the child every day, he becomes weak and dies. If you don’t pray and meditate, then the soul is not getting nourishment. On yesterday’s food you cannot exist; on yesterday’s meditation you cannot exist. So, if you love the soul, every day you shall pray and meditate. Your love for the soul itself is your aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the world aspiring more today than in the past?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the world aspiring more today than in the past?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world is undoubtedly aspiring more than it did, say, at the end of the nineteenth century. But if we say that the world is aspiring more now than it did four thousand or five thousand years ago, then we are making a mistake. The world is progressing on the material plane. Mechanically and scientifically the world has progressed like anything. But spiritually there is a wave-like movement; it goes up and then it goes down.</p>
<p>America is the world for us. There is no other world. When we think of the Western world, immediately we think of America, just as when we say Asia, immediately we think of India. India is not Asia, but Asia takes the credit for India’s spirituality. Similarly, America is not the Western world, but when we say America, immediately we think of the whole modern world. Aspiration in the last fifteen or twenty or fifty years has undoubtedly increased in comparison to what existed two hundred or three hundred years ago, especially in America. Without the least possible hesitation, I can say that America’s inner cry has abundantly increased. But again, the scientific mind, the doubtful mind, has also increased. Positive forces and negative forces have both increased.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago America had a kind of aspiration. Then, some spiritual Masters came from India and the aspiration increased. True, some undivine Masters gave you people counterfeit coins, false coins. But you didn’t know that they were false coins. You thought that they were real coins, so you ran after them. Then, a day came when you said, “No, these are false coins.” Your eagerness to grab the coins was your aspiration. Unfortunately, they were false coins. But the eagerness you had to get the coins, your aspiration or love of Truth or love of God, was already kindled. Then, some good Masters came and the problem was solved.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you work in an office. Even while you are writing out the bills or doing correspondence, you can think of your mother or father. Your hand is doing one thing, but your heart is doing something else. The hand and mind are writing down the proper address, the proper name and so on, but the heart is with your near and dear ones.</p>
<p>So here also, even when I am not physically present, you can feel me inside your heart. The child is playing in the living room and the mother is in the kitchen. The child does not have to see his mother all the time, because he feels her presence inside his heart. So, if you can all the time think of me and feel me in the innermost depths of your heart, then easily you can keep the glow that I bring when I am with you in the physical.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do you get joy out of doing something you don’t like?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do you get joy out of doing something you don’t like?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is called the supreme sacrifice. How can one get the greatest joy? Not by possessing, but by sacrificing. If I have ten dollars and just keep it inside my pocket, I will get one kind of joy. It is the joy of a shylock. But if I can give away the ten dollars, that is a supreme sacrifice. If a thing is done in my own way, naturally I will get joy. But always I have to ask myself, “Am I a beggar that I will only get joy from one particular thing?” A beggar only gets joy in one particular way: if somebody gives him alms or food. But you are not a beggar. So, every time you have to ask yourself, “Am I a beggar that I can get joy only by pleasing myself the way I want to be pleased?”</p>
<p>Your soul’s name is Nirvik; it means indomitable, fearless. If you hate to do a particular thing, and if this hatred keeps you from doing that thing, it means that your hatred has more power than your own indomitable capacity. So, you are the loser there. Hatred is one reality and fearlessness is another. But you cannot allow your fearlessness to surrender to your hatred. When Ali and Norton fight together, then we see who wins. So here also, hatred is a boxer and you yourself are a boxer. Hatred itself is a power, a negative power. And that negative power is fighting with your own quality of fearlessness. So, you have to defeat your enemy.</p>
<p>There are two ways to make yourself happy. One way is to run away and hide. You don’t want to be seen. You don’t want to be affected. The other way is to act like a roaring lion and fight. You tell this hatred, “You have come. All right, let me devour you with my roaring!” If everything is done in your own way, then the result will be very limited, very limited. “In your own way” means that you will try something for one second and then run. Today you will give up one thing because it is too difficult. Tomorrow you will give up another thing because that is too difficult. But everything is difficult. Life itself is difficult.</p>
<p>But if you do everything in God’s Way, then you don’t give up. Always you have to fight. Always you have to conquer, but not in the way that Caesar or Napoleon conquered. Caesar conquered and Napoleon conquered by seeing others’ reality as totally different from their own reality. But you won’t see it in that way. They thought that whoever did not see eye to eye with them was their enemy. But you will say that whoever does not see eye to eye with you is part and parcel of your own reality. If you are unable to feel your oneness with him, then it is a failing on your part. God is omniscient, God is omnipresent, God is everything precisely because He is one with everything and everybody.</p>
<p>So you have to take it as a challenge. Always you have to try to conquer your lower qualities and lower capacities and transform them into your higher qualities and capacities. At one particular place you are pure; at another place you are impure. While walking along the street you have stepped into a mudhole. Right up to the knee it is all dirt, filth, mud, clay. But from the knee upward, it is all clean. Now, if you say, “Oh, I am dirty, filthy, impure; so let me cut off my leg from the knee,” then you won’t be able to walk. You have only to clean the leg and purify it. Similarly, when you see hatred as part of your existence, you try to transform and illumine it. If you can feel that hatred is also part and parcel of your reality, but that it is something which needs improvement, purification and perfection, then easily you can conquer it. You feel that it is an insufficiency, a weakness, a shortcoming, a limitation in yourself, and not a reality apart from your own reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are forced to work every day with unaspiring people, you can maintain your high aspiration in the same way that the best student in the class manages to study with bad students. The best student knows that he has a goal. He has to learn his lesson thoroughly, he has to please his teacher, he has to be inundated with knowledge-light; whereas the bad students are either totally ignorant of these things or they do not care for these things. Similarly, while you are working with unaspiring people, you have to give all your attention to your inner life of aspiration. You have to feel that your life of aspiration has a definite goal: realisation of the highest Absolute.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No doubt, it is a difficult task to maintain intense aspiration while you are involved in multifarious outer activities, but it is not an impossible task. If you become an absolutely sincere seeker, then no matter where you are or with whom you are, you are bound to feel an inner cry. This inner cry can and will become constant if your heart is nothing but sincerity and purity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want aspiration to be paramount in your next incarnation, you can be sure to regain it at an early age only by concentrating and meditating on your next incarnation. But my advice to all of you is this: the present is more than enough to give you what you desperately need. Don’t brood on the past, which is dust. Again, don’t build castles in the air about the future. Aspiration tries and cries to achieve everything here and now. Don’t think of leaving anything for the next incarnation.</p>

As a child needs outer guidance from his parents, even so you need inner guidance from the eternal Father Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can a family aspire?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can a family aspire?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A family can aspire the same way that a tree aspires. A tree aspires with its branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. As each branch, each leaf, each flower and each fruit has an intense desire to please man, even so each member of the human family can develop a strong desire to please God the Source. This desire to please God is nothing short of man’s aspiration.</p>

How can I keep my aspiration ever strong and growing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes I feel that my aspiration drops just after it has been very strong. How can I keep my aspiration ever strong and growing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is by constant, sincere effort that you can maintain a strong and growing aspiration. This effort has to be founded on unconditional self-giving to the Inner Pilot. If you can give yourself unconditionally to the Inner Pilot, then without fail you will have very strong and ever-growing aspiration.</p>
