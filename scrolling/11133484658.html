<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can constantly feel that you are a warrior fighting on my side against ignorance provided you remember the inner assurance that I have repeatedly made to you. I have repeatedly offered you the inner assurance that your victory and my victory is not our victory, but the Victory of our Beloved Supreme. Him to please in His own way, we who are in this boat have come into the world. At every moment, if you can think that He is not only your journey's Goal, but also your journey's Start and Course, then you will easily feel that you are a warrior fighting on my side against ignorance-night.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the so-called Garden of Eden still exist?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the so-called Garden of Eden still exist?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, in the soul's world, in Heaven, there is a place we call the Garden of Eden. The Garden of Eden started long, long ago — far beyond our imagination's beginning. It started as one place, but then it became many. Now it is like a bank which has many branches bearing the same name. I can see that there are at least eleven places that we can call the Garden of Eden. Usually the branches of a bank are not as large or as effective as the main bank. But in this case, the branches — which means the ones that came into being later on — have the same qualities, same capacities, same beauty, same spontaneity, same reality and same divinity as the original Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some spiritual Masters who have their own, let us say ashrams or communities in Heaven. We call them Lokas. Traditionally there are a few Lokas associated with the cosmic gods of the highest order. Again, Sri Rama, Sri Krishna, Sri Ramakrishna and other Masters of the highest order have their own worlds. Each Master of the highest order has his own Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>This Garden of Eden gives satisfaction-delight in the will-world, in the compassion-world and in the oneness-world. Very good question.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tolerance and patience are not the same thing; they are entirely different. Patience is a divine quality. It is the strengthening and lengthening of our capacity. Patience knows that there is a past, a present and a future, but it keeps the future reality, which is eternal love, right in front of its vision.</p>
<p>But tolerance is entirely different. We tolerate something because we are under compulsion. If we don't tolerate something, then the anger or frustration we will get will be more destructive than the thing itself. We tolerate something on the physical or vital plane, feeling that if we don't tolerate it, then the consequences will be most devastating. So tolerance is a good quality only in the sense that something is better than nothing. In tolerance there is always a sense of cleverness, or you might even call it wisdom. You are trying to avert some future calamity, so you tolerate something. But patience is a positive, conscious illumination of our self-giving and world-embracing capacity. Patience infinitely more important than tolerance.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme wants not one but two supreme qualities in order to be satisfied at every moment. These two qualities are an obedience-life and a gratitude-heart: cheerful obedience and soulful gratitude. If you are obedient, then you will realise that there is something momentous that you have to perform on earth for the Supreme; and if you are grateful, then you will feel not only that you have the capacity to please the Supreme in His own way but also that you are doing it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When sweetness is lacking, politeness should be encouraged. When politeness is lacking, sincere self-expression is to be encouraged. In order to acquire sweetness, one can mix with children for a few minutes a day. No matter how restless a child is, his spontaneous sweetness is bound to come to the fore. The seeker doesn't have to talk to the child. Just by observing the spontaneous quality of the child, which is sweetness, one can acquire sweetness.</p>
<p>Sweetness is of great importance in the spiritual life. So try to mix with children. When you mix with children, automatically your own childlike heart comes forward. A childlike heart embodies many divine qualities, and the quality of sweetness is foremost.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fortunately it does not. To be very frank with you, nothing — nothing at all — can affect the quality of my paintings. But if a disciple is aspiring sincerely and devotedly, then the aspiration-flood that I bring down can intensify, purify, elevate and illumine his aspiration.</p>
<p>Sometimes the disciples sit around me and in front of me with the lowest possible aspiration. If that lowest possible aspiration could affect the quality of my paintings, then my paintings would be worse than the worst. But my paintings are far above the disciples' aspiration-capacity.</p>
<p>But if the disciples aspire while I am painting and dive deep within, then they get more joy from my creation. Their high aspiration helps them to identify themselves with the essence and substance of my own aspiration or realisation which the painting embodies.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Each second the Supreme fulfils Himself in a specific way. At one particular second He may like His Compassion-aspect infinitely more than His Power-aspect or His other aspects. At that moment, if my disciples sing most soulfully the songs that deal with compassion, then definitely these songs will please Him most. Similarly, if He wants to manifest the Power-aspect on earth more than any other aspect at a particular second, then if the disciples sing most powerfully the songs that I have written on power, these will please Him most. So it entirely depends on the Supreme's own Consciousness as it deals with the Supreme's own earth-bound and Heaven-free Time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you become proud when you wear your Attendant's uniform, then your consciousness is bound to descend. But while wearing your uniform, if you feel that you are getting an added opportunity to remind yourself of your unreserved devotedness to the Will of the Supreme, then your consciousness is bound to ascend and receive ever-increasing and ever-illumining light.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you use imagination to help your inspiration, you are bound to feel a kind of joy inside your heart. This joy is like the vast sky or the vast sea; it is like the joy of silence. But when you are fooling yourself, at that time you get a vital joy, a vital pleasure, which is a restlessness that percolates through your entire body.</p>
<p>So it is very easy to know whether it is inspiration assisted by imagination or whether you are fooling yourself in the name of inspiration, assisted by mental hallucination. When you are fooling yourself, you feel tremendous restlessness and a continuous flow of thoughts. These thoughts may not at all help you; they are often contradictory and destructive thoughts. A particular thought will lift you up one moment and the next moment that very thought will bring you down. But when it is pure inspiration assisted by pure imagination, then you will feel a continuous flow of your life-river-an inspiration-river or aspiration-river flowing in and through you. Then afterwards, you will feel that that flow is your true reality. And if you go deeper, then you are bound to feel a vast sky or a vast sea inside you. When you embody a vast sea or a vast sky, naturally you will feel tremendous joy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most magical word is gratitude. The most magical thing is to offer one's gratitude to the Supreme for what He has granted to you and not granted to you, out of His infinite Bounty, in order to fulfil His own Dream-Reality in and through you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Expectation is not a bad thing, but if expectation does not meet with satisfaction, then the seeker may experience inner frustration. This frustration is most damaging. But if the seeker goes beyond expectation, then he is bound to see or feel an inner smile each time he offers me his soulful, devoted and unreserved, if not unconditional, service.</p>
<p>As soon as you do something for me, you are bound to see and feel an inner smile. This inner smile is not only the recognition of what you have done but also my assurance that I shall grant you more opportunities and provide you with more capacity so that you can please the Supreme in me more and thus become closer to me. The human in us expects, but the divine in us already has that very thing on the strength of its oneness-will with God's ever-blossoming and ever-transcending Reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You do serve me soulfully quite often. But in order to serve me soulfully all the time, two things you have to do. On the inner plane you have to develop a conscious awareness of what pleases me most. What pleases me most on the inner plane is a gratitude-heart. You do have gratitude, but this gratitude has to be increased at every moment. The expansion of gratitude is of paramount importance in every seeker's life. That is the first thing you have to do. Then, on the outer plane, every day, every hour, every minute you have to consciously feel that you exist on earth only to please your Guru in his own way. This line has to be repeated time and again: "I exist only to please my Guru in his own way." If you can do this, then at every moment you will be able to serve the Supreme in me, not only soulfully, but most soulfully; not only devotedly, but most devotedly; not only unreservedly, but most unreservedly and, finally, unconditionally.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I meditate with soulful intensity without pulling the divine forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I meditate with soulful intensity without pulling the divine forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can meditate with soulful intensity without pulling the divine forces provided you can make your meditation spontaneous. The runner runs the fastest not when he is intense but when his whole body is coordinated and he is relaxed. Intensity here means tension. When it is a matter of pulling and pushing, he cannot run fast.</p>
<p>When intensity is used to push or pull the divine force, then it creates tremendous problems and progress comes to a halt. But while you are meditating, if your meditation becomes intense, that is a good thing. While meditating, if you can have a spontaneous feeling of self-giving to the Inner Pilot, the Supreme Pilot, then your meditation will automatically become intense. And this intensity is not harmful; on the contrary, it is the beginning and blossoming of a new inner dawn in your spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is the one who does the most selfless service the best disciple?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is the one who does the most selfless service the best disciple?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As I said before, one may do twenty, forty or fifty hours of selfless service a week, but the consciousness may be very, very low. If the consciousness is in the gutter during selfless service, then that selfless service is of no avail. The best disciple is the one who does not only selfless service, but unconditional service. Unconditional service does not mean only to work on the physical plane. Service can be on the physical plane, the vital plane, the mental plane and the psychic plane. The person who does unconditional service on all the planes is the best disciple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of you do not know what the vital plane is, what the mental plane is, what the psychic plane is. You pay attention only to selfless service on the physical plane. But I wish to say that selfless service can be on all the planes. If you are washing dishes or guarding me, then you are executing the Will of the Supreme on the physical plane. And if you offer your good will or if you have a very high, sublime meditation, then on the inner plane you are executing the Will of the Supreme. Undoubtedly, that is also selfless service. Anything that you do to become soulfully one, devotedly one, unreservedly one, unconditionally one with the Will of the Supreme is selfless service.</p>
<p>If you can do the highest form of meditation on the psychic plane, mental plane and vital plane, then you are doing the best form of selfless service. Again, if you do unconditional selfless service on the physical plane, then you are getting the result of the highest meditation. There is no difference between the highest form of selfless service and the highest form of meditation. If you can soulfully, spontaneously and unconditionally do either meditation or selfless service, you will gain the same.</p>
<p>You have to know your own capacity, your highest in selfless service and your highest in meditation. If you do selfless service most soulfully and devotedly according to your capacity, then that is your highest. You have to compare your meditation and your selfless service with your own standard, not with somebody else's. Then you will make the best progress. But if you all the time look around to see who is doing the best service or who is doing the best meditation, then you are depriving yourself of the benefit of the selfless service or meditation. Comparison has to be with your own capacity, with your own inner hunger.</p>
