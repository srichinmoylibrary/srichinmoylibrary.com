<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Laws are very simple in Heaven. God says to the souls, "Use as much as possible of My Light. Drink in as much as possible of My Peace. If you want to take part in My Cosmic Game, then you will promise to enter into the world for My Manifestation. And if you don't want to enter into the Cosmic Game, then remain in Heaven in perfect peace and from there help the brave soldiers who want to fight for My Manifestation on earth." These are God's requests, which you can call Laws.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Naturally, if the individual is a seeker, then he has to use his compassion-power and not his justice-power. But again, from the highest point of view, there is no difference between compassion-power and justice-power. Because of his compassion, the genuine seeker does not regard society or other individuals as totally different from his own existence: he feels his oneness with them. Again, if necessity demands, he will try to perfect a situation by using his justice-power. At that time it is not a punishment; it is a supreme necessity for his own total and integral perfection. He claims society and other individuals as his own, very own. So unless and until they are perfect, he feels that perfection is also lacking in his own life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to his understanding, according to his wisdom, according to his illumination and light, if he is one hundred per cent sure that he has done the right thing, then he will not be severely punished. If sincerity looms large in his decision, if he is convinced that he is doing the right thing from the moral point of view, then he will not suffer much because of his mistake. If he is using his own standard of morality as his inner guide, if he is following what he considers to be the voice of his conscience, this may not be the real conscience; but it is the truth that he has so far achieved and embodied. He has not received or become the highest truth, but he is trying to reveal the truth according to his own capacity and his own standard. So, from the Cosmic Law he will have some retribution, but he may not even be aware of it. In his future incarnation he will try to do something and his progress will be hampered; but the punishment or retribution will be very limited. But if he knows that he is not doing the right thing, if he is sentencing the person to die because of outer pressure or because of some other forces, then naturally his punishment in this life or in his next life will be extremely severe. If he deliberately does something that he knows is wrong, then the punishment, without fail, will be very severe.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the strict spiritual point of view, conscience is always infinitely more important than the outer law or manmade law because conscience represents the Light from above. And this Light was already operating long before the outer life came into existence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul will not feel sorry the way a human being feels sorry. It will feel sorry in a divine way. It will feel that an opportunity has been lost on earth. It will feel sorry that it did not get the opportunity to manifest the Divine the way it was supposed to manifest the Divine. But there will not be an iota of worry, anxiety, impatience or grievance, for that is not the way the soul acts. The human vital is always doomed to disappointment when something goes wrong, but the soul embodies patience-light. The soul deals with Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. It knows that it will come back in six years or twenty years or thirty years. Twenty or thirty years, in the soul's case, is like a second. So the soul can wait. It says, "All right, the ignorance-force has destroyed my house, the body. But I am dealing with Eternity."</p>
<p>This is true only if the soul is very mature and if the soul has inner wisdom in boundless measure. But if the soul is not fully mature, and if the soul mixes with the strangling vital, the frustrated vital, then the soul will also suffer. So, you have to know how far away the soul is from the vital, the vital that likes to struggle and fight, the vital that likes the chaos of life. If the soul is very advanced, then it will not be sad, for it knows that in the twinkling of an eye the Supreme will grant it another opportunity. The soul knows that here on earth there are many, many undivine and hostile forces which can act through the judge.</p>
<p>If the world were totally perfect, then the soul would not have this attitude. If the soul saw that everybody was crying for perfection or that everybody had some perfection, then it would say, "Why am I not becoming totally perfect?" But when the soul sees that imperfection looms large everywhere, what can the soul expect? The soul says, "The best thing is to go slowly and steadily, as the human life progresses towards the light."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If he wants to be killed, he has the right in his own way to commit suicide. From the highest point of view, suicide is the worst possible crime. If someone has done something wrong, he has to be very brave. He has to face the consequences and try to illumine himself so that he does not make the same blunder again. That is absolutely the right thing in order to work for perfection. But by killing himself, what is he accomplishing? He will come back in his next incarnation with the same standard, the same attitude towards life, and his perfection will remain a far cry. When someone has done something wrong, he should let the judge decide what is his punishment. He should not take the matter into his own hands and ask for execution. Then, when the punishment is over, let him try to turn over a new leaf so that he can make progress and become a better member of society.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The personal Supreme usually does not interfere. He lets His Justice-Light operate in and through the law. He has already given His Justice-Light to the earth-consciousness, and if He has to interfere, then He is breaking His own Law. On very rare occasions, when He sees that the ignorance-force inside the law or inside the judge is predominant, this may be done. Otherwise, His impersonal aspect, which takes the form of His Justice, is allowed to operate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One does not have to take the case to the Supreme Court to find spirituality. Spirituality can easily be found in the lower courts or in the hands of the lawyers and the judges. Again, we have to know that unspiritual people and a lack of spirituality will always be there at the present stage of evolution.</p>
<p>Spirituality has to start with the individuals who have made the laws and who are going to pronounce the verdict. It is the individual lawyer and judge who have to see the true spirituality inside the case itself. If truth is lacking at the very start of the case, if judges have no light, no wisdom, in the lower court, then it is almost impossible to bring light into the legal system. Only if the root has truth will the trunk and the topmost boughs also have truth. If the roots are lacking in truth, then it is almost impossible to see truth and light in the topmost branches of the reality-tree.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the spiritual point of view, a person is justified in disobeying the law only when he is in direct contact with the Will of the Absolute Supreme. If the Supreme in a particular case sees that a particular man-made law is standing against the inner growth of a sincere seeker, then the Supreme may give His supreme Message to that seeker. At that time, the seeker will undoubtedly abide by the Supreme's Message, which is nothing but the Supreme's own Will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In various countries, especially in India, when children reach the age of thirteen or so, the parents see and feel the functioning of the mind in their children. Before that they saw only the vital impulse and the children made no regular, concentrated effort toward any particular project. But now, although the mind has begun to function in their children, these parents right to the end try to advise, shape and mould their children's lives. They feel that just because they are parents, they have more earthly knowledge than their children. Again, when the children obey their parents, in most cases they don't lose their freedom, for freedom in the ultimate sense is joy. If by obeying their parents they get satisfaction, then that joy is infinitely more valuable than the so-called freedom that is enjoyed by the juvenile world in the West. Here the parents give their children license to do whatever they want to do. But the freedom-joy that some juveniles enjoy is bound to be followed by frustration, which is a common story.</p>
