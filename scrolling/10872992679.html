  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can black people feel more patriotism for America when it has offered them such suffering?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can black people feel more patriotism for America when it has offered them such suffering?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In a family, let us say, there are two brothers. Suppose the white brother is the elder one and the black brother is the younger one. In a family, quite often there is conflict because neither brother is perfect. Naturally the elder one has more strength, so he strikes the younger one and says, "You have to listen to me because I am older and I know better than you." The younger one cries and makes complaints to the father, and the father scolds the older one. The older brother says, "No, no, I am not going to strike him again," but the following day again he strikes his younger brother.</p>
<p>The older brother has not established the feeling of oneness with the younger brother. That is why he will always try to maintain his supremacy. He won't allow his younger brother to compete with him. He will try to minimise the younger one's capacity and in every possible way belittle him, because he feels that if the younger one comes up to the same standard, then he will not be able to dominate him. So the older one tries to negate and deny the younger brother and take away his capacity. He finds this difficult to do, so then he tries to delay the younger one's development. The African nation is a young nation â€” not in the sense that it has received less light, but in this sense: let us say that the light started operating inside the black nation five minutes later, and in the white nation five minutes earlier. It is the same light that has descended, but in the younger nations it has descended a few minutes later. Now the one who received it first does not want the light to enter into the other one. Although he has some light, he is a victim of ignorance. He does not want to be part and parcel of the other one. So he can try to delay the light for two years or three years. But he cannot delay it indefinitely.</p>
<p>The light that descended into the first one is anxious and eager to expand. It wants to expand in the physical and the vital, so that the physical and the vital can have the greatest joy. The light can expand in the physical and the vital by force. "I have entered into you and I am the same light that has entered into him. But just because I have entered you five minutes earlier, you are not allowing me to collect my own reality â€” my reality which is inside him." So if it wishes, the light can force.</p>
<p>But if the light forces, then the physical, the vital and the mind will not get the same joy, the same happiness as they would get if they consciously cooperated with the light and participated in its expansion. Therefore, the light waits until the physical and the vital are ready. It is like a child in a tug-of-war. The child knows that his own capacity is very limited. But when he pulls with four or five members of his family, he gets tremendous joy: firstly, because he has been given the opportunity to be on the team with his father and brothers and, secondly, because when they win he feels their collective strength. At that time, he never feels his own little strength, but only the collective strength â€” the strength of his father, his mother, his brothers. So the light gives the individual, the little child, the opportunity to claim it as his elder brother and strongest member of the family.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the situation from the other side, from the little one's point of view. The little brother is being misunderstood, insulted, beaten in every way. He hates it because he is being mistreated. But at the same time, he appreciates and admires the elder brother's capacity and he hopes that one day he will have the same capacity. And when he goes out and mixes with his friends and neighbours, he will brag about his elder brother. He will tell them: "You, he can beat." Here he is being beaten by the elder brother at home, but then he brags to others that he has such a strong, powerful brother. He does not say that his elder brother is very bad, that he is this and that. No! He is proud of his elder brother. Why? It is because the soul in him has already established a connection with his brother. His soul knows that today the brother is not allowing him to reach the brother's own level, but tomorrow the brother will be compelled to allow him because the Inner Pilot, the Supreme, who is the Father, will not allow the younger one to remain always below.</p>
<p>There is another thing. The younger one does not necessarily have to walk alongside the older one in order to show his equality. There is an order. In a group, God decides that He will keep you one inch taller than your husband, let us say. So you take the lead, because you are taller, and he follows. But just because he is coming one step behind you, it does not mean he is in any way inferior. Two persons are walking, and one is in front and the other is one step behind. Sometimes the taller one takes the lead, sometimes the shorter one. One has got affection, one has got wisdom. To the older one who is taller, God has given the wisdom aspect. So already he is one step ahead. And to the other one, the younger one, God has given the affection aspect. God says, "The little child does not have wisdom right now, so let Me give him My Affection, My Concern. And the big one, since he has got some knowledge, let him go one step ahead." But then God says, "No, I want to give joy to My little one also. So let the little one take the lead and the big one will follow. I am all affection and love for the little one, so let him take the lead and I will see what happens. If he makes any mistake, I will rectify it, I will perfect it."</p>
<p>So, if God created the older brother first and he walks one step ahead, it does not mean that the other one is inferior in God's Eye. It is just that God created a particular creation one second earlier. And if He keeps His Cosmic Law, then the one that He has created first will take the lead â€” not in the sense of being superior but in the sense of creation's flow. From Silence creation started, and in creation there will be a beginning. Then it will spontaneously flow. But all parts of the flow are joined together in the bond of oneness. The younger brother says, "I have been tortured mercilessly. You made me your slave. Why should I feel any oneness with you?" But the older one says, "I have tortured you, true. I have scolded you, insulted you, struck you. I have made you into a slave. But, at the same time, I have given you something of mine. I had a million dollars, and I have given you only ten dollars. And even for that ten dollars you have worked very hard. But if you had stayed with your height, if you had never come to America but stayed in Africa, where would you be now? Just see the difference between Africa's evolution and America's evolution. Right now, America has much more light than Africa." The elder brother has struck and mistreated the younger one in every way. But by mixing with him, the elder brother has unconsciously, let us say â€” not consciously â€” helped the younger brother. The little boxer fights with the big boxer. All the time he loses, since the big boxer is the champion. But just because the young boxer is always fighting with the champion, he is gaining strength.</p>
<p>As long as the boss has accepted me to serve him, there is hope that one day he may give me a higher post. Today I am his slave. But tomorrow he may give me a higher post and the day after tomorrow he will bring me to his own level. He has a little more wisdom, a little more light, than me. If I stay at home with my own capacity, I don't get my salary. The divine thing, true, is for the boss to be kind and good to me. But if he is not, let me be wise. The boss is insulting me, but at the end of the month, he is giving me my salary. So I will save up my salary and after some time I will not have to work there. If I don't have much light, and if I stay in my Indian village, what am I going to gain? But if I become a servant to a powerful man in the city, he may be very bad, but the capacity that he has is my gain. If I don't accept the light that America has, then I don't get anything. And the capacity that the whites have is the capacity of inspiration. It need not be Yoga or anything like that. But their very capacity is a source of inspiration to those with less capacity.</p>
<p>In India, teachers are often merciless and they frequently strike their students. The students may be stronger, but they don't strike back, for they see how much they are gaining. The students feel that if they want to become teachers themselves, then they have to surrender to this kind of mistreatment and punishment. They know that the inspiration they are getting from the achievements of the teacher is more than the ignorance they are getting. Similarly, no matter how strict the spiritual Masters in India are, their students stay. Physical death they are ready to accept at every second, but not spiritual death.</p>
<p>I am not justifying the whites. Far from it. I have to know that the suffering I am going through is nothing in comparison to the thing that I am gaining. I have to know that sometimes I suffer because of my previous karma and sometimes because of the malicious pleasure of my boss. Sometimes it happens that my boss is not so bad, but still he tries to keep me under him so he can lord it over me. But he is a source of inspiration to me â€” not what he is, but what he has. His capacity is my source of inspiration. Suffering is not the end. What we want is the end, and what we want is light.</p>
<p>If I see something in you, it becomes my inspiration, or I get inspired to get that thing myself. You are a beautiful girl. If somebody wants to become beautiful and she sees you, she gets a kind of inspiration. Consciously she may not get even an iota of your beauty. But something that you have actually enters into her in a subtle way. By staying with a beautiful person, we get some of the person's inner beauty. Similarly by staying with someone who has more light than we have, we unconsciously or consciously get some of his light.</p>
<p>Lincoln and others did realise that slavery was wrong. From the beginning they thought it was a mistake to keep the blacks under their jurisdiction. There were those who felt that the blacks were like little children who would misuse their freedom. That is why they didn't want to give them freedom. But Lincoln said, "No, they are mature; they are grown up. They will be able to manage."</p>
<p>My little finger is in no way inferior to my biggest finger. My forefinger is bigger than my little finger, but in order to complete my hand, I need all my fingers. Each finger has its own capacity, and when they join together, the hand is very powerful. If I keep the little one aside and just use the other ones, it will be a mistake. Only when the little one joins the others will I be powerful. A black person is in no way inferior to a white. He who stands one step ahead will never condemn the one who started his journey one second later. They go together. Again, if we want to separate ourselves, we can separate our whole existence. My right foot may become jealous because my left foot is one step ahead of it. But if my right foot realises its oneness with the left, it knows that they are walking together â€” left, right; left, right. The marcher may have started his journey with his left foot, but now his feet are marching together â€” first one, then the other. Just because the journey began with the left foot, we can curse God, we can curse our feet, but that will be absurd.</p>
<p>As we are walking, sometimes the left foot is ahead and sometimes the right foot is ahead. So many black people have made contributions. Men like Martin Luther King, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Jesse Owens â€” there are so many. Is this not one step ahead? Muhammad Ali is ahead. He who won the heavyweight championship is a black. But will America not claim him as its very own to show the world that it is first? If you separate him, he is a black, but if you do not separate him, then he is the son of America to the whole world. It is not a matter of white skin or black skin; it is a matter of heart. Last week I read in the newspaper that Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard. He said that a man's smallness and bigness does not depend on his education; it depends on his heart. If he has a big heart, then he is really big, and if he has a small heart, then he is really small. He could have said that might is right. "Come here and let me show you my strength: one blow is enough." But look at him! He is saying that right is might, that strength lies in the heart's capacity. The Harvard scholars may think that he is an uneducated man. The professors will use the mind, and the silly mind will say, "You are one inch higher, you are one inch lower." The boxer's hand has strength, but because of his heart's strength he is saying that man's greatness lies in his heart's capacity, that right is might. Muhammad Ali ran one step ahead, as did Martin Luther King and Jesse Owens.</p>
<p>Once, in Berlin, Jesse Owens was competing with Germany's Lang in longjump. Each had three chances. In the first two jumps Lang was leading, but then he got a cramp in his leg. Now, look at Jesse Owens' heart's capacity. He went and began to massage Lang's foot to try to save him. It was taking time, so three times a black man went back to massage the leg of a white man, the one who was standing first. Is this not the American heart? Jesse Owens was representing America and he showed the whole world his heart's might. Then when Jesse Owens jumped for the last time, he defeated Lang like anything. Lang died in the second world war. Jesse Owens kept in touch with Lang's son and maintained a lifelong friendship. Every month Jesse Owens used to send him money from America and he supported him for years. Here, Jesse Owens was doing this, but once more he represented the American heart.</p>
<p>Again, Jesse Owens' athletic instructor was a white. He had great love for Jesse Owens and used to bring him food because he was extremely poor. He knew that Jesse Owens had the capacity to become a good student but because he was born in a poor black family, most good schools would not allow him to study there. His teacher fought for Jesse Owens and people listened to him, so Jesse Owens was able to study in good schools and eventually he became the pride of America. Here a white came forward as the American heart. So in our journey one moment our right leg goes forward and the next moment our left leg comes forward.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to get in touch with the source. Right now you see your brothers, black people, at the foot of the tree. They do not know how to climb. So you climb to the top of the tree and pick some mangoes, and then come down and distribute them. The people at the foot of the tree you have accepted as your brothers and sisters. They are hungry also. And because of your heart, you will not allow your little brothers to remain unfed. Now, if you just stay with your brothers at the foot of the tree, then there will not be any mangoes for anyone. So you have to go up the tree and give to others who don't have. And for this you have to go to a higher level.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak of the soul of America and England as it relates to the spiritual life in America?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak of the soul of America and England as it relates to the spiritual life in America?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> America and England wanted to receive light from above through the physical, and not through the heart. They felt that if they received light in the physical, then they would take it from the physical to the vital, from the vital to the mind, and from the mind to the heart. But this process is very unhealthy. The real process, the desirable process, is from the soul to come to the heart, from the heart to the mind, from the mind to the vital and from the vital to the body. It is best to always go from the root to the top of the tree, from the place that has most light to the place that has least light. But if you start in the place with the least light, then what will you have to carry to the other places? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The soul has abundant light, Then, after the soul, the place that is most receptive is the heart. Since the heart is much more receptive than the mind, the light from the soul has to come to the heart. And from the heart it has to come to the mind, vital and body.</p>
<p>The soul is the seed. Gradually, gradually, the seed germinates into a plant. Then it becomes a tree and produces leaves, flowers and fruits. When the soul's light passes through the heart, mind, vital and body, it becomes the complete tree with leaves, flowers and fruits. This is the proper way of dealing with light.</p>

In humans, the soul is in our heart centre. Is there a heart centre for America?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will say it is in Massachusetts and somebody will say it is in Connecticut. In India, in a particular village, the inhabitants have put a mark and said, "This is the heart of India." But just saying that a particular spot is the heart of a country does not mean that place is the heart of the country.</p>
<p>Inside the human being there is a heart; inside the heart is the soul. The consciousness of the soul, the light of the soul permeates the whole body, but most of the time the soul is inside the heart. So like that, definitely there will be a place in America from which the light emanates. It need not be the centre of America in terms of geography. Even in the physical body the heart is not in the centre. But definitely there will be a place where the soul's light can be felt or from where the soul's light can be manifested. And it need not be all the time at the same place. We have to know that since there are fifty states, the soul can easily move around from one state to another. If there is one particular state with a very divine consciousness, then the soul may feel that this is the proper place to stay. If the soul wants peace, peaceful rest, then naturally the soul will go to the state that is quite peaceful. And if it goes to another place where people are quarrelling and fighting, the soul will not like it. It is a very complicated matter. Again, it may happen that some states are leading a very innocent, simple life and not quarrelling or fighting, and the soul of America may feel, "Oh, these are already divine children. They are already inside me. They are not going to do anything wrong. If a tug-of-war takes place, they will pull on my side. They won't go to my enemies and pull me toward that side, no. I don't have to spend my time here any more. Let me go to the states that are quarrelling and fighting let me bring some light. Let me bring my light to the fore there."</p>
<p>So there cannot be any hard and fast rule about where the soul remains. But America's soul, this much I can say, is very dynamic. It does not stay for a long time in any one particular state. It moves around. It is like the mother who has many children. When the children get married and move to different places, the mother moves around visiting them â€” today here, tomorrow there, the day after tomorrow somewhere else. Everywhere she has her own dear ones, and she gets joy in moving from one place to another visiting them.</p>
