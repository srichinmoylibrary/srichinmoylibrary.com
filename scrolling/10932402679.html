  <h2 id="page-title">My adventures with the bank messenger</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My adventures with the bank messenger" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father and Chitta were very strict with me when I went out with the bank messenger on his bicycle. My father did not like me to go at noon because of the heat. He thought that I would become too exhausted. Then Chitta always used to insist that I wear a hat. I never liked hats. But I was the darling of the family and he was worried that I would fall sick.</p>
<p>In spite of their concern, quite often I managed to go out anyway. If they asked me, "Where are you going?" I would say, "I am just going out."</p>
<p>Often one of the bank tellers would let me know when the messenger was leaving. With his eyes he would signal me when it was time for the messenger to go to the various banks, and also he would indicate on which side of the building the messenger was. Then, when I went out, the messenger would be waiting for me.</p>
<p>The messenger was so kind-hearted. His name was Manindra. He was very short and fat. One of his legs was a little shorter than the other, so he used to walk with a limp.</p>
<p>The messenger and I had a special signal that we sometimes used. If he was going in one direction, he would use the special signal to tell me to go in the opposite direction. Then I would say to my father, "I am going to buy sweets," so that my father thought I was going the opposite way from where the messenger was going. When I ran out, my friend the messenger would come and pick me up.</p>
<p>Two or three times, the messenger and I both fell off the bicycle. Once it was absolutely the worst experience. The messenger took me to a place quite far away to get a particular kind of toothstick, which is very bitter. He was pedalling very fast, and small branches along the side of the road were striking me.</p>
<p>When we came to a Punjabi-Sikh colony, something really serious happened. The Punjabi-Sikhs are so tall and stout, with beards and moustaches. Three of them started shouting and screaming. They were shouting at somebody else, but we thought that they were screaming at us. I became frightened and fell off the bicycle. Then the messenger fell on top of me. The three men saw that we were frightened and did not come near us.</p>
<p>I started crying and the messenger became very worried about what would happen to him when my family came to learn of our accident. He knew that my father was very compassionate, but he thought that my aunt would not only scold him, but perhaps also fire him. My uncle, my mother's brother, was the assistant manager of a printing press, and quite often I used to sleep at their house when I stayed in town. My uncle used to call me "Rabbit" because one moment I would be near him, and the next moment I would be somewhere else.</p>
<p>When the messenger and I returned that evening and my father heard the story, he was very sad, but he did not scold me. Then he took me to my aunt's house to spend the night. When she found out what had happened, she was so furious. She had something in her hands and she just threw it on the ground. The next day she came to the bank and insulted and scolded the messenger mercilessly. My brother Chitta also scolded him. That day the messenger took an oath that he would never take me on his bicycle again. But his oath only lasted three or four days!</p>

<p>Adjacent to our bank was another bank called Mahalakshmi, which belonged to someone else. Whenever I sat behind the messenger on his bicycle while he was delivering letters, I would always ask him which bank had more money: our bank, Griha-Lakshmi, or Mahalakshmi. His answer would depend on his mood. On the days that he said our bank had more money, I would be so overjoyed that I would give him candy. But when he said that ours had less, I used to become so sad that I would give him nothing. Quite a few times he told me very seriously that our bank really did not have as much money as Mahalakshmi.</p>
<p>Once I asked my father if this was true. My father said, "No! We have more money. He is just a clerk. What does he know?" I was so happy to hear that.</p>
<p>Chitta overheard our conversation and he was very amused. Then another clerk came over and said, "It is good to say that we have less money. Then there will be no robberies!"</p>
<p>My father said, "All right, if you feel that way, we will be happy to say that. But I wish to tell you that we really do have more money. I am not saying this just to console my son."</p>
<p>After that day, I believed my father and was so proud that our bank had more money.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A slap from my father</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A slap from my father" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Only once did my father ever strike me. When I was six years old I got a slap from him. That was the first and last time. My mother used to slap me quite often, but my father did it only once. I will never forget the incident. Why will I not forget it? Because of a scar on my left wrist.</p>
<p>One Friday evening when my father was back from town, I was bragging that I had learnt how to climb up the mango tree in the garden. He did not believe me, so I wanted to prove that I could do it. I took a big machete and ran into the garden. I wanted to climb up the tree and cut off a small branch from the top to show him.</p>
<p>As soon as I climbed up to the top, the first thing I did was cut a big tendon on my wrist. I started to cry, and the servant who had followed me into the garden climbed up and brought me to my father. My father was always calm and quiet; his soul's quality was peace. But this time he was so upset that he slapped me. Then he told Chitta, Mantu, the servants and the cook to all run and fetch a doctor. There were three or four doctors in the village, so he said, "Whoever finds one of the doctors first, bring him here!" When a doctor came, he said it was not so serious. But my father was upset because I was bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>Never, never did my father get angry with me. All kinds of complaints he used to get from my mother about my behaviour, but he was so indulgent to me and always took my side. He never, never struck me except for that one time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A close escape from death</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A close escape from death" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Once our family was performing the Kali Puja, the festival of Mother Kali. At the time I was about seven years old. Many sacrifices were offered. The most important was the sacrifice of a live goat. Someone would hold the legs of the animal tightly, while the goat's head was placed at the end of the scaffold. For the sacrifice to be successful, the Brahmin priest had to perform it with one stroke of his sharp scimitar. If the priest failed on the first stroke, it was said that the devil's doings would befall the family that was performing the festival.</p>
<p>After the sacrifice of the goat, it was customary that fruits also be sacrificed to Mother Kali. In this case also, to make the sacrifice successful, the priest had to cut these fruits in half with only one stroke of the scimitar. Then he would fling the fruit out to the spectators, and the lucky ones would catch it.</p>
<p>When the time came for the sugar cane sacrifice, it was placed on the scaffold that earlier had held the goat and the fruits. The top portion of the sugar cane has a few leaves and is not edible, but the main body of the sugar cane plant is most delicious. I noticed that some of my friends, who had been standing near the top portion of the sugar cane, had quietly moved around the back of the audience to the other side, so that they could stand near the other end of the altar. They knew that the body of the sugar cane would be flung in that direction.</p>
<p>The priest had grasped the scimitar in both hands and swung it above his head, even extending his hands behind his head in order to get better leverage to perform the job successfully. Just as the priest was beginning to swing, I jumped over the scaffold. In the nick of time, he halted his swing.</p>
<p>A wave of panic swept those who were watching. I had escaped from a great calamity by just a hair's breadth. Had the priest not been able to stop his swing, I would have been in the other world. Fortunately, the divine in the priest had immediately endowed him with the needful life-saving skill.</p>
<p>My father, approaching me in a calm and quiet manner, embraced me with both arms. There was not a trace of worry or anxiety in his face — only tranquil joy streaming forth.</p>
<p>My father then took the priest aside and said, "You have saved my son's life. Whatever reward you want I shall immediately give you — money, property or anything else I have. I shall give it to you here and now."</p>
<p>The priest, still trembling from the experience, said to my father: "Reward! What reward? I have saved my mentor's dearest son! What greater joy can there be on earth than to save my deeply esteemed mentor's youngest son!"</p>

<p>My eldest brother Hriday and my brother Chitta always used to get one hundred out of one hundred in mathematics. They took after my father. My sister Ahana descended to sixty and Mantu to forty. I descended to thirty-three. Fortunately, in the Indian system, thirty-three is passing. Sometimes, with greatest difficulty, I would get forty.</p>
<p>I used to memorise everything in the book, but the teacher would change the questions on the examination day, so my memorisation did not work.</p>
<p>When my brothers were in college, my father used to tell them mathematical equations from memory while he was lying down relaxing. He would help them solve their problems with such speed and accuracy that he always astonished them. Such brains my father had! That is why my aunt used to say that my father was a lion and my brothers and I were goats.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mantu&#039;s unfortunate smoking experience</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mantu&#039;s unfortunate smoking experience" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In our family, my father used to smoke quite often. He liked real cigarettes plus our Indian hookah. My mother also used to smoke the Indian hookah on those days when my father was away at the bank. Then, when my father used to come home on weekends, she was a saint; she never smoked. She was afraid of my father, so she never smoked on Saturday or Sunday. She did not want him to know that she smoked, but he knew.</p>
<p>When my uncle was alive, so many times he begged my father to give up smoking for the sake of his health. My father did not listen to his repeated requests. But on the day my uncle died, my father said, "What kind of love do I have for him if I cannot give up smoking?" On that day he gave up smoking for good. He never touched cigarettes or Indian hookahs again.</p>
<p>Among my brothers and sisters, nobody was interested in smoking. One of our servants instigated Mantu to smoke. Mantu was outside, sitting on a swing. After inhaling the cigarette smoke for a few seconds, my poor brother's head began rotating. He fell down from the swing and got hurt. His right eye was badly damaged.</p>
<p>When my eldest sister, Arpita, discovered that Mantu had been smoking and that he had fallen down and hurt himself, she commanded him to come inside the house. She took him into one of the rooms and bolted the door from inside. Then she started beating him black and blue. Mantu was crying and crying. In comparison to Mantu's height, she was like a dwarf! He was much stronger than Arpita, but out of respect for his eldest sister he did not fight back. He had to accept her beating. Then he took an oath that he would never smoke again. That was his first and last time smoking.</p>
<p>Luckily, I never wanted to smoke. When I saw my brother's fate at the hands of my sister, I said, "Who wants to be beaten?" This is how I got the smoking lesson in my life.</p>

<p>In our family, when I pinched my brothers or told lies, everyone knew who the real culprit was because my brothers were all saints. Actual fighting was not in our family. Scolding and insulting they did, but physical violence was not permitted. I did wrestling and other things, but the others did not believe in sports. Only Mantu did a little running. But Hriday did not do any sport, and Chitta did only walking. They were bookworms. In our family, I wrote the books and they read the books.</p>
<p>I am totally different in nature from the rest of the family, totally different. You can say that in their nature, they are like Brahmins. I was the only Kshatriya warrior. They were all serious in their spiritual life and I was just the opposite, specially when I was growing up in Chittagong. At that time, seriousness was not born in my life. I was a vagabond. Of course, after I joined the Ashram I immediately gave up my vagabond life. Also, there I never struck my brothers. It was overnight transformation.</p>

<p>My brother Chitta had a special dhoti. When I saw that particular dhoti, I wanted to have it, and I started crying for it. How could my brother tell me that it was for our father when he dies? I was such a fool! I went to my father and told him that my brother had such a nice dhoti and he would not give it to me.</p>
<p>My father got the point. He said to Chitta, "I am not going to die soon. You give it to him!"</p>
<p>When my father uttered the word "die," I felt miserable and tears came into my eyes. After that, I did not take my brother's dhoti.</p>

<p>In the evening of his life, my father taught everything to my brother Chitta. Then, during the last ten or twelve years of my father's life, if there was any problem involving the family, my father would say, "Go to Chitta. He knows better than I do." My father had such confidence in Chitta! When you see that somebody else in your family can do your job well, it is such a relief. You get tremendous joy because you are the one who taught him.</p>

<p>When my father was teaching Chitta how to do everything, my father used to play a trick on my brother. My father used to pretend that he was a fool. He used to say wrong things deliberately so that my brother could catch him.</p>
<p>Then he would play another trick. My brother would ask him a serious question and my father would answer in three or four different ways. He would give two or three wrong answers and one correct answer would be mixed in with them. Then my brother had to find the correct answer.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My father&#039;s unique occult power</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My father&#039;s unique occult power" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father had the unique capacity to remove bones that were caught in people's throats. If someone had been eating meat or fish and if a bone got stuck in his throat, my father knew how to remove it occultly.</p>
<p>Just before my father's death, when I was ten years old, a middle-aged Muslim got a bone stuck in his throat. He went to so many doctors, and they all said he had to undergo a serious operation. He could not eat anything and he was in absolute agony, but he was afraid of having a serious operation. The Muslim found out that my father had the capacity to remove bones from people's throats, so he came to see my father along with two or three of his friends. By that time, the Muslim had become very, very weak because he had not been able to eat for so many days, and he was crying and screaming in agony.</p>
<p>Usually, when Muslims came to our house, they were not allowed to go past the courtyard, which was sixty or seventy metres from the main house. So this Muslim was told to wait in the courtyard. At that time, my father was bed-ridden and he was near death. Everybody was annoyed that at such a time someone had to come and bother him.</p>
<p>Chitta and my uncle thought that because my father was on his deathbed, he had lost the occult powers he once had. So they casually asked him if he still had this particular capacity. My father said, "Yes, I have the capacity. Is there anybody suffering from that problem in the family?"</p>
<p>They said, "It is not anybody in the family, but somebody else — a Muslim." Both Chitta and my uncle were dead against my father using his capacity to help the man. They said, "We do not want a Muslim to come into your room."</p>
<p>My father said, "He can stay in the courtyard and I will cure him from my bed. Just ask him to lie down."</p>
<p>So Chitta went and gave the man the message from my father. My father rubbed his throat three or four times, breathed heavily a few times and coughed. Then my father said, "Go and see!"</p>
<p>When Chitta and my uncle went out into the courtyard again, they found the Muslim crying with joy. The bone in his throat had completely disappeared. He wanted to give my father some money, but my father would not accept it.</p>
<p>That was my father's last act on earth. He did not know the Muslim; this man was not even an acquaintance of my father. But just because he was suffering, my father helped him.</p>
<p>Two or three days later, my father died.</p>

<p>The day my father died, he told my brother Chitta, "Give me anything you want me to eat." For quite a few days he had not eaten, and everybody was very concerned about him. But on the day he left the body, he told them to give him whatever they wanted him to eat.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My uncle saves my brother</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My uncle saves my brother" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One month after my father passed away, we had the obsequies. This is a special day in our Hindu tradition. If you come of a rich family, you are supposed to have a celebration and feed hundreds of people on that day.</p>
<p>My brother Chitta was fully responsible for everything. So many goats were sacrificed and food was prepared to serve all the villagers.</p>
<p>Many people came and asked my brother for money. He would give them money and half an hour later they would come and ask him again, as if they had not received anything. My brother was so upset.</p>
<p>My maternal uncle saw that these people were harassing my brother and so he said, "I am the head of the family today. If people want to ask for money, they should come to me and I will give them. You do not have to worry. I will be responsible. I do not want them to bother you anymore."</p>
<p>So for that entire day, my maternal uncle was in charge of the house. When people saw that my maternal uncle was in charge, nobody came to him for money. They had already taken once or even twice from my brother because he did not have the heart to refuse them. But they knew that they could not fool my maternal uncle.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The extra rice</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The extra rice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>My father passed away in 1942 during the second World War. In the last year of his life, the Japanese began to bombard East Bengal and a huge hole, like a swimming pool, opened up in front of our bank in Chittagong. Many times, when we heard the planes coming, we had to go inside the air raid shelters.</p>
<p>My brother Chitta was concerned that if the war continued, it would be difficult to find enough rice and other food for the entire family. So he sent one of our servants to the town to buy about forty huge bags of rice. He bought enough not only for our family but also to sell to the poor people at a very cheap price. The servant brought them back to our village by boat and others came to help him unload them. I tried to lift one bag, but I could not even budge it.</p>
<p>My brother also bought other kinds of food. He kept everything in a temporary shop, and every night one servant would stand guard in front of it. One night, it was the turn of the servant who bought the rice to be the guard. His name was Phoni. That night, very nicely he stole a few bags of rice!</p>
<p>It seems that he took it to another village. There he sold it to one particular shop. It happened that this shop was very near my aunt's house. Quite innocently, my aunt went to that shop a few days later to buy rice. The shopkeeper told her, "Today I am giving it to you at a very cheap price because somebody from Shakpura has sent his servant with a very large amount of rice to sell to me."</p>
<p>My aunt knew that my brother had bought extra rice and so when my aunt saw him two or three days later, she said: "Why did you give your rice away to be sold? Was it wise? Now you do not have enough in reserve in case of emergency."</p>
<p>This is how that bad fellow was exposed. In order to sell the rice to the unsuspecting shopkeeper, he said that my brother had authorised him to bring it there and he was supposed to take the money back to my brother. But he never returned. We never saw Phoni again. Phoni came from that village where my aunt lived. It was our aunt who brought him to our place. We took him as our servant on her recommendation. So this is how relatives can sometimes do us a favour!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A reluctant confession</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A reluctant confession" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One day, soon after my father passed away, my brother Chitta was sitting reading the Isa Upanishad in front of our temporary shop. I was nearby pumping up a small football. I was planning to go and play with it. All on a sudden, a fellow came up to my brother. He was screaming that my father had borrowed money from him and never repaid him. I got so furious with this man because he was harassing my brother. My brother had so many worries and anxieties at that time. But my brother just remained silent.</p>
<p>Then when he saw that my brother was maintaining his poise, the man abruptly left our shop. A short while later, he came back. My brother was still seated there, reading from the Upanishads. The man fell at my brother's feet and begged his forgiveness. He said, "I am the culprit. It is I who borrowed a large amount of money from your father and I never repaid him. What is more, he never asked me for the money. Please forgive me."</p>
<p>My brother Chitta simply smiled at him and remained silent.</p>
