  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How important is faith?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How important is faith?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The role of faith is of paramount importance in the seeker’s life. Always he has to feel that he is God’s son, and that he has to realise God consciously. Ultimately it is God who protects, liberates and illumines a seeker. If the seeker has no faith, then he cannot proceed. If he does not have faith, that means he has something else: doubt. Either one has faith or one has doubt. There is no middle ground. Doubt puts real poison into us. A seeker must have faith in God and also in himself. If he loses faith in God or in his search for Truth, then his progress may be slow. But if he loses faith in himself, then he is doomed. By doubting God, by doubting our friends and neighbours, and by doubting ourselves we do not gain anything. If we have faith in ourselves and in God, constantly our life-tree is blossoming. He who has faith feels God’s presence inside himself and inside others. Faith is our constant inner growth. If there is no faith, there is no growth. If there is no growth, how are we going to reach the Highest? So faith is of paramount importance in the spiritual life.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do human beings have free will?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do human beings have free will?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As an ordinary human being, we have very limited free will. But if we become a sincere seeker, then we will be surcharged eventually with an adamantine will. Now we are like a cow that is tied to a pole. There is a point beyond which we cannot go, but within these confines we have free will. The higher we go or the deeper we go, the more our capacity increases. When we can listen to the dictates of the soul, or when we can bring the soul forward to illumine our vital, our mind and our gross physical, then our will becomes boundless. At that time, our individual will unites itself with the universal Will within us. When the universal Will becomes our will, at that time our freedom is infinite. Although we have free will to a very limited extent right now, this free will can be increased in infinite measure.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human determination is not and cannot be the last answer. Usually determination comes from the vital or from the mind. It tries to achieve something by hook or by crook. Real will or will-power comes from the soul. There is no difference between the soul’s light and will-power. The soul’s light can illumine everything, and once we see something illumined, there is no obstruction. If the road is illumined, then we can walk and run. But if the road is obscure and dark, at any moment we may stumble and fall.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Suppose your father is sick and you pray to God. If your prayer is soulful, then God will definitely cure your father if that is His Will. But even if your prayer is most soulful, if God wants your father to go through an experience of sickness, He knows what is best for your father as well as for you. Then you have to know that God Himself is suffering in and through your father. It is God Himself who is having that particular experience. But even if God does not cure your father, your soulful prayers will not be lost. God will fulfil your prayers in a different way. Since your prayer has knocked at God’s Door, God will keep the sincerity, the soulful quality of your prayer inside His Heart. Your prayer God preserves as a peerless treasure. Then He will enlarge and expand your heart and illumine your life. He will give you a very big heart. Today you are crying and praying for the cure of your father; tomorrow you will cry for ten persons; the day after for the vast humanity. At that time, you will pray not just for your near and dear ones; you will pray for all of suffering humanity. God will give you the divine capacity to pray for all of humanity.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can we keep the heart’s door open all the time?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can keep your heart’s door wide open all the time if you can value the presence of God. You have to feel that without the conscious presence of God you cannot exist, not even for a fleeting second. If you can feel that you can exist on earth without drinking water or without eating food or without breathing, if you can feel that there is nothing on earth which is essential to your life except to consciously feel God’s presence inside your heart, then you can easily keep your heart’s door wide open. Feel that if you do not consciously feel His presence inside your heart, that is worse than death. You need Him desperately; you need Him at every second of your life. If you don’t have that kind of need or urge, then you cannot keep your heart’s door open. But when you come to realise that nothing is indispensable in your life except God, then your heart’s door will automatically remain open.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How do we get rid of vanity, ego and pride?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How do we get rid of vanity, ego and pride?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways. One way is by invoking Peace, Light and Bliss through prayer and meditation. You can bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above and then illumine vanity, ego and pride. When Peace, Light and Bliss descend, vanity, pride and ego disappear. This is the spiritual approach.</p>
<p>There is also a practical approach which is quite effective on the ordinary human level, Suppose you are a good singer and you are very proud of your voice. Immediately ask yourself whether you are by far the best singer on earth. Your immediate answer will be no, there are many who sing far better than you do. If you have studied and have become a great scholar, you may feel you have every reason to be proud. But if you become sincere and ask yourself whether you are the greatest scholar on earth, your immediate sincere answer will be no. There are some people who far surpass you in knowledge and wisdom. No matter in which walk of life you are eminent, there is always someone who has far surpassed you. How can you be bloated with pride when you know that there is someone who has surpassed you in your field? We are proud of ourselves because we feel that we have achieved something which others have not achieved. But the moment we see that there are others who have far surpassed our capacity, immediately our achievement pales into insignificance and our pride has to die.</p>
<p>The difficulty with this approach is that this realisation may not last. It may last for five days or five months or five years: then we totally forget about others who have surpassed us in our field. Again we enter into ignorance and build up our ego, pride and vanity. Then after a while perhaps sincerity once more dawns. Nobody wants to fool himself all the time. Because we are spiritual people, sincerity wants to come to the fore in us. We see that there are others who have better qualities and capacities than we have, and then we try to compete with them and transcend our present capacity.</p>
<p>At this stage of development, for many people the spiritual process of trying to bring down Peace, Light and Bliss is simply impossible. So let us take the practical point of view and compare ourselves with others. With the spiritual approach of aspiring for Peace, Light and Bliss, there is no competition. If we get Peace, Light and Bliss, immediately we are satisfied. Also, if we have the feeling of oneness, at that time we don’t compete. My right eye does not compete with my left eye. My right arm, if it has a little more strength than the left arm, does not compete with the left arm. The right arm does not have a superior feeling, because it has accepted the left arm as its very own. When the right arm throws the shot-put, the left arm does not feel miserable. On the contrary, it feels that this is their mutual achievement and it shares the achievement with the right arm. The right arm also gladly shares the achievement, because the left arm and right arm feel their oneness. When we have brought down Peace, Light and Bliss we establish our feeling of oneness with everything and everyone. If another person has achieved something and we have not achieved that thing, on the strength of our inner oneness we feel that it is also our achievement. In oneness there is no competition, no competition whatsoever.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: There are several paths to spiritual attainment and each stresses something different, such as Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga. How can a person know which path is his path, which aspect of the spiritual life he should stress?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: There are several paths to spiritual attainment and each stresses something different, such as Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga. How can a person know which path is his path, which aspect of the spiritual life he should stress?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can easily know. An individual knows whether he likes love and devotion in his life more than knowledge or wisdom. He himself knows whether he is more inclined to work and serve or he is more inclined to pray and meditate. Each individual knows what he wants to do. When morning dawns, immediately he may start working because he feels that work gives him joy; or he may start praying with love and devotion because he feels that this gives him joy. When an individual enters into the spiritual life, he is bound to feel whether he is most inclined toward Bhakti Yoga or Karma Yoga or Jnana Yoga — whether he is most inclined toward love, service or knowledge.</p>
<p>If there is a Master who advocates the path of love, devotion and surrender, one aspirant will go to him. If there is a Master who wants dedicated service, devoted service, surrendered service, someone else will go there. If somebody teaches knowledge and wisdom, then somebody else will go to him. Some will teach the path of the heart, some will teach the path of the mind and some will teach the path of action. It is the seeker who will know which path is meant for him. Then he has to stick to his path. In the university if you like history, you go to the history professor. You don’t go to the geography professor if you don’t like geography. The subject you like, you study; the subject that you do not like, you do not study.</p>
<p>You are bound to know which path is for you because there is always an inner urge for you to achieve something, embody something, reveal something and manifest something. If you want to manifest something, naturally you first have to have it inside you. And why do you have to have that particular thing? Just because there is someone who is pushing you and inspiring you to achieve it. That someone is God within you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes! If somebody is not a seeker and he wants to know about God, then he will only argue unnecessarily. If I am a layman, it is only stupidity if I challenge a doctor or a scientist. If I want to understand some medical ideas, then I have to be at least a nurse; I have to know the ABC’s of medicine. Then when the doctor says something, perhaps I will understand it.</p>
<p>If I don’t feel any need for God, if I don’t want Him, then what can I expect to learn from the person who has Peace, Light and Bliss? In the spiritual life we are all seekers; we have an inner hunger. If we are hungry, then God is there to feed us. But if we are not hungry, then even if I go into a restaurant I will not eat anything. If I am not hungry, it is not your duty to feed me. A spiritual Master is like that. If somebody is hungry, he feeds him; if somebody is not hungry, then the Master does not feed him.</p>

<h2>Question: Is there any difference between one God-realised Master and another?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is a difference between one God-realised Master and another. Once someone touches the foot of the realisation-tree, you can call him a God-realised Master. But while one Master has only touched the foot of the tree, another has climbed up to the topmost bough and then come down again for manifestation. Some Masters have only a little boat that will carry two or three aspirants across the sea of ignorance. But great Masters, avatars, can carry the whole of humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not a psychological state; it is an inner experience that enters into our consciousness. In the inner world, on the ladder of consciousness there are many rungs. One particular rung is the realisation-rung. A higher rung is the revelation-rung. Another, still higher, is the manifestation-rung. But these are not psychological states. Psychology does not apply to the spiritual life, All spiritual experiences take place in the realm of the universal Heart.</p>

The universal Heart came into existence before God’s sound-life came into existence. And where is the universal Heart? It is deep inside us, where reality constantly grows.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First we have to know whether intellectual activities have given us what we want. If we feel that intellectual activities have not given us abiding satisfaction, then we value the heart more than the mind. Unfortunately, we feel that the reason we are not discovering the truth through the intellect is because we are not properly illumined or not properly dealing with the intellect. We don’t realise that there is no chance of finding the ultimate Truth or Reality in the intellect. Right now we have the feeling that the intellect can give us as adequate an answer as the heart. But a day will come when we will feel that it is only the heart that can give us the real answer. Once the heart brings us that answer, we shall then bring it into the intellect. The physical mind and the intellect will not always remain unillumined. Everything has to be illumined eventually. But we have to get illumination from where it is available, and then bring it where it is not yet available.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two ways to meditate. One way is to silence the mind. An ordinary man feels that if he silences the mind he becomes a tool. He feels that if the mind does not think, the mind has lost everything. But this is not true in the spiritual life. In the spiritual life when we silence the mind we see that a new creation, a new promise to God, dawns in the mind. Right now we have not fulfilled our promise to God; we have not totally dedicated our existence to God. When we can silence the mind, we are in a position to please and fulfil God.</p>
<p>Right now we do not hear God’s Voice. There may be something we hear from within that we feel is God’s Voice, but it may be only a voice coming from our subtle physical or subtle vital or from somewhere else. But when we silence the mind, we can hear a silent voice inside the very depth of our heart or above our head, and that is the Voice of God. Once we hear the Voice of God we cannot make any mistake in our life. If we listen to its dictates all the time, we will go forward, upward and inward constantly.</p>
<p>Another way to meditate is to empty the heart. Right now the heart is full of emotional turmoil and problems caused by the impure vital which has enveloped it. The heart is a vessel. Right now this vessel is full of undivine things, things that limit and bind us. If we can empty the heart vessel, there is someone who will fill it with divine Peace, Light and Bliss, which will liberate us. When we empty our heart of ignorance, God’s Wisdom-Light will come and fill it.</p>
<p>A seeker can make a choice, or he can do both forms of meditation. In the morning he can try to silence his mind and in the evening he can try to empty his heart. Our meditation is our inner food. We have to eat if we want to be inwardly strong. If the food is nourishing and delicious, then we can eat the same food in the morning and in the evening. But if we enjoy two types of food and feel that both types have the same sweet taste and the same nourishment, then we can eat both. But if we find that one form of meditation is more difficult than the other, we should do the one that is easier. If both are equally easy, then we are very fortunate; we can have a variety of food.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we pray and meditate, we give and receive; we offer and achieve. Right now we feel that ignorance is our possession. Although we say that ignorance is very bad, we don’t want to give it away. But we have to know that ignorance is not our real possession; our real possessions are Peace, Light and Bliss. During our prayer and meditation we should offer to God our false possessions and receive from God our real possessions. We should ask God to take what we have and what we are and to give us what He has and what He is. What we have is aspiration, the inner cry to become divine. What we are is ignorance. We ask God to take both our aspiration and our ignorance and to give us what He has and what He is: Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. When we breathe in, we can feel that we are breathing in God’s immortal qualities, and when we breathe out, we can feel that we are offering God our ignorance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does one go about silencing the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does one go about silencing the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Just as a child cries for a toy, we have to cry to God to silence our mind. If we follow a spiritual path under the guidance of a true spiritual Master, the Master can help the disciple to silence his mind if he sees that the disciple is sincere in his aspiration. Our aspiration is our most powerful inner weapon. We have to become a divine warrior who is always ready to fight against ignorance, a divine warrior who wants to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, beginning with his own nature. As a divine warrior, we will guard the mind’s door with a naked sword. When an undivine thought comes, we will immediately kill it.</p>
<p>Another way is to adopt a totally indifferent attitude toward our thoughts. Right now we have made friends with ignorance, with undivine thoughts. It is very difficult for us to tell them not to visit us any more. These thoughts feel that they have found a safe harbour in us, since we have always made them welcome. When they see that their lifelong friend is neglecting them and not giving them proper attention, first they wonder what is wrong with us. They see that they have done nothing wrong, and they decide that it is our own stupidity that is making us ignore them. After a while they feel that it is beneath their dignity to visit us. Just as we have pride and vanity, ignorance also has pride and vanity. So these thoughts that were once our closest friends refuse to enter into us because we are not paying any attention to them.</p>
<p>Undivine thoughts are like monkeys. The nature of the monkey is to bite us. If we just ignore it, the monkey will bite us a few times and, if there is no reaction, it will go away. But if the monkey bites us, if we strike it vehemently a few times, the monkey also goes away. Both methods are effective. Either we have to have the strength not to pay attention to the bite of the monkey or we have to strike it.</p>
