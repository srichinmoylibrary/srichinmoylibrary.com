<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly he can. Even if he does not consciously spread it, his very presence will spread it. It is like this. The very nature of a flower is to spread fragrance. The flower may not talk to you or tell you, "Look, I have purity! I am now giving it to you; so take it, take it!" No. But the very fact that you are near a flower will immediately bring you purity. If you have something, if you have a dollar, you can give it to me. Again, if you don't give it to me, then I don't get it. It is up to you. But when it is a matter of purity, even if you don't want to give it, already it is spreading, because purity is something divine. Anything that is undivine will bind you and try to bind others. But anything that is divine you cannot bind; you cannot hold it back. It is free, absolutely free; it is immortal, eternal. When you have purity, automatically it will flow. If you stand in front of a saint, your whole being becomes purified. His very presence makes you pure. A spiritual Master, by his very presence, spreads Peace, Light and Bliss. When he comes in front of you, he spreads it. He can't hold it. Always it is going out.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we purify our daily actions?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we purify our daily actions?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, that is what we are aiming at. If we cannot purify our daily actions, then how are we going to make progress? Again, if we make progress, then only can we purify our life. These things go together. If I become good, only then will I become a good instrument of God. And if I become a chosen instrument of God, then only will I become really divine. They go together. It is like meditation in action. If I meditate well, then only can I think of loving God and serving God. Again, if I serve God devotedly and unconditionally, then only can I think of meditating at my highest. As action and meditation go together, so purity in our day-to-day life and spiritual progress must go together; they are complementary. If we don't have purity, we cannot make very fast progress. And any progress that we do make does not remain permanently if we do not have purity. So, purity is of paramount importance in the spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two months ago you accepted our spiritual path. So feel that you are two months old. The day that you accepted the spiritual life was the real birth for you, and not twenty-four or twenty-five years ago when you came into the world. The moment you accept the spiritual life becomes your spiritual birth, a new birth for you, a new incarnation. So if you are only two months old, how can impurity enter into you? It is impossible. Always think how many years you have been with us and how many years you will be with us. Today you are two months old. Now you have to feel that you are an eternal child of God; but consciously you have to feel that you are an eternal child of God. As a child you will always remain pure. So if you say, "I will remain an eternal child of the Supreme," then naturally you will maintain all purity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your mind has pride because you feel you have achieved something that others have not achieved. Suppose you think that you are more beautiful than your sister and your mind is giving you pride. Immediately be sincere to yourself. You will say, "True, I may be more beautiful than my sister, but there are thousands of other people on earth who are more beautiful than I." So your mind will get a slap. Or suppose your mind tells you, "I have much more knowledge than my sister; my sister is an idiot and I know so much." At that time just think of how many people there are on earth who have more wisdom than you. Just think of some of the professors at Yale or Harvard and make a comparison. Immediately your sincerity will make you feel that those professors are like intellectual giants. You can be proud only when you keep everyone under your feet. You can be proud just because you know a little more than your sister or you are a little more beautiful than your sister. But you must compare yourself with someone who is infinitely superior to you. Then pride will go. Pride will see that it is nowhere. Since it is comparison that is creating pride in you, you have to make comparisons with somebody that will make you humble. So when comparison makes you proud, haughty, at that time, make a comparison with somebody else who will immediately make you humble.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can the ego ever have purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can the ego ever have purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Human ego can never have purity. Human ego wants only to bind: "I, my, mine — <em>my</em> brother, <em>my</em> father, <em>my</em> friend." I am limited as an individual and I think of my mother and my father as limited. So when I am limited, and the world that I am claiming as my own is limited, how can there be purity? Purity is something vast, infinite, whereas ego makes us think that we are meant only for one or two or three. First ego says that we are meant only for ourselves; there is no world around us. We are our only world. Then ego says, "My mother, my father, my brother." This is our only world. But this is all impurity. When we are binding someone or bound by someone, it is all ignorance. It is ignorance that makes us feel that only our immediate family is ours and that the rest of the world has nothing to do with us and we have nothing to do with them. Ignorance and impurity go together, whereas wisdom and purity go together. So this ego can never be pure.</p>
<p>But there is also another type of ego. We call it ego, but it is not actually ego. It is our identification, our feeling of oneness, with God. "I am God's chosen daughter, so how can I do this? How can I tell a lie! How can I deceive someone! How can I waste my time! It is beneath my dignity. God-realisation is my birthright." That kind of feeling is called total identification with God, but the mind may tell us that it is a form of ego. If we had to make a choice between calling ourselves God's son and Satan's son, would we not say that we are God's son? Here also we have to make a choice between our little ego that says we belong to mother, father, brother, sister, and the big ego that says we belong to the Infinite, the Eternal, the Immortal. So that type of ego, which is actually our sense of identification with the Absolute, is most welcome. When we talk about ego, it is the little one, the little 'I'. But when we think of God, immediately 'I' goes away and becomes 'we'. I represent 'I', you represent 'I', he represents 'I', everybody represents himself or herself. But God does not represent Himself, because God has created everyone; so God has to become 'we'.</p>
<p>We always have to feel that the human ego is all impure. But the divine feeling of oneness — 'I am God's child, God-realisation is my birthright, God-manifestation is my birthright' — is divine ego, and that is extremely good.</p>

Are there any meditations or practices I can use?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The small 'I' will always make you feel that you are most important — not the Centre, not the Mission, not your spiritual brothers and sisters, but you. If something is to be done, the little 'I' says, "I will do it and take all the credit." But the big 'I' will say, "No, let us do it together." The little ego is thinking only of your own progress; it cares only for your realisation, for your illumination. But the big 'I' will say, "If it is God's Will, I will remain absolutely useless. But I want God to be fully manifested on earth." If God-manifestation comes first, that is the big 'I', the big heart. "I will remain obscure, but God should be fully manifested. Our Mission should be fully manifested. Our Centres should be well-known so that we spread Light. Our brothers and sisters should be together so that we can have a very strong family." These are all big 'I's. The little 'I' will say, "Let me remain in a Himalayan cave and realise God. Why should I be bothered?" That is the little 'I'. When you care only for your own self-perfection, your own liberation, and you ignore the rest of the world, then you are gone. You have to take the entire body as a whole. If you pay attention only to your eye or nose, then you are lost. If you make your nose totally perfect while your arms and ears are imperfect, then what will people think? Do you think people will appreciate you? No, they will see your arms are defective, your forehead is defective, everything is defective; only your nose is perfect. But if it is the big 'I' that is operating, then you will care for full perfection: "We shall be perfect together. Eye, ear, nose, leg, knee — everything will be perfect." The big 'I' will tell you, "Go together," and the small 'I' will tell you, "Go alone." So during your prayer, always first think of the Supreme, then think of the Mission, then think of the Centre, then think of the disciples, then think of yourself. If you do that, immediately you will be able to separate your little 'I' from the big 'I'.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can you embody purity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can you embody purity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can embody purity through your constant aspiration for purity. You achieve something when you feel the need for it. Just say, "I need purity, I need purity, I need purity!" Your eternal Father Supreme will give you purity. When the child cries for something, the mother gives. But sometimes she waits to see if the child really wants it, or whether he will stop crying and no longer care for the thing. Sometimes when a child cries for something, before the mother gives it the child goes away and plays somewhere else. You cry for two minutes, "Purity, purity," and God is bringing down purity. But when you don't feel purity in your whole being, immediately you become impatient. You think that God will not bring you purity so you change your mind and you do something else. But if you really want and need something, you will keep on crying for it. If a child really needs something, he continuously cries unless and until he has got the thing he needs. In the spiritual life also, if you cry for purity until you have achieved purity, God is bound to bring purity into your life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For the disciple, the Master is the highest purity, and the highest purity is the Master. During the day when you breathe in and out, you have to feel my presence in your heart. When you breathe in you have to feel that you are breathing in the highest purity from me, and when you breathe out you have to feel that I am bringing out all the impurities you have inside your system and throwing them into the Universal Consciousness.</p>
<p>If you can constantly feel in your mind, in your heart, in your soul, in every incident in your day-to-day outer life that I am the highest, then you get the best purity. It cannot be a vague idea, but a constant living feeling that I am the highest. Otherwise, at this moment you will feel that I am very high, even the highest, but the next moment, when your desires are not fulfilled, you will feel that I am not only low, but the lowest. If I do not fulfil your inner desires, you will feel, "Either he turned a deaf ear or he has no ear, he has no capacity." This kind of tribute I get from the disciples.</p>
<p>If I don't fulfil your desires, if you can feel it is for your own good, absolutely for your good, and if you can consider me always the highest in spite of so-called defeat, failure and frustration, then the problem of impurity is solved. In everything if you can feel that I am the highest and the best, then you are bound to get the best and the highest from me. Then, if you have everything that is best, you will see that purity will come first and foremost. Everything that your soul needs, everything that your life of aspiration, your life of realisation, your life of manifestation needs, is bound to come if you are placing me first and foremost in your life. This is what a real disciple does.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You cannot ask a collective question because you may have achieved one state of consciousness and somebody else may be one inch higher or one inch lower. Somebody may be ten miles ahead of you and someone may be ten miles behind. So I cannot make a general statement, because everyone has established purity according to his spiritual development.</p>
<p>If you want to know how far you yourself are from purity, then you have to ask the question, "How intimately do I feel God in my day-to-day life, in every moment of my life?" If you feel the living Presence of God every moment of your life, that means you are extremely pure. The moment you feel consciously the Presence of God, at that time you are one hundred per cent pure. If inside your heart you feel God's living Presence, and not just a vague idea that God exists, at that time your whole body is pure. Again, when you don't feel God's Presence, no matter how many times you wash your hands or how many flowers you keep in front of your nose, you will not have purity. You are a perfect stranger to purity at that time.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we purify the kind of love and devotion that we are trying to offer to you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we purify the kind of love and devotion that we are trying to offer to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The easiest way to do this is to say to yourself early in the morning, "Guru thinks of me infinitely more than I think of myself. Guru loves me infinitely more than I love myself." Say it only once, most soulfully. In the beginning you will do this like a parrot, since I am requesting you to do it. But the day will come when you will see that there is no parrot there; you will see with your soul that this is absolutely true.</p>
<p>When you say that I think of you more than you think of yourself, you have to know that 'thinking' is not the proper word. 'Thinking' here is the soul's feeling of oneness. In the outer life, in the ordinary life, we say, "I am thinking of you." But it is only to convince the mind that we even mention the thinking process. In the soul's world it is not thinking; it is all identification, or let us use the term 'oneness'. Your mind may tell you, "Right now Guru is talking to my brother; he is doing this and that, so how can he say he is thinking of me?" But if you know the real meaning of the word 'oneness', then you will be able to convince your mind that I really think of you much more than you think of yourself. Otherwise, your mind will say, "He is always thinking of his success, his progress, his deeds. He does not use my name even once a day." But you have to feel that my oneness with you is infinitely more secure and well-established than your oneness with me. You have to feel that I have done my part and I will all the time do my part. Now it is up to you to do your share. If you can feel that way, then anything you have to offer me will be divine.</p>
<p>Then again, you have to feel that the thing which you want to give me I have already given to you. If you feel that I gave you divine love and devotion first, that it is not your own and that you are just returning it to me, it is easy. But if you feel that you are giving me, whereas I am not giving you anything, then there will be some difficulty. Again, if you feel that you are giving me love and devotion for the first time, then naturally you will give me earth-bound love and devotion. But if you feel that you are giving me something that I have already given to you, then it comes to me as something divine, because what I gave you was divine.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is there a way to get purity through action?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is there a way to get purity through action?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. You can get purity through action, but you have to know what kind of action it is. The action that demands constant satisfactory results will not be able to give you purity. You do something; you throw the shot. You have practised very hard and now you will wait for the result. You say, "I want to place first." Your mind will say that you deserve it. From the mind's point of view, you deserve it. From the vital's point of view, you deserve it. From the physical's point of view, you deserve it. But from the soul's point of view, perhaps you don't deserve it, because the soul will say, "It is not what you do, but how you do it." Did you do it devotedly, did you do it soulfully? If there is a competitive spirit inside, if there is any jealousy inside, if there is a kind of pride or vanity inside, the soul will observe.</p>
<p>Then God will come and see; He will be the judge. He will see whether you are doing it with the idea or the feeling that you are just the instrument. If you have the feeling that you are the shot and God is the thrower, then automatically you become the instrument. If you are just the instrument, you are bound to get one hundred per cent in purity. You are doing nothing; God just picked you up from the ground and He is doing the throwing. So how can you not be pure, since God is all Purity? If you do it with the idea that you have become one with the soul, if it is immaterial to you whether you stand first or last, if the result you will offer to God, then you may get 75 out of 100. If you are throwing it most devotedly, without any jealousy, without any feeling of competition, but only with selfless detachment, you are bound to get 70 or 75 out of 100. Again, if you do it with an aggressive feeling, just to feed your pride and vanity, at that time you will get probably zero or five or ten. Five you may get because you have worked very hard, but when it is time for the real judgement, you may get zero. But if you do it devotedly and soulfully, 75 you will get. And if you can feel that you are not the doer, but that you are the shot itself and God has thrown you, if you can feel you are not responsible at all, then you will get 100 out of 100.</p>
<p>Again, when you do something, you have to use your heart and soul. Otherwise you will strike your younger sister and say, "No, it was not I. It was God who slapped my sister." God is not there. But if you become absolutely one with your younger sister with your love, affection, concern and compassion, then if she has done something really wrong and your love-power does not work, then perhaps your threatening-power is needed. If you feel this from the very depth of your heart at the time you give her a slap, then you will feel that it is not you who have given her a slap, but God who has done it. You are just an instrument; God has utilised you. If you feel this, then you are getting again 100 out of 100.</p>
<p>But just because you are older than your sister, if you feel, "She is an idiot. I know so much about spiritual life and about earthly life, so I have every right to slap her," you are wrong. You will do the action, but who is inspiring you, who is guiding you? It is your undivine vital that is instigating you. If your vital makes you feel that by striking her you are bringing her to some understanding or divine wisdom, then you are getting zero, absolutely zero.</p>
<p>So when you do something, you have to know whether you are being instigated by your vital or inspired by your soul, or illumined by the Supreme. If the Supreme is illumining you, if the Supreme is using you as an instrument to perfect your sister, then you are purity itself; your action is all purity. And if your soul, which sees the light, is inspiring you to do the right thing, then there is 50 per cent purity. But if you are being instigated, then there is 99 per cent impurity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we purify our feeling of gratitude towards God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we purify our feeling of gratitude towards God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know if it is real gratitude. Gratitude itself is pure. If it is real gratitude, it is all purity; but if it is false gratitude, then it is impurity. How do you know if it is false gratitude or genuine gratitude? It is very easy. If God has given you a dollar, and you offer your gratitude to God with the idea that He will be so pleased that He will give you ten dollars, then your gratitude is impure. You will offer your gratitude, but inside your gratitude hope will loom large. You are offering gratitude, but you are consciously or unconsciously cherishing the hope that He will give you much more.</p>
<p>But divine gratitude is different. When you offer divine gratitude, you are offering it because God has done something for you. You know that there are millions of people on earth to whom God has not given a dollar, but to you He has given it, even though you don't deserve it or you feel that you don't deserve it. God is doing everything unconditionally. If you feel that He is doing everything unconditionally, then automatically you feel pure gratitude. If you feel that what you have is coming unconditionally from God whether or not you deserve it, then your gratitude is bound to become pure.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — Compassion</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — Compassion" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What does God's Compassion do when we resist God's Grace?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Compassion and Grace are the same thing, but Compassion is much more intense. The same Grace, when it has tremendous intensity, is called Compassion. Water is everywhere, but when there is a torrential rain, you can say Compassion is descending. It is like a heavy downpour from above, with tremendous force. Grace is also water, but water is here, there, everywhere. This is the difference between Compassion and Grace.</p>
<p>When an individual resists God's Compassion, God either waits indefinitely and uses His Patience-Power, or He uses more Compassion. In His case He deals with infinite Compassion. He does not accept any defeat. If we resist His Compassion, He may use more of His Compassion-Power to conquer us, or He may allow us to stay for ten, twenty, fifty, sixty or a hundred years more in ignorance. He is dealing with eternal Time. It is up to Him whether to force us to accept His Light in a different way. But this forcing does not occur in a human way. His forcing means that He will use more of the Compassion-Power which He has and which He is. From His infinite Compassion-Power He will use more Compassion-Power in order to conquer our ignorance. But if He meets with tremendous resistance, then He may change His mind. He may say "No, he wants to sleep; let him sleep for another hundred years. There is no hurry in it." But God will never withdraw His Compassion for good, no matter how we resist His Compassion. Only we delay our progress, our onward, upward, inward progress, by resisting God's Compassion-Power. For God's Compassion-Power is His magnet-power, His magnetic power that draws us to His very Heart, which is all Light and Delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we show the Supreme gratitude for His Compassion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we show the Supreme gratitude for His Compassion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We do not actually show gratitude; we <em>become</em> gratitude. Gratitude is not a matter of showing. Here I have a finger and I can show it. No, it is not like that. The moment we want to show gratitude, we take away the sweetness, the real wealth, the real secret or real power, the very <em>raison d’être</em> of gratitude. So gratitude we don't show; we don't even express it. Gratitude is something that we grow into, we become. It is not a matter of offering gratitude when God shows us infinite Compassion. We have to just become gratitude itself.</p>
<p>Suppose I do something for you. Let us say I give you a smile or I help you in your meditation. Immediately become a garland of gratitude, but not with the idea of expressing it. The moment you express, the reality goes away from its Divinity's height. During your meditation, if you feel that the Supreme, our eternal Guru, has given you a good meditation, then without using the human tongue, you can say, "O Supreme, I am so grateful to You. You have granted me today a very high meditation. It is all due to Your Compassion." Instead of uttering this, instead of using the human tongue, just feel inside that your heart is all gratitude. If your heart is all gratitude it means your real existence has become all gratitude.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you show someone compassion, can this other person see light or anything in your compassion?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you show someone compassion, can this other person see light or anything in your compassion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you show sincere compassion to someone, then you are bound to receive Light from God. As a matter of fact, the moment you show compassion to someone, you have to feel that it is God's Light in the form of compassion which is flowing through you. When you show compassion it means that Light has already descended into your inner being, into your system, and you are just a perfect channel. The Light is flowing in and through you to the person who is in need. So you have to know that you have already received Light; otherwise, you would not have cared to show compassion to anybody.</p>
