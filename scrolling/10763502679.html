<p><em>(Ramakrishna with his disciples. Enter Captain.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Come in, Captain. <em>(Captain bows to Ramakrishna.)</em> I know you have read the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> many, many times. I wish to hear from you about the <em>Gopis.</em></p>
<p>CAPTAIN: When Krishna was at Vrindavana he had no wealth, but the <em>Gopis</em> loved him more dearly than they loved their own lives. Their love for Sri Krishna was so pure, so genuine, so divine. They gave him their vital desires and their psychic aspiration. They gave him their all.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Krishna, Krishna . . . <em>(Enters into trance.)</em> Captain, tell me more.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: Not to speak of ordinary yogis, even the great yogis cannot have free access to Krishna’s heart. But because of their devoted love and unconditional surrender to him, the <em>Gopis</em> always had free access to Krishna’s heart.</p>
<p>A DEVOTEE: Thakur, our greatest novelist, Bankim Chandra, recently wrote an excellent book on Krishna.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: I see. Do you know that Bankim does not believe in Radha? He believes only in Krishna.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: That means he does not believe in Krishna’s divine <em>lila.</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: But Bankim also says that sex life is necessary.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: It is very strange that on the one hand he thinks and feels that sex life is necessary, while on the other hand he does not believe in the divine <em>lila</em>, the divine game. I see in him nothing but contradictions.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: You call it contradiction and I call it lack of realisation. Mere book learning and God-realisation are never, never the same thing. For God-realisation you have to pray, you have to meditate. You have to cry like a child. A child cries for his mother and he gets her. If you cry for the Divine Mother’s Nectar, you will get it without fail. Drink, drink my Mother Kali’s Nectar as much as you want to. Be immortal, my sweet children.</p>

<p><em>(Sri Ramakrishna with some of his selected disciples.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: My health is failing very rapidly.</p>
<p>RAKHAL: Please tell us how we can restore your health.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: That depends on the Will of God.</p>
<p>NAREN: I know your will has become inseparably one with God’s Will.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: In this body two persons live: God in the form of an Avatar, and God in the form of a devotee. An Avatar’s devotees come with him and go away with him.</p>
<p>RAKHAL: So you must not go away alone, leaving us behind.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: The religious mendicants appear quite unexpectedly out of the blue. They sing and dance, and again they disappear quite unexpectedly. Hardly anyone recognizes their aspiration. Similarly, spiritual Masters appear and disappear without being recognized. <em>(Ramakrishna closes his eyes for a minute.)</em> I tell you all that a life without renunciation is no life at all. Renounce your ignorance. Renounce your knowledge. Renounce what you have and what you are.</p>
<p>NAREN: When I talk of renunciation some people get terribly annoyed with me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Naren, don’t be afraid of them. Say what you must say. It is through renunciation that you can and you will realise God. <em>(Caresses Naren.)</em> Much.</p>
<p>NAREN <em>(with a smile)</em>: What do you mean by “much"?</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Much renunciation has been accomplished by you. Naren, I have told you many times that you have come into the world for me.</p>
<p>NAREN: I don’t quite understand what you say. Please explain it to me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: You are here on earth to manifest me. I have already given you all that I have. I have nothing left.</p>
<p>NAREN: Do you mean that I have to believe all that you say to me?</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: You will not only believe me but make all of humanity believe who I am.</p>
<p>NAREN: You talk. I listen.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: True. But in the near future you are going to act.</p>
<p>NAREN: From the very dust of your feet you can give birth to millions of Narens like me.</p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Stop, stop. From the very Heart of God, from the very Breath of God you have come. Naren, my Naren, with you I am complete.</p>
<p>NAREN: Thakur, in your heart I am fulfilled. At your feet I am perfect. <em>(Prostrates himself at Ramakrishna’s feet.)</em></p>

<p><em>(The day of Sri Ramakrishna’s passing. His disciples and consort, Sarada Devi, are standing by his bedside. Three disciples are standing a little apart from the others.)</em></p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: It pains me to see our Master like this. His frail frame seems less dependable than a storm-tossed raft.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: By going deep within, still one can discover his true divine personality. Even now one can never doubt his greatness. In his teachings abides a colossal Will that can shake the world.</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: No Indian youth of the rising generation can dream of escaping the subtle influence of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: Ramakrishna will appear to one person as a man of overflowing emotion, to a second as an ardent aspirant, to a third as a man of philosophical wisdom, to a fourth as a man of unique sincerity.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: It is inevitable that different persons should hold different opinions regarding his personality. For in a matter like this, a flawless intellectual analysis is impossible, and all our human judgement will sadly fail to yield any useful answer.</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: But nobody will ever hesitate to call him the most beloved child of the Divine Mother Kali. His sole aim in life was to have nothing save and except a constant union with Mother Kali. This aim he fulfilled. In one word we can sum up the message of his life: Mother.</p>
<p>FIRST DISCIPLE: It is Ramakrishna, too, who has shown the greatest reverence for women that the world has ever known. He feels that women are the embodiment of the Divine Mother and he treats them as divinities. His own consort, Sarada Devi, he worships as the Divine Mother Herself.</p>
<p>SECOND DISCIPLE: The higher consciousness that constantly floods the mind and heart of Sri Ramakrishna exerts a unique influence not only on us, his disciples, but also on all persons around him. It lifts everyone above the ordinary plane to partake of the divine sweetness of Heaven. His very life is in itself the most effective refutation of the half-believer and the unbeliever in the Divine.</p>
<p>THIRD DISCIPLE: Here is a man whose authoritative voice declared that he had not only seen the Omnipotent, but could show Him to his beloved disciple, Naren.</p>
<p><em>(Hearing Naren’s name mentioned, Ramakrishna opens his eyes.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA <em>(pathetically)</em>: Naren ... Naren, why are you silent? You look confused, almost baffled. I have read your mind. Still you doubt me, Naren?</p>
<p><em>(Naren comes closer to his Master, but remains silent.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: He who is Rama, He who is Krishna, in one form is Ramakrishna.</p>
<p><em>(Shedding tears, Naren bows to Sri Ramakrishna and touches his feet.)</em></p>
<p>NAREN: I shall not doubt you any more, Thakur. In your presence, I have found that man can be perfect even in this body. The descent of Avatars like you, O Master, is for the purpose of uplifting and furthering the progress of mankind in the evolutionary process. You go on doing good for mankind in your earthly body as long as it serves the interest of humanity. You are free from the results of your actions, good or bad, big or small.</p>
<p>SARADA DEVI: Now that my Kali — Ramakrishna — is about to pass behind the curtain of Eternity, an excruciating pain is torturing my heart.</p>
<p><em>(She begins to cry bitterly.)</em></p>
<p><em>(To everyone’s surprise, Ramakrishna raises himself slightly.)</em></p>
<p>RAMAKRISHNA: Why do you weep so bitterly? I leave your Naren with you.</p>
<p>SARADA DEVI: Yes, my Divine Lord, it is true. You are the seed sown in the world-soil, and our Naren is the bumper crop which humanity shall reap. Thakur is the Inspiration, his Naren is its Expression. So humanity will have both Inspiration and Expression as its peerless possessions. <em>(She bows down to Ramakrishna.)</em> Glory to you, O Thakur. In you we find a triumphant living example of the truths that you preach. To you we offer our deepest homage. Our hearts feel that what you possess is the Infinite, and that the Infinite is your heart’s Eternal Home.</p>

<p><em>(Madras. Vivekananda is in his room.)</em></p>
<p>VIVEKANANDA <em>(to himself)</em>: Not to satisfy my mental curiosity have I decided to sail for America. No, not to make a noise in the world. My Master’s silent blessing has kindled the inspiration-fire in me to share his light with the soil and soul of America. No country is superior in all spheres of life. As regards spirituality, the Americans are far inferior to us, but their society is far superior to ours. The East has become lost by moving away from materialism; the West, by keeping clear of spirituality. I deeply feel that a happy marriage of the two is the supreme need of the world. Life without spirituality is as poor as life without material power. Hence the East must be surcharged with the dynamism of the West, and the West must be inspired with the ancient wisdom of the East. We will teach them our spirituality and assimilate what is best in their society. Sri Ramakrishna has synthesised most of the major world religions by his direct and immediate realisation of the Truth in each of them. He has pierced the core of each religion, extracted its essence and become the perfect embodiment of that particular path to the Supreme. His precepts are couched in the simplest language, in words that fly straight into the hearts of the people. The blessings that not only India but the entire world has received and will receive from him, from his unique universal sympathy, stand matchless. I look upon the world as my dear Motherland, and upon mankind as my true brothers and sisters. Come what may, to serve them with my Master’s soul-stirring message is my cherished religion.</p>
<p>But now, on the eve of my departure for America, I have decided that I will cross the seas only after receiving some concrete indication from my Master. I am sure my Thakur would sanction my going to America were he still alive. But let me wait for a sign from him.</p>

<p>VIVEKANANDA: For the past week I have waited and waited for some concrete sign from my Master, but all in vain. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Since my spiritual Mother and my Master are one and the same, I shall seek her permission to go abroad. I shall write a letter to Sri Sarada Devi from here in Madras.</p>

<p><em>(A few weeks later.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Naren sings:)</em></p>

<p><em>Ore mor kheya ore mor neye</em><br /><em>Ore ananda bani</em><br /><em>Niye jao mor trishita kshudhita</em><br /><em>Supta chitta khani</em></p>
<p>[O my boat, O my Boatman, <br /> O Message of Transcendental Delight,<br /> Carry me. My heart is thirsty and hungry,<br /> And it is fast asleep at the same time.<br /> Carry my heart to the other shore.]</p>

<p>VIVEKANANDA: Still I have not received a reply from my divine Mother. But just last night I had a most significant dream in which I saw Sri Ramakrishna proceeding to the West over the waves and waters. This I have taken as approval of my plan.</p>
<p><em>(Enter a peon. He hands Vivekananda a letter.)</em></p>
<p>VIVEKANANDA: Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(Exit the peon)</em></p>
<p>VIVEKANANDA: Ah! From my divine Mother! <em>(Reads the letter.)</em> I have received wholehearted permission from my spiritual Mother. Now with redoubled faith I am able to undertake the voyage to America. A spiritual force of Sri Ramakrishna’s power will forever retain its dynamism. It will spread beyond the narrow limits of one little province, of one country, of one continent. The renown of my Master’s spiritual teachings shall travel far and wide, touching the heart of the world and awakening its slumbering soul.</p>
