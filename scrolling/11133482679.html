<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, love is not the purest form of gratitude. Devoted surrender and unconditional oneness are the purest forms of gratitude. Love is very complicated: there is human love, divine love, animal love. Again, even divine love sometimes is mixed up with vital demands. But when there is a constant, inseparable and unconditional surrender and oneness, this is undoubtedly the purest form of gratitude. And this gratitude is undoubtedly the fastest way not only to perfection, but to perfect Perfection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will some of us qualify to guard you and the Supreme in the inner world and the outer world simultaneously?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will some of us qualify to guard you and the Supreme in the inner world and the outer world simultaneously?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Dear Pravin, some of you have already qualified to guard me and the Supreme in me both in the inner world and in the outer world. Out of forty-five or fifty attendants, four have qualified and are guarding me both in the inner and the outer world, and one has half-qualified. The rest are guarding me only in the outer world. Among those who are doing it in the outer world, some are doing it successfully and some are not. The majority, unfortunately, are doing it unsuccessfully. But if today we are not successful, then tomorrow we will be successful and the day after tomorrow we will be more than successful; we shall be eternally fruitful in the Supreme and for the Supreme.</p>
<p>So right now four and a half disciples have proved themselves qualified both in the inner world and in the outer world to be guards. Others also have the same opportunity, for the capacity is already given. If you avail yourself of the opportunity, then your capacity will come to the fore. I will be extremely proud if all of you are qualified both inwardly and outwardly to be my divine assistants.</p>
<p>Since I have said four and a half are qualified, you as an individual can easily think that you are one of them. Even if it is not true, you will not create problems for yourself or problems for me. But if you think you are not qualified, your anxieties, your worries and your frustration will bring: your consciousness down. You may feel that today you are not my divine assistant in both the inner and outer world, but tomorrow you most assuredly will be. This is a good attitude also. And even if you feel that today you are one of those who are qualified both in the inner world and the outer world, still there is no end to your progress. You can say, "All right, I am there; I am an assistant both on the inner and outer planes. But let me become a better instrument, a more perfect instrument." That you can do.</p>
<p>But never enter into the world of inferiority, frustration, dissatisfaction and self-destruction. No! Be happy! If you are happy, then you will be able to bring forward your inner capacities and get enormous strength, the strength of a lion. Then it will be easier for you to do devoted service cheerfully; your happiness itself will enable you to do more selfless service in a spiritual way. Otherwise, you will work forty hours, fifty hours or sixty hours, but if it is not done in a cheerful, self-giving way you will get zero. It is your attitude that is of paramount importance, not how many hours you work. At the same time, I wish all my assistants to work at least seven hours a week, minimum. If one hour of selfless service you cannot give a day, that is really deplorable. Out of twenty-four hours if you cannot give one hour a day, then it is really unfortunate.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme has many, many qualities, which He will adopt according to the individual seeker's needs at different times of the day. In a general way you can say that the Supreme starts His journey with Compassion. Inside His Compassion is his Concern, and inside His Concern is His Sympathy, inside His Sympathy is His Justice-Light, inside His Justice-Light is His sense of Perfection and inside His Perfection is His Satisfaction. But there is no hard and fast rule. The Supreme can change everything if He wants to. The most important thing is for the seeker to be receptive so that he can receive whatever quality of the Supreme is best for his progress.</p>

Is this the thought actually leaving my consciousness?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Offering these thoughts to me is a very successful way of conquering them. Always throw them into me, me alone. When you throw your undivine thoughts into me, sometimes they may not actually leave your consciousness. But even if they do not actually leave, they are unnerved. They are frightened to death. If you continue throwing these undivine forces into me, then definitely there shall come a time when they all will either leave you or become totally transformed while they are inside you. It is like the transformation of night into day.</p>
<p>The most important thing right now is to be alert, conscious, sincere, devoted and self-giving to the supreme Cause. Then the Supreme in me, the Supreme in you, will do the needful. He will either cast aside the wrong forces or transform them into good, illumining and fulfilling forces.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are quite a few qualities which you have to develop in order to attain spiritual freedom, but three particular qualities are most important: dynamism in your outer life, a sincere and devoted oneness with the inner messages that you receive from the Supreme in me, and the transformation of your restless mind into a mind flooded with poise.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One can develop constant, confident inner poise if one cares only to listen to the soulful voice inside the heart. In order to listen to the soulful voice inside the heart, one must constantly feel that both the seeker-passenger and the Saviour-Pilot need each other for their realisation and manifestation. The seeker needs realisation, the Master needs manifestation. Again, the seeker has to realise that if the Master wants to change his instruments, he can easily get new instruments, illumining instruments and fulfilling instruments. But if the seeker wants to change Masters, he may not be blessed with a new Master all at once, for there are very few Masters in comparison to the number of seekers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The things you print can carry more of my vibration, dear Vishma, if you can convince yourself that you are working only to please the Supreme in me. Before you take up any job, meditate on the Supreme in me; while you are working meditate on the Supreme in me, and once you have finished your work also meditate on me. At your journey's start, during your journey's course and at your journey's end, if you can think of me even for a few fleeting seconds, then definitely the things that you print will be able to carry my vibration to a considerable extent.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have cheerfulness, you will make progress. And when you make progress, then your gratitude-heart expands. This is absolutely true. But when you want to see the capacity of gratitude and the capacity of cheerfulness, it is gratitude that is all-powerful. Gratitude has the power of all the oceans put together, whereas cheerfulness has the power of ten or twelve drops. Gratitude is unparalleled in God's creation, both in Heaven and on earth.</p>
<p>Again, there are many ways to develop gratitude-power, and cheerfulness is one of the ways. It is one of the strong ways to conquer frustration, depression, anxiety, worries and other negative qualities. It is a great help, and from this help we can develop gratitude-power.</p>
<p>Aspiration and gratitude are inseparable. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. Aspiration takes us high, higher than the highest; and gratitude takes us to the vast, to the vaster than the vastest. The aspiration-bird and the gratitude-bird are the same. When it spreads its Wings, it is gratitude, and when it flies up it is aspiration. But it is the same bird, the same inseparable reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are talking to a seeker, just imagine his heart. You don't have to look at his chest or his body in order to see or feel his heart. Just imagine the seeker's heart and then try to feel that what you have is only a heart. Make yourself feel that you do not have a body, you do not have a vital, you do not have a mind what you have is only a heart. Then feel that you, the heart, are becoming one with the heart that is beside you. Two hearts are conversing, and while conversing they are deriving much delight from each other. This delight is the most important thing, not only in God-realisation but also in God-manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Attendants' Song inspires and expedites the seeker-attendant's Godward march. To some extent it is true that the Invocation is all aspiration and the Attendants' Song is all dedication. Again, you have to know that dedication is nothing short of aspiration, for true aspiration is the glorious awakening of the seeker in the attendant and the glorious blossoming of the attendant's own divinity-reality based on his oneness with the Master, whose other names are attendant-lover, attendant-inspirer, attendant-fulfiller.</p>
<p>But you have to know that the <em>Invocation</em> was composed on an infinitely higher plane than the Attendants' Song. The <em>Invocation</em> not only knows what the Supreme has and is but also embodies Supreme the Eternal Road, Supreme the Infinite Divinity and Supreme the Immortal Reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes they are not beings at all, but only the souls of deceased relatives. Sometimes they are old and friendly acquaintances from the previous incarnations. Sometimes they are fate-making angels or deities. Sometimes they are fruitful imaginations of the seeker's soulful aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have made considerable progress in your life of inner search, but unfortunately you have a preconceived notion of inner progress. Do not have any preconceived ideas with regard to progress. You do not have to see, you do not have to feel. Just try to be always one with the soulfulness of your meditation-capacity and your dedication-sincerity. If you can do this, then automatically you will be able to trace, see and feel your progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your role and everybody's role is to become a divine instrument of the Supreme. In order to become a divine instrument of the Supreme, each individual needs something more than he needs something else. In each individual case, one particular divine quality is of paramount importance. In your case, purity is of paramount importance. Your lack of purity can destroy your aspiration, your dedication, everything. But if you can have purity, you can run fast, faster, fastest. Purity is the fastest road, whereas impurity is not only the slowest road, but it is actually the backward march. And the backward march leads not only to frustration, darkness but to destruction-night. So develop purity and try to run the fastest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God's Compassion always and always overrules the law of Karma. Had it been otherwise, no human being on earth could have lasted even for a single day. Again, from the highest spiritual point of view, you have to know that the law of Karma does not mean severe punishment. It is a necessary experience for the seeker; it is the only way to accelerate his progress. Therefore, the law of Karma itself is another form of God's Compassion. You may call it blessingful love in disguise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The surest way of doing selfless service selflessly is to cry not for success, not even for progress, but only for a continuous expansion of receptivity and for a continuous unfoldment of your soul's beauty-manifesting, selfless duty.</p>
