  <h2 id="page-title">Faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Faith is the eye that sees the future manifestation of the Divine on earth.</p>
<p>Faith lives in the domain of the soul. This domain is a far cry from that of the intellect.</p>
<p>Faith is no wishful imagination. It is the soul's pre-vision.</p>
<p>Faith spontaneously feels God, senses that God's protection and His guidance are indivisible. Belief thinks "Maybe. I am not quite sure."</p>
<p>Faith says, "All obstacles, inner or outer, can be surmounted." Belief says, "Not so easy."</p>
<p>The real strength of faith can be neither measured nor experienced.</p>
<p>Faith and Will are the two invaluable eyes of an aspirant.</p>
<p>Doubt sleeps with our human nature. Faith lives with its self-offering.</p>
<p>Mere mental knowledge is a real stranger to faith which is itself the knowledge of the soul.</p>
<p>Faith and perfect equanimity are not only inseparable, but indispensable to each other.</p>
<p>Faith can kill fear in season and out of season, and not vice-versa.</p>
<p>Courage is the arrow. Faith is the bow.</p>
<p>The worst enemy of ignorance and failure is faith.</p>
<p>To say that the outer intellect is stone blind is not an error. To say that faith has one thousand eyes is to state the immaculate truth.</p>
<p>To be a successful believer, one has only to be a child. To be a successful disbeliever, one has only to listen to his own pre-conceived ideas.</p>
<p>It is not your mental belief but your faith that is the ever-loyal support to your surrender in the process of your self-fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">My subway experiences</h2><span property="dc:title" content="My subway experiences" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p>
In this series of six anecdotes, Sri Chinmoy tells of his amusing (and sometimes frightening) experiences in the New York City subways during the years 1964-65.</p>
<h2>I. Absent-minded hero</h2>

<p>I bought a token and slipped it into the slot at one turnstile. However, in my unmindfulness, I was attempting to pass through an adjacent turnstile. Needless to say, my turnstile refused to move, but I failed to grasp the situation.</p>
<p>Suddenly a young guy slapped me in a comradely way on the back, and saying, "Thank you!" crossed through the turnstile in which my token had been deposited. Thus he escaped without paying for himself and I was forced to buy another token. Unmindfulness exacted its retribution.</p>
<p>On another occasion almost the very same thing happened. Again I put my token in one box and tried to pass through an adjacent turnstile. But this time an elderly man saw my difficulty. He put his own token in my box, enabling me to cross, while he used my token to pass through his turnstile. Unmindfulness called forth sympathy and genuine help.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">II. Mad train versus God&#039;s Will</h2><span property="dc:title" content="II. Mad train versus God&#039;s Will" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>It was a local uptown train of the IRT line at 12:30 midnight. Our train was meant to halt in normal fashion at every stop, but at 42nd Street, Times Square, we began what was to be our mad journey. The train flew on like a monster released from its controls and refused to stop. I was supposed to get off at 79th Street, but the train had its own plan. Each station was passed by at top speed, unheeded. Our train defeated even the Express, which stops at the main junctions. Ours refused to slow down, let alone stop, but continued on like a mad elephant.</p>
<p>The young boys and girls in the coach were in the seventh heaven of delight. But the older ones were frantic. They were being taken miles out of their way and there was no certainty that they would get trams in the reverse direction without great difficulty. Moreover, because of the wild speed, they felt an accident to be imminent. What if our train should meet its predecessor parked at a station?</p>
<p>Strangely enough, an old Bengali woman happened, to be in our coach. I later found out that she came from Potia, Chittagong, East Bengal, only four miles from my birthplace. We were both in a runaway train in New York only 13,000 miles from our native place. Imagine my surprise when I heard her cry out in our distinctive Chittagong dialect, "O Lord, O Lord, we are finished!"</p>
<p>I went to her and by way of joke, I answered in the same vernacular, "God will not be satisfied with your life alone, but He wants ours as well." When she heard her own dialect, tears of astonished delight came into her eyes and she could not help embracing me with motherly affection. I tried to soothe and reassure her but her cries and tears did not cease. Nor did the panic stricken cries of several other women in the coach.</p>
<p>At 130th Street the mad driver stopped his wild journey only to be arrested by two policemen. Word had been sent by inter-subway telephone from one station to another about the erring train. The police had been informed and had tried unsuccessfully to stop the driver at various places along the line. Curiously enough, the driver was not drunk. It seemed that an unseen force made him the instrument of that fateful journey in which he wanted to be free from all bondages and fly unhampered and dauntless into the bosom of the Night.</p>
<p>On this trip, our invitation to death was compelled by a single individual, but God's Grace willed otherwise and cancelled the rendezvous.</p>

<h2>Editor's notes</h2>

<p>On May 22, 1967, Sri Chinmoy gave an invited talk to the School of Self-Defense, 280 Closter Dock Road. Closter, New Jersey. This school, under the direction of Mr. Michael Depasquale, a Police officer, teaches Jiu Jitsu, Karate, and other forms of self-defense.</p>
<p>The members of the school, men, women and children, were interested to learn, not only about Hatha Yoga (the ancient Hindu system of physical postures and breathing exercises) but also about the Indian spiritual disciplines and the various forms of Yoga, apart from. Hatha Yoga.</p>
<p>On May 24, 1967, the Guru addressed the Universalist Church of New York City, at the invitation of its director, the Reverend Leonard Helie, on the subject of “The Universality of Religion.”</p>
<p>The Aum Centre wishes to express its deepest thanks to Mrs. Fay vom Saal and Mrs. Arnold for their most generous services in arranging for the talk and preparing the Indian refreshments.</p>
