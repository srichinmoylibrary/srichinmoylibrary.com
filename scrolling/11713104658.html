<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no, no. It is like passing through a garden on your way to a temple. When you see the flowers in the garden, they can inspire you. When you are inspired, you may be able to run very fast towards your destination. But if the destination is still far away, you may say, "Let me stay here indefinitely and enjoy the beauty and fragrance of these flowers."</p>
<p>Similarly, if angels come to you on your way to the destination, like the flowers, they may inspire you to go faster. Again, they may charm you to such an extent that you may say, "They are so beautiful. Let me stop here for some time and chat with them." Some runners can easily run faster, but they enjoy chatting with the slower runners.</p>
<p>The beauty and fragrance of a garden can inspire you to go faster. Again, they can charm you to such an extent that you say, "All right, the destination is there. I will reach it sooner or later. In the meantime, the best thing is to enjoy this garden. Who knows, when I reach the temple, perhaps I will not see such beautiful flowers there."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to have utmost inner wealth, the best thing is to go to the Highest, the Absolute. Instead of going to an angel for two hundred dollars, why not go to the One who has billions of dollars?</p>
<p>We have to be so wise. If our goal is only to have a small amount, then we shall go to the one who has only two hundred dollars. It depends on how much inner hunger we have. If I am extremely hungry, then I will try to go to a place where I will get a most delicious meal. If I am not hungry, then a cup of tea is enough for me. It depends on our inner hunger and how much inner wealth we want.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are there different angels connected with animals as opposed to human beings?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are there different angels connected with animals as opposed to human beings?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels deal mostly with human beings. Very, very rarely do angels deal with animals. Even when angels come to human beings, they are afraid that these human beings may misuse their compassion, affection and concern. To come down to the human level and see if human beings are a little receptive — that much angels will be able to do. But they are afraid of the animal kingdom. Some animals are really receptive — they are so adorable. But in general the animal kingdom has so much hostility.</p>
<p>Human beings also have hostility, but they may hide it. If I am angry with someone, he may not be able to see it. But if a dog is angry with someone, no matter how many people are there, the dog will just bite. Animals cannot hide their nature, while human beings can. Human beings express their hostility secretly, while animals do it openly. So angels very rarely deal with the animal kingdom. Even when angels want to bring light to human beings, they are afraid of being grabbed and strangled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do angels ever fight directly with the hostile forces or do they just help people?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do angels ever fight directly with the hostile forces or do they just help people?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes they fight directly with the hostile forces, and sometimes they help human beings to fight the hostile forces. When they help human beings to fight against the hostile forces, it is like one country that is richer helping another country. Right now America is infinitely richer than Russia. So America will give financial help to the Russian government to fight against hunger and poverty.</p>
<p>But if you take hunger and poverty as undivine forces, then you can also try to fight them directly with material wealth, food, clothes and so on. You will not go through another government or agency. You will go directly with all your wealth to fight against those undivine forces. Hunger is not an undivine force as such, but lack of food does take away our joy. Anything that is taking away our joy is a hostile force.</p>
<p>When they have more love for certain human beings, angels will fight against the hostile forces directly instead of giving those individuals the necessary inner strength. It depends on how much love an angel has for a particular person. The head of one government may give a million dollars to the head of another government whose citizens are suffering and say, "Now use it. We will not give any more." But if it is that person's wife or daughter who is suffering, no matter how many millions of dollars it takes, he will give everything to cure his daughter. He will fight directly against his daughter's disease.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: After someone becomes your disciple, does their guardian angel leave, or does he establish a relationship with you, or does he just say, &quot;You do not need me any more&quot;?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: After someone becomes your disciple, does their guardian angel leave, or does he establish a relationship with you, or does he just say, &amp;quot;You do not need me any more&amp;quot;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My job is only to place each and every disciple who has accepted me as their teacher at the Feet of the Supreme. As soon as I accept someone, I place that person consciously at the Feet of the Supreme. I am not the Supreme, but I know a little more that you do because I have prayed and meditated more than you have. I always say that I am like the eldest brother in the family. You are my younger brothers and sisters. I know a little more about our Father than you do.</p>
<p>As soon as I place you at the Feet of the Father, then my role is over. Just as I was able to sit at the Feet of the Father, touch His Feet and kiss His Feet, you will also be able to do the same. Once I place you at the Feet of the Supreme, since He has everything and He is everything, why do you have to again think of the one who helped you?</p>
<p>Let us say you want to see a particular house. You ask someone, "Where is 150th Street?" He says, "Go this side, then go that side and you will reach it." Once you come to the correct place, you are grateful. But did that person bring you there? Perhaps five miles away you asked that person where 150th Street is and he gave you instructions. He did not say, "Come into my car. I will bring you to the destination." He said, "Go this side, make a left turn, go to this street and that street." Just because he gave me directions, I am grateful to him.</p>
<p>Angels are like that person who gave directions. You can be grateful to them because they told you how to reach the destination, but they did not bring you on their shoulders to your destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Once I have placed you at the Feet of the Supreme, I am also unnecessary. I am like the guard who opens the door for you to come into the room where the boss is. Then if you are at the feet of the boss and you become a favourite of the boss, at that time why do you need the guard? The boss will tell the guard, "Whenever he wants to go out, he can go out, and whenever he wants to come in, he can come in."</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do all angels get along with each other?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do all angels get along with each other?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Even cosmic gods fight, and they are infinitely higher than angels! Every second the cosmic gods are cursing, every second they are showing their supremacy. Then, among individual human beings, sometimes someone who has peace thinks that he is the strongest. He feels as if he will be able to swallow all the conflicts and misunderstandings of the world. The next moment, when someone has got power, he feels that he has conquered the whole world. Then a third person may have love, so he becomes universal oneness with all. Even when we are surcharged with different aspects of divinity, we can exercise our feeling of supremacy.</p>
<p>By nature angels do not quarrel or fight like cats and dogs, but the feeling of supremacy may be there. Again, inside the feeling of supremacy there can be oneness. A father knows he is much stronger than a child. For that very reason he does not fight with the child, and the child does not fight with the father. This kind of oneness they have.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some countries are more influenced by angels, specially in the Christian world. Christianity has given much more importance to the angels than other religions. So if Christian feeling predominates in a certain country, the angelic power is more perceptible there. The Christian world will have more of a free access to the angel world in their mind, in their conception, whereas other countries will not have that same access. Any culture that is dominated by the Christian feeling will have more feeling for angels, and they will get more happiness from the angel life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the case of some prominent people, angels really had a great influence, like the French girl, Joan of Arc. In her case, the angelic touch was there. She received help both from angels and fairies. Angels found it more difficult to establish a direct connection with her. As I said before, fairies have a more direct connection with human beings because fairies are not as high as angels. Fairies can come and touch the human level. That is why in the life of Joan of Arc you saw more of what we can call a dynamic aspect, a solid aspect. This solid aspect came from the angel world and then it came to the fairy world. It came step by step. If you come step by step, it is one thing. Another way is if you jump, omitting two or three steps. If angels have to come directly to the human level, they have to omit two or three steps. But it is risky for them. Whereas if they come to the second step, then the fairies who are on the second step can easily come to the first step and it is solid.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because she had so much faith in angels. If I have faith in someone, then God will send that person to me because I will be more convinced that it is true. Then again, in this case, Joseph had more faith in angels than Mary had because he was simpler. Sometimes doubt was entering into Mary, whether the Saviour was actually coming. In the beginning Joseph wanted to discard Mary because it was not his child. Then an angel had to convince him that the child was destined to be the Saviour. After that his faith was stronger than Mary's.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When they want to fly, they spread their wings. When they do not want to fly, they can keep them folded. Angel wings are delicate, but strong at the same time. They are much, much more beautiful than the fairies' wings. Fairy wings are choppy. It is as if somebody is painting in a very choppy way. Fairies do not believe in delicacy.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies exist more in the vital world. Angels exist in the psychic world. Angels will appear at the time of our death or when something very significant is happening in our life. When I am dying, do I want to see a fairy? No, I will pray for the Supreme to come. If the Supreme does not come, at least He can send some cosmic gods and goddesses. If that also He does not do, He will then send some angels.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Throughout history people have thought they saw the Virgin Mary. Was it angels they saw and not the Virgin Mary?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Throughout history people have thought they saw the Virgin Mary. Was it angels they saw and not the Virgin Mary?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It was not angels who took the form of Mother Mary. Again, it was not Mother Mary as such. It was God Himself. God took the form of Mother Mary. This kind of apparition entirely depends on how much faith people have in Mother Mary. When you have implicit faith in her, God takes that form because He does not want the seeker to be disappointed.</p>
<p>If God takes His own omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent Form, people will become frightened. So He takes the form of a particular human body, like Mother Mary. People have a concept of Mother Mary because they have seen so many paintings and sculptures of her. Mother Mary's face does not frighten us, but if a huge Form comes, we get frightened. If a seeker has faith in Mother Mary, the easiest and wisest way is for God to take the form of Mother Mary. That will be more convincing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. But we will not be able to appreciate their food. Their food is not material. They get their food from the ether. In between this physical earth and the higher realms, there is a substance called ether. It is not like ordinary air. That ether contains all kinds of energy. It can be taken as solid food or liquid food. It is part of the cosmic life-energy.</p>
