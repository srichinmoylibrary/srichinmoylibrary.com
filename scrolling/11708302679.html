  <h2 id="page-title">Question: As a pianist, sometimes I am so caught up with technique that I lose the soul or forget what I am trying to say.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: As a pianist, sometimes I am so caught up with technique that I lose the soul or forget what I am trying to say." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you can meditate for three or four minutes before you play, your mind will be inundated with light. Then your mind will be clear and confusion will not dare to enter into it. At that time, you do not have to think of the technique; it will come automatically. Everything comes from light — even technique. The light will pull the technique.</p>
<p>If the owner or manager of a restaurant asks one of his workers to do something, immediately the worker will try to please him. Similarly, when you embody light, the light within you will command the technique to perform for you, and you will go far beyond the domain of technique. Now you are thinking about technique; you are begging it to serve you. But at that time, technique will be dying to serve you and please you because you are the boss.</p>
<p>Spending a minute or two in silence is like putting money in your pocket. If you have money in your pocket, in the supermarket you can buy anything you want. When you meditate for two or three minutes, you accumulate inner wealth — peace, light and bliss. Then, as soon as you stand in front of the audience — before you play even — spontaneously you are sharing this wealth with them. So before you even start to perform, you have already pleased your audience. Then, even if you play wrong notes, they will be sympathetic towards you.</p>
<p>It is like a mother and her child. The child makes a million mistakes when he plays an instrument, but the mother thinks, “Oh, it is so excellent!” The mother’s love for the child makes her feel that whatever the child does is perfect. So if you distribute your inner wealth before you play, the audience is not going to judge you because it is already satisfied. You can play anything you want and the audience will be pleased.</p>
<p>When I play for my students, they do not care how many mistakes I make. Why? Because before I play, I meditate with them and we establish our oneness with one another. So right from the beginning there is mutual satisfaction. At that time, they are so inwardly happy and satisfied that no matter how bad my outer performance is, their mind and heart are happy. And when you are happy and filled with inner delight, you do not see any mistakes. When you are in a very high state of consciousness, nothing affects you; everything is joy.</p>
<p>It is like a host trying to please his guests as soon as they come in. If the host stands at the door and gives them a flower or a smile and talks to them, then half the battle is won. No matter what else he does, everything is perfect because he has already conquered the hearts of his guests. But if the guests are pouring in and the host is somewhere else, they will say, “Look at this! He is so callous and irresponsible!”</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has nervousness, but by virtue of prayer and meditation you can conquer nervousness — to a great extent or completely. In addition to prayer and meditation, there is also something you can do on the practical level. Instead of seeing a thousand people in the audience, imagine that there is only one person, one listener. Then feel that this one person is not even a musician. He is not somebody who will find fault with you; he is just an ordinary person. Since you are an infinitely better musician than he is, why do you have to worry? Or feel that he is your greatest admirer and you are playing for him out of sheer compassion. You should do this not in an aggressive way but in a sympathetic way. So from a thousand people in the audience, bring the number down to one person, and feel that that person is your most sincere admirer.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to have silence, not sound. Sound can be silenced by silence itself. When you meditate, there is tremendous silence. On the surface there are huge waves, but the waves are only a very small part of the ocean. At the bottom of the ocean there is deep silence.</p>
<p>You are talking about paying bills and so many other things that you have to do. You have to think of these things as monkeys that are biting you; they are not biting your body but your mind. If you pick up a big solid stick, the monkeys become frightened and stop biting you. In this case, the stick is your inner silence. When you keep your mind absolutely quiet, you will know what is most important. You are a musician and not a secretary or a politician. If you do not answer certain letters, your world will not collapse. But if you do not pay attention to your music first and foremost, then you will be the real loser. Again, you have to be practical and pay your bills. But the money for this comes from your music. So always you have to go to the source. Music is the source of your inner life and also the source of your outer life.</p>
<p>If you pay utmost attention to your music, from your music-world you will get tremendous joy. Then, if you are happy, you will pick up a particular letter that came three months ago or six months ago and answer it. But if you are unhappy, you are not going to touch anything. So first you have to derive joy from your music. Then, once your mind is inundated with joy, everything else will come easily. But if you do not do first things first, which in your case is music, then everything will go wrong.</p>
<p>I have one particular song that is the source of all my musical pieces; it is called <em>The Invocation.</em> I sing <em>The Invocation</em> every day, as well as play it and listen to it on tape. Before that I meditate. All my disciples early in the morning also sing that song in front of their shrines. Then their outer world and inner world become in tune with the universal harmony. For me and my students, the highest type of music is meditation. Life without meditation is out of tune with the inner harmony.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my case, I am dealing with the Source, which is inexhaustible. Every day I am entering into my heart-garden, where there are so many beautiful and fragrant flowers. If every day we enter into our heart-garden by virtue of our prayer and meditation, we will constantly get a fresh supply of inner beauty and inner purity. If we cannot enter into the inmost recesses of our heart, if we just enter into the mind-jungle, we will only occasionally find flowers. To have flowers all the time, we have to enter into the heart. The heart is all freshness and newness because of its oneness with the universal spirit. Every day it offers us a newly blossoming dawn.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One day we climb up the life-tree and another day we climb down. We have to be wise. When we climb up to the top of the tree, we have to feel that we are plucking the fruits. Then, when we are coming down, instead of feeling miserable, we have to feel that we are distributing the fruits that we collected. There is a joy in achieving and there is a joy in giving. So when we are up, we are achieving; when we are down, we are giving. But if we do not take that attitude, then when we are down we feel miserable because we have nothing to do. No, we do have something to do — we have to share our wealth with the rest of humanity!</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the father gives the child a piece of candy and the child gives the father a sweet smile, that smile will conquer the father’s heart. For the child, his smile is all he has. So when he smiles at the father, he is giving the father all his wealth.</p>
<p>When we follow the spiritual life, we come to realise that we never give anything to a third party; the giver and the receiver are the same person. God is in everybody. This moment God is playing the role of the giver inside me, and the next moment He is playing the role of the receiver inside you. Then it is reversed. It is like taking from the left hand and giving to the right hand. Again, God the giver cannot be happy unless God the receiver takes what is offered. When the father gives something to the child, if the child does not take it, the father will feel sad. But when the child takes and is happy, the father is also happy. So it is reciprocal happiness, in which the giver and the taker are of equal importance.</p>
<p>If you are playing a masterpiece and the audience is not receptive, then you are very sad. Only if the audience is very, very attentive and receiving joy from your playing will you also get tremendous joy. So the joy has to be mutual. Everything in life we have to share. What you have, you have to share with me. What I have, I have to share with you. Otherwise, there is no happiness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Somebody has to start. In a relay race there will be four people. But one has to start. If everybody starts at the same time, everybody will collide and it will be chaos. One completes the circle around the track and then the next one starts. The whole world is going around like this. But one has to start with his self-giving heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is only a matter of time. The eagerness and self-giving of the musicians, poets and artists will eventually conquer the public’s restlessness or unwillingness. If the performer has readiness, willingness and eagerness, then he is bound to win over the heart of the audience. Right now the audience is like a naughty child, but if the mother is extremely kind-hearted and has infinite patience, eventually the mother is going to win. The mother’s compassionate tears or her smile will eventually conquer the heart of the child.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Exactly! In everything we do, we need patience. In the beginning, when a child tries to stand up, he falls down again and again. After falling down a number of times, he could say, “No, I am not going to try to get up anymore.” But he has a tremendous inner urge to walk. He sees his father, mother and elder brother all walking and he, too, wants to go forward. The patience that a child exercises unconsciously, a grown-up has to exercise consciously.</p>
<p>For a child patience is natural because he is all the time in the heart. But because adults live in the mind, they have to try so hard to get back those heart-qualities. When we are in the mind, everything becomes crooked and distorted. So we have to bring the unruly mind under the control of the heart.</p>

SCA 389-394. Questions answered on 26 May 1996.</p>
<h2>Question: Guru, did you have many high experiences before God-realisation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I had quite a few experiences before I became aware of my God-realisation. I have already written about a few of these experiences. One of my highest was the time I wanted to leave earth, and Mother Earth was asking me to stay here to work for manifestation. The experiences that I wrote about in my poems “The Absolute” and “Immortality” were also extremely high experiences.</p>
<p>I also had a high experience just three months after I entered the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. The young boys and girls in the Ashram had to do selfless service, and my job was to work in the paddy field. While I was working in the paddy field, I noticed that one of the mango trees was bending down. I just looked at the tree and everywhere in the tree — in all the fruits and leaves — I saw my Lord Krishna. Krishna was here, Krishna was there; everywhere I was seeing Lord Krishna! Before that, I was not thinking of Krishna at all; I was meditating on Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. But when I saw Lord Krishna everywhere, I was so thrilled. My dearest boyhood friend was right beside me. I was telling him, “Look, look, look at what I am seeing!” He had such love for me that he did not think of challenging me or saying that it was a mental hallucination. But he himself did not see anything. This experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>Another time, while I was meditating inside the Ashram meditation hall, my inner being was going up high, higher, highest. I was absolutely swimming in the sea of ecstasy. I said, “I can never go higher than this.” I was so satisfied with that height.” O God, then I saw that this height was only the starting point! In a fleeting second, I went even higher. Like this, it went on for about twenty minutes or half an hour. Each time I reached a new height, the human in me was so satisfied. The human in me said, “It is enough, enough, enough!” But I was still going up. Each time I reached a particular height, which more than satisfied the human in me, the divine in me gave me a push to go again higher. That particular experience I will also never forget!</p>
<p>I have told many times about how Mother Saraswati gave me all her wisdom and inner capacities. She came down and played for me and then broke her vina into pieces and emptied it into me. I was in my very, very highest consciousness at the time.</p>
<p>These inner experiences helped me considerably. Once you get this kind of high, solid experience, then you know you are safe and that one day you will realise absolutely the Highest. But when you fully realise your height and it becomes settled, many of these earlier experiences disappear. If you want to remember even the minor experiences, you can; but usually you discard them. If you get thousands of hundred-dollar bills, you will not start counting your dimes, nickels and pennies. After you get realisation, you feel that most of these experiences were so silly — like tiny drops. Even the highest experiences you get before God-realisation are like tiny drops! This is what happens.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Are inner experiences a prerequisite to God-realisation or are they not at all necessary?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Are inner experiences a prerequisite to God-realisation or are they not at all necessary?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people are blessed with hundreds of experiences or even more. Some people get ten or twenty experiences. Again, some people may have only a few major experiences before God-realisation, but those experiences are most important in their life. So it depends on the individual. But usually one gets at least four or five major experiences before achieving God-realisation or remembering the God-realisation that one had attained in a previous incarnation.</p>
<p>Again, some people get major experiences that last for days or weeks, and then their consciousness descends and for a long time they do not get any high experiences. At that time they feel absolutely miserable. Vivekananda used to go through dry periods that lasted for as long as six months. But he used to play a kind of trick on himself. He used to remind himself of the highest experiences that he had in the past, when Sri Ramakrishna had touched him on the head, and he would make himself feel that he was having those experiences again. For a half hour, an hour or two hours he was only imagining, imagining and imagining. He had such tremendous will-power that those experiences became vivid and alive, and he was able to live inside them once again.</p>
<p>So if you are not getting any inner experiences now, try to remember the experiences that you have already had and use your imagination-power to bring them back. Then, not only will those experiences come back, but they will help you go forward into another experience, which will be infinitely stronger, more illumining and more beautiful.</p>
<p>One does not need fifty or a hundred inner experiences to achieve God-realisation, but experiences definitely help. While we are walking along Eternity’s Road, if we see some shady trees and beautiful flowers, then we get tremendous joy. Some people feel that those beautiful flowers and trees are only temptations. They say, “If I smell the flowers, I am afraid I will get caught or stuck there. While I am appreciating the beauty of the flowers, my fellow travellers will go far ahead of me. I do not need this kind of experience.” But some are wise. They say, “If here the flowers are so beautiful, the flowers at the destination will be infinitely more beautiful and fragrant.” So they appreciate the flowers and then go forward.</p>
<p>Inner experiences do help us; they give us a kind of fruit. If we do not like a particular experience, we can just discard it. And if we like a particular experience, we can try to have it again. Some experiences are so strong and powerful that they can change human nature totally. If we have an experience like this, it may change our life entirely — both inwardly and outwardly. Some of my disciples have been on our path for twenty or twenty-five years, and perhaps they have not run very fast during this time. But if they can get a single experience of the highest order and maintain it for one week or two weeks, they can make more progress in those two weeks than they have made for the past twenty-five years. Unfortunately, we have no idea at what point such an experience will occur. It is like striking a match. If we do not strike the right part of the matchbox, the match will not light. Similarly, if we do not turn the knob on the stove to a certain point, the stove will not ignite. If we turn it just a little, no flame comes; but if we turn it just a little more, then the flame appears.</p>

How is this possible?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some of the disciples on our path say, “For the first year or two after I joined the path, I was so full of love, devotion and surrender. At that time, I was trying to conquer jealousy; I was trying to conquer insecurity. If any weakness appeared, I tried to control it. In every way I was trying to be divine.” But after practising spirituality for twenty or thirty years, these unfortunate disciples come to believe that these weaknesses are part of human nature. They feel, “If I have not conquered my jealousy, insecurity and so on in thirty years, why should I believe that I will succeed after another thirty years?”</p>
<p>What is worse, in some cases these negative forces have grown stronger with passing time. Some disciples feel that they have more jealousy, more insecurity, more impurity than they had twenty or thirty years ago. How did this happen? One reason is that relaxation entered into their life, and they are no longer on their guard against these forces. Also, in some cases the disciples have given up and surrendered to these forces. When we surrender to the hostile forces, naturally they become more powerful.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can the mind help us discover God’s Will?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can the mind help us discover God’s Will?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of the time we have no idea what God’s Will is. The mind comes forward and tells us, “Such and such is God’s Will.” But if we dive deep within, we see that the mind is one hundred per cent wrong. Even the heart can be wrong. And the vital and the physical are always wrong. But if one can see the soul and talk to the soul during meditation, then the soul will tell us, “This is right, this is wrong.”</p>
<p>The mind is like a primary school teacher. There are many questions that the primary school teacher cannot answer. The heart is like a high school teacher. Then comes the soul, which is like a college teacher, and the Supreme, who is like a university professor. The mind is so bad; it does everything it can to prevent us from learning from the heart. It says, “Only after you have learnt everything from me should you go to the next class.” Then, when the mind sees that somebody is a good student and is ready to go on to high school, the mind deliberately fails the student in order to keep him longer. Then after a few years, the student gets disgusted; he feels he will never get past primary school. This is the time when many, many seekers give up the spiritual life. They give up because the mind makes them feel that they cannot go even to high school, whereas college is out of the question.</p>
<p>Many times the mind-teacher does not know the answer, but it makes us feel that it does know the answer. A question that comes from the depths of our heart, the mind can never answer. But the mind makes us feel that it knows everything. So it is all the time giving us faulty lessons. In spite of this, the mind tells us, “My answers are perfect, perfect, perfect!” At every moment we are making mistakes because we are entrusting the mind with our whole life.</p>
<p>The mind wants to get joy in a specific way. The mind says, “This is the only way. There is no other way.” Like a dictator, the mind has spoken! Then the soul or the Master comes along and shows us another way. Immediately the mind says, “O my God, it is impossible, impossible!” The mind keeps one door open and says we must pass through this door; it does not allow us to see other ways. There may be many doors in a big mansion, but the mind does not allow us to use them; it keeps those doors under lock and key. But when the soul sees that we are desperately trying to go beyond the mind, then the soul opens up this door and that door for us. It does not have to be a door, no! When the soul opens up even a new window, at that time how happy we are!</p>
<p>When we cannot go beyond the boundaries of the mind, we are completely trapped. It is like being under arrest. The only thing we can do is pray to someone to come and release us, and that someone is either the Master or the Supreme. It does not matter to whom we pray, because the Supreme’s Grace is also acting in and through the Master.</p>
<p>I have always said that there cannot be any higher prayer than the Saviour Jesus Christ’s prayer: “Let Thy Will be done.” But if a farmer only sits in his cottage repeating, “Let Thy Will be done,” he will never get a bumper crop. No, the farmer has to plough his field, bring water and manure and do the needful. Only then, after he has done as much as he can, after he has done his best, is he entitled to say, “Let Thy Will be done!”</p>
<p>We should say this prayer after we do everything that we feel from within we can do, only after we use all the capacity that God has given us. At that time we can say, “O God, You have given me the capacity to do this, and I have done it. Now I cannot go any farther, higher or deeper. Let Thy Will be done.” Then God comes and gives us much more capacity, inwardly and outwardly.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Most spiritual Masters have said that without renunciation one cannot get realisation, but your philosophy is that we have to accept and transform life.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Most spiritual Masters have said that without renunciation one cannot get realisation, but your philosophy is that we have to accept and transform life." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our philosophy is the philosophy of acceptance. We have to accept life and transform it. That is absolutely true. But in order to accept something, we may also have to reject something. When the higher call came, Lord Buddha renounced his wife and child, for he felt that the whole universe belonged to him. But if he claims the whole universe as his own, very own, is he not also accepting his wife and child, who are part of that universe?</p>
<p>So we have to know what acceptance truly is. If we want to accept the vastness, there are a few things that we have to renounce. But we are not actually renouncing them; we are only keeping them in their proper place so they also can aspire for light. At this moment, let us say, I am ready to aspire for light. But if I wait for my brother or my sister or my dear one, then God will say, “You fool! I have called you; your hour has come. Why are you delaying? When it is your dear one’s hour, at that time I will call him.”</p>
<p>When God’s Hour strikes, at that time we do not even choose to take God’s side. No, God just takes our side. He has dropped the atom bomb of light, and we become so happy that we become one with His Will.</p>
<p>When Lord Krishna played upon the flute, the gopis ran to be with him because they were ready. But people who were not ready did not come. He played upon the flute for everybody, but only those who were ready came running. The Grace of the Supreme is descending; the divine Light is descending. Some people are ready to open their doors and windows, and others are not. Some are invoking that Light to come and enter into them, but millions and billions are not doing this. They say, “We do not need it.” For them God’s Hour has not yet struck.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we overcome insecurity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we overcome insecurity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Insecurity comes when we divide ourselves from others and feel that others are superior to us or stronger than we are. But if we can have a childlike heart and feel our oneness with others, then we can never be insecure. A boy of five or six is not insecure when he sees how strong his father is. No, the boy feels that his father’s strength is all his. If his father buys a brand new car, the boy tells the world, “This is my car.” He has identified himself with his father to such an extent that he does not hesitate to claim his father’s car as his own. His father will not say, “You fool, is it your car?” On the contrary, the father is so proud that the child is claiming the father’s possession as his own. Similarly, if we claim God as our own, very own, He will give us His Infinity, His Immortality, His All. But, alas, we do not claim Him; we simply try to get one drop of nectar-delight from Him and then we separate ourselves. That is why we are insecure.</p>
