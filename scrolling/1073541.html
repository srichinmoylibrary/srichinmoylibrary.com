<p>God, do You have a minute? I have to ask You something. My mother says that I have to love You every single day. Is she right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your mother is right.”</p>
<p>“How can I love You when I don’t know You very well?”</p>
<p>“Let Me tell you what to do. It is true that you don’t know Me well, but you know your mother pretty well. From today on, try to love your mother more. The amount of love that she needs from you she will keep for herself, and the rest she will give to Me. We shall share your love. O.K.?”</p>

<p>God, my mother constantly bothers me. She tells me that I have to pray to You every morning and evening. She also says that if I do that, I shall be able to see You every day. She has told me something else. She has told me that You are very kind. If it’s true, will You please do me a favour? Can You tell me how I can see You every day without praying to You?”</p>
<p>“I shall let you see Me not once, but twice a day. But you have to pray to Me a little. Wait, I have a nice idea. I am telling you secretly that I am going to give you the easiest prayer. You must not tell it to anybody; this is all between you and Me, a top secret.</p>
<p>“Every morning, you stand in front of the large mirror in the living room and keep your eyes half open. Look at your eyes in the mirror and smile and smile. You are sure to see Me in your eyes. First you will see Me in your right eye, and then in your left eye.”</p>
<p>“Will it always be like that? Can I not see You first in my left eye and then in my right eye?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but to do that, you have to keep both eyes closed and repeat My Name seven times, and then open your eyes. You are bound to see Me in your left eye first.”</p>
<p>“God, do You mind if I do it the other way around? I hope You won’t mind if I keep my eyes half open and smile until I see You. I think that will be easier. Do You mind?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all. I must say that you are wiser than I! I wanted to show you the easiest way to see Me. I wanted you to stand in front of the mirror and keep your eyes half open. You don’t want to take even that much trouble. You just want to keep your eyes half open and smile until you see Me! You have discovered a way which is even easier! You are really clever and great, Edward, and that is why I am fond and proud of you.”</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, God.”</p>

<p>“Never! I love You more than You love me.”</p>
<p>“You are wrong, Stephanie.”</p>
<p>“No, God, You are wrong. God, You know that I pray to my Guru every day. He comes to see me only two times a year. So You see, I love him more than he loves me. I pray to You every day. But You have come to see me only today for the first time. So You see, I love You more than You love me.”</p>
<p>“My sweetest child Stephanie, every night your Guru and I come to see you while you are fast asleep.”</p>

<p>God shows His big, powerful and frightening Eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see. You have the same eyes as my Guru Chinmoy has. God, tell me frankly, is it true that You know much more than my Guru?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know much more than your Guru Chinmoy, and I have much more than he has. He has learned everything from Me, and I have given him everything that he now has. I also have the power to take away everything from him if he wrongly uses it.”</p>
<p>“God, don’t be so nasty. Chinmoy is so kind to me, so nice to me. I love him. We all love him. God, don’t You ever take away anything from him, please, please!”</p>

<p>“God, I am sick of my father and my mother. I am only seven years old. You know I am just a child. My mother tells me that I have to leave my room clean and tidy. My father tells me that I have to take a shower every day. And You know, God, that my mother uses the biggest word in the dictionary. She uses the word ‘immaculate’. God, do You know what that silly word means?”</p>
<p>“I think I do.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me what it means.”</p>
<p>“It means ‘spotless’.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. Thank You, God. Oh, I forgot to ask You God, if my parents are right in making me take a shower and leave my room clean and tidy every day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are right.”</p>
<p>“I see that You are also no good. You and my father and my mother are all the same. Tell me, did my father take a shower every day when he was a little boy? Did my mother clean her room when she was a little girl?”</p>
<p>“No, your father did not take a shower and your mother did not clean her room daily when they were of your age.”</p>
<p>“Then why do they want all that from me? It isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>“You know, that is why I did not like your father and mother for a long time. I only began liking them when they started taking showers and cleaning their rooms daily.”</p>
<p>“But I want You to like me right from the beginning, God.”</p>
<p>“I shall not only like you, but love you, if you take a shower and leave your room clean and tidy every day. More than that, I shall be proud of you.”</p>
<p>“Thank You, thank You, thank You, God.”</p>

<p>“God, I have a real problem. My mother tells me that I must spend more time in my praying to You. My father tells me that the time that I spend in my praying to You is more than enough. God, who is right, my mother or my father? Or are both of them wrong?”</p>
<p>“The more you pray, the more you please Me. So your father is wrong. Again, when you pray, if your heart is not in your prayer, then you are simply wasting time. So your mother is wrong if she insists on your praying when you have no sincere feelings in your prayer. Let Me give you a new prayer. This prayer will give you everything you want:</p>
<p>‘God, I pray to You to make me Your sweetest and dearest child. I pray to You to make me as kind as You are. I pray to You to make me listen to You every day. I pray to You to make me think of You always. I pray to You to give me the capacity to please You every day, every hour, every minute and every second.”'</p>
<p>“God, it is a terrific prayer. Can I add a few words?”</p>
<p>“Certainly you can, by all means.”</p>
<p>“God, I wish to add this: ‘I love You, God. I worship You, God. I adore You, God.”'</p>
<p>“Amen. Wonderful, wonderful!”</p>
<p>“God, a million thanks. For sure I shall say every day the prayer that You have given me.”</p>

<p>“God, my grandfather always tells me that I must never tell a lie. But You know God, he has told me many lies.”</p>
<p>“What are the lies that he has told you?”</p>
<p>“Number one lie: He told me that You are much older than he is.</p>
<p>“Number two lie: You don’t need eyes to see like us.</p>
<p>“Number three lie: You don’t need ears to hear like us.</p>
<p>“Number four lie: You don’t need a mouth to talk.</p>
<p>You are right in front of me. I see that You have two eyes, two ears and a mouth like me, and also I see that You are very young and beautiful. You are not even as old as my father. How can my grandfather tell me that You are older than he is?”</p>
<p>“My child, you are right. Your grandfather is also right. His knowledge of Me is from the books. Your knowledge of Me is from seeing Me face to face. Your grandfather takes Me as an idea. You see Me as a real Man, a loving Friend, and a living Truth.”</p>

<p>“God I am a bit puzzled. My grandmother says that You are inside my heart. My mother says that You are inside my eyes. My father says that You are around me. Who is right, God?”</p>
<p>“All of them are right.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, God. How can everybody be right? Please tell me frankly, who is right?”</p>
<p>“I tell you frankly, My child, your grandmother is right, your mother is right, your father is right.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I live inside your heart. That is why you are so soulful. I live inside your eyes. That is why you look spiritually beautiful. I live around you. That is why you are always so careful.”</p>
<p>“God, You deserve my thanks.”</p>
<p>“I don’t deserve your thanks. It is your grandmother, your mother and your father who deserve your thanks. Go and thank them.”</p>
<p>“I will. God, before I leave You, I wish to tell You one thing. Since You have always been very kind to me, You deserve my special thanks. My grandmother, mother and father will get ordinary thanks from me.”</p>
<p>God smiles and cries with joy.</p>

<p>“God, I wish to tell You something. Two thousand five hundred years ago there lived on earth a very, very great spiritual Master. His name was Buddha. I do think that You have heard his name. My father is a spiritual man. He follows the Buddha’s path.”</p>
<p>“Ramana, please tell Me, which path does your mother follow?”</p>
<p>“God, my mother follows many paths. She follows Buddha’s path, Krishna’s path, Ramakrishna’s path, Ramana Maharshi’s path, and at times, she follows Sri Chinmoy’s path. By the way God, these are all good and great spiritual Masters. They have many, many disciples and followers. God, I am now in a serious difficulty. I do not know which path I should follow. If I follow my father’s path, the path of Zen, my father will be very pleased; and if I follow my mother’s path, that is to say, many paths all at once, I shall please my mother.”</p>
<p>“I wish you to follow My Path.”</p>
<p>“What is Your Path, God?”</p>
<p>“Every day pray and meditate; I shall soon let you know what My Path is.”</p>
<p>“God, I thank You from the bottom of my heart.”</p>
