<p>At four o'clock this morning we vagabonds went to run. We had planned to run fifteen miles, but in the end we had to be satisfied with seven.</p>
<p>Seven miles a day I ran for five days. Is it a joke? And Union Turnpike has hills!</p>
<p>I have maintained my weight at 138 pounds for so many days! Today I have come down to 136. I have a chart of good runners. Out of twelve runners, only one runner is fat. Eleven are thin.</p>

<p>Before the start of the Long Island Marathon, an old bald-headed man came up to me. He didn't fold his hands, but he was full of reverential awe. He said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said I was.</p>
<p>He said, "I am so happy and honoured to be here and speak to you. This is my first marathon."</p>
<p>So I congratulated him. He said, "I have run quite a few races of yours."</p>
<p>Then the funniest thing happened. After fourteen miles, I got the shock of my life. He was passing me coming from the other direction. I asked myself, "How could he be so far ahead of me if this is his first marathon?"</p>
<p>I waved to him. I usually don't wave to anybody, but he had been so nice to me. Later I realised that I was actually ahead of him. He finished far behind me.</p>

<p>Many runners greeted me during the Long Island Marathon. At least six or seven people recognised me and came up to me. One man was at least twenty metres ahead of me. All of a sudden he got the inspiration to stop. I said to myself, "Why did he stop?" He stopped only to shake hands with me.</p>

<p>At one point during the marathon I was walking for a few metres. There was one man who asked me if I was all right. He kept asking, "Are you really all right?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am all right."</p>
<p>Then he was telling the people who were helping me, "He is all right, don't worry."</p>
<p>Then I started running, but he was still walking.</p>

<p>Today, first I saw Nishtha the great, then Vidagdha the great. After I passed Vidagdha, I heard someone running towards me very fast. I said, "How can Vidagdha run so fast?" Then when I turned around, I saw it was Yasu.</p>
<p>After Yasu I saw Sundar. He was running so fast and making such noise with his legs; they were thundering!</p>

<p>At one point while I was running a young boy was behind me. All of a sudden he got inspired to go ahead of me. He crossed the street only to be stung by a bee or some insect near a tree. He started screaming and holding his right eye. When I passed by that tree, I was praying I wouldn't get stung, and I didn't.</p>

<p>Last night a little after twelve-thirty I went running. After five and a half miles or so, when I was on my way back, I saw a car that was making absolutely unthinkable, unbearable noises. Luckily, I was on the other side of the street, so I was quite safe. Then that same car went ahead, made a U-turn and came to my side. It was still making such noise! So I jumped onto the sidewalk, and continued running quite peacefully.</p>
<p>Suddenly the car stopped right alongside of me. It was a red car with a black hood. Two young girls were inside. One of them said, "Excuse me, excuse me, are you Sri Chinmoy? Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>She said, "We are so happy to see you. We saw you on television two days ago." They were so excited to see me at that hour. So I thanked them.</p>
<p>They were very, very nice girls, but what were they doing in that car at that hour?</p>

<p>I was out running at three-thirty this morning near the old Bohack Supermarket. Now it is a Sunset Electric store. There is a bar across the street. Outside the bar I saw eight or ten undivine people. I said, "O God, let me go another way." So I had to retrace my steps and take another street in order to avoid them.</p>
<p>Then I was near Divine Robe Supreme. I wanted to go to the playground, so I took a side street, again only to meet four or five undivine people — near Chidananda's house. They were very bad people. So I went back and started running on another road. After I got to the track there was no problem. Then I ran alone on the beautiful track.</p>
<p>While coming back near Annam Brahma, I saw somebody trying to start his motorbike. The noise was unbearable. His girlfriend didn't want to go with him on the motorbike. With one hand he was holding the bike and with the other hand he was holding her.</p>

<p>Karabi is wonderful. Yesterday she saw me while I was running, but I didn't see her. She was in her car, coming back from the Queens College track. She gave a full description of what I was wearing.</p>
<p>After running five miles I was returning, near Main Street. According to my standard, I was going fast. But a middle-aged lady said to her friend, "His nose is running faster than his legs!"</p>
<p>It was true that my nose was running.</p>
<p>So the other lady said, "Yes, you go and join him and try to run."</p>
<p>Inwardly I thanked the second lady.</p>
<p>In the morning what kind of appreciation I get! These people's souls want to talk to me.</p>

<p>This morning before the ten-mile race, I ran to the three-and-a-half-mile mark in Flushing Meadow Park, and then I ran home.</p>
<p>Yasu saw me, then Kalatit and then Edythe. She was in a car, driving to Flushing Meadow to set up. But once I got home I pretended that I had not yet run so I could surprise everyone later.</p>
<p>During the race I was afraid Yasu would say, "I saw you running this morning," but fortunately he didn't say anything, so I kept my secret.</p>
<p>I was running so slowly during the ten-mile race that I didn't feel tired at all, even after nine miles. Then I waved to Lavanya and Chetana, saying that I was going to go faster for the last mile.</p>
<p>So this morning altogether I ran seventeen miles.</p>
