<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to know that every day will not be the same. Some days are rainy; others are sunny. When the inner weather is bright and clear, naturally on that day we can get more inspiration. The soul's day is like that. But if we are not aware of it or if we are not paying attention to it, then it is like any other day. So we cannot categorically say that we will make the most progress on our birthday.</p>
<p>Some people feel miserable on their birthday because every moment they are occupied with earthly, mundane things. They feel miserable the whole day because early in the morning they could not meditate, during the day they could not meditate and in the evening they could not meditate. The birthday is the anniversary of the day the soul entered into the world, making a very special promise to the Supreme. Especially on our birthday, we have the golden opportunity to renew that promise and offer our surrender and gratitude to the Supreme. The opportunity is there; only we have to avail ourselves of it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best way is to repeat again and again: "I came into the world to love God, to serve God and to manifest God." If you can repeat this, you can make the best progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The power of a person's prayer depends on the consciousness of the individual. If the consciousness of the individual is high, then his prayer will be more potent. If his consciousness is not high, even if it is his birthday, then it will not be potent.</p>
<p>Some seekers are clever or wise. Over the years they have observed that they do not make any progress on their birthday; instead, they go downhill because often the hostile forces attack on that day. So five or six days before their birthday, they pray and meditate with utmost sincerity, love and devotion. In this way they accumulate inner wealth. Then, if the hostile forces attack them on their birthday and their consciousness descends, if they are not feeling spiritual at their birthday party, it is not so bad because they have already earned and received so much.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends entirely on your inner faith. If you meditate on my highest transcendental consciousness, you are bound to feel my spiritual presence. During your meditation, if you can feel that while I am in that consciousness I am all for you — for your spiritual success and progress — then your meditation will be extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Right now I am relaxed and answering questions, but you are trying to listen to me devotedly and you are seeing the spiritual inside the physical in me. Similarly, when I am physically absent and you are meditating on my transcendental picture, you have to feel the physical inside the spiritual. Then easily you can make progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on your connection with the person. If you sincerely feel an inner connection, then giving gifts helps them both inwardly and outwardly. But if you do not have any connection, if you give somebody a birthday gift just because that person gave you a gift on your birthday, then there is no feeling behind it and it is silly. But if you give something with utmost feeling, concern and loving oneness, then it does help.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Being peaceful is infinitely more important than buying prasad or going out to a restaurant with your friends. These things are not important. If you can get peace, joy and inner aspiration while you are eating Chinese food with your friends, that is all right. But if your inner poise, inner height and intense inner cry all disappear inside your Chinese food, then that is not good. If you only give yourself to outer, social activities and pay no attention to your spirituality, then you will lose all your inner wealth.</p>
<p>Again, you have to know that the inner and the outer both must go together. If you pray and meditate in the morning most soulfully and powerfully, definitely you will receive inner poise and other inner wealth. Then you have to maintain this inner poise while you are making prasad or doing other things during the day.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the soul takes incarnation, it does not care for winter or summer or spring. It is descending because somebody is begging for a soul and saying, "I am welcoming you. Be my guest. This is my home. This is my month." But from the highest Heaven, the soul is not thinking of spring or summer.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on how developed the soul is. Ordinary souls do not have that capacity. The most advanced souls may have a free access to quite a few planes of consciousness, but even these souls do not have access to all planes of consciousness or to God's infinite Wisdom-Light. If God, out of His infinite Bounty, wants to grant His infinite Wisdom-Light in a blessingful way to a particular realised soul, He can. Otherwise, no soul, no matter how highly developed it is, will be able to have God's Wisdom Light or free access to all the planes.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Access is not everything. You people come to see me when I am playing tennis. You have access to me, but that does not mean you have my wisdom-light. In the disciples' case, what is evolving? Your eagerness is evolving. Today you have a certain eagerness to please me, to become close to me, to get peace or light from me. As your eagerness increases, your receptivity increases and you are able to receive more inner qualities from me. On the strength of your eagerness, each time you are getting a little more, a little more. And as your inner wealth increases, your spiritual life or inner life evolves.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say that someone's soul comes to me, it does not mean that the soul has to come always in its own form. The soul can also take the form of your face or your body in the subtle physical world. Sometimes a person's soul comes to me just before I see that individual. First I see the soul, and then I see the person. Sometimes the soul comes to me in its own form, with boundless beauty that cannot be described. At other times, the soul can take the form of the individual's physical body.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, for example, I saw two disciples on 150th Street. Just a few seconds before that, I was talking to their souls. At that time, what I saw was not the soul in its pristine form. The souls had taken the form of the subtle physical.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Have you forgotten that you and I will die one day? Souls are all the time coming and going. It is like a shuttle. Tomorrow you are going to Boston and a few days later you will come back. Like this, the soul is taking incarnation and then, after playing its role successfully or unsuccessfully, it is going back. Then new souls are coming.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some spiritual Masters say that in the process of evolution — it may take thousands of years or God knows how long — souls will come down directly from the subtle physical and take human form without going through the birth process. "Superman" is the word Nietzsche used, but he used it in a vital sense, whereas Sri Aurobindo used it in a divine sense.</p>
<p>Now we are at the mercy of death. Death can take us away at any time; while we are drinking water or reading the newspaper, we can die. Only spiritual Masters and very highly developed souls can use their conscious will to determine the moment of their death. But in the future, when souls come down directly into the physical body while remaining fully conscious, they will not be under the jurisdiction of death. Souls will be able to stay on earth to work for God and manifest God's Will as long as they want to. Then they will have greater possibilities to manifest God because death will not be able to take them away prematurely.</p>
<p>At that time, the body itself will be part and parcel of the soul's divinity. Now the body is lethargic and undivine. It does not listen even to the heart, let alone the soul, which is infinitely higher. Now we do not know where God is or even where our soul is. Sometimes we are aware of the heart, but we do not listen to it. But the day will come when the body, vital, mind and heart will be perfect instruments of God. At that time these members will be so spiritually developed that they will immediately understand whatever it is that God does.</p>
<p>Now we do not understand anything about God's Vision. It is just a matter of belief or feeling or blind faith that God is doing everything for our own good. Now it is not necessary for us to understand Him, because we love Him and have faith in Him. But a day will come when He will be able to make us immediately see and feel why He is asking us to do something. At that time the mind will not operate at all.</p>
<p>Now when God asks us to do something, the heart may be ready to listen, but the mind hesitates. Again, the mind is afraid that if the heart, vital and body all listen to God and the mind remains the only obstacle, then the mind will be in serious trouble. So right now the mind obeys God unwillingly. But a day will come when the mind will immediately be convinced, just like the heart, that God is telling us to do the right thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In life we always observe special dates. Otherwise, life is monotonous. Every day we eat, but the day we go to a restaurant and eat special food, we remember. Every day the soul is observing our body, vital, mind and heart. But on our birthday, the soul renews its promise to God, and the members of its family — the heart, mind, vital and body — also renew their promise to God. The soul has made conscious promises to God, and the members of its family have made unconscious promises. But there is only one promise that they all make: God-fulfilment — God-fulfilment in the body, in the vital, in the mind, in the heart and in the entire being.</p>
<p>For great seekers, every day the soul comes to the fore and helps them considerably. But if someone is not a conscious seeker, the soul does not try to come forward; it feels it is a hopeless case. If the doctor knows that somebody is practically dead, then what is the use of giving him an injection? But if he sees that there is still some life, then he will try. In the case of ordinary human beings, even on their birthdays the soul does not come forward because the individuals are not consciously aspiring.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Since there is no earth-bound time in Heaven, how does the soul know on what day to incarnate so as to be in accord with astrology? Does the Supreme say, Wait, you have to go down on such and such a day because of astrology?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Since there is no earth-bound time in Heaven, how does the soul know on what day to incarnate so as to be in accord with astrology? Does the Supreme say, Wait, you have to go down on such and such a day because of astrology?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme does not deal with astrology at all. The soul is not going to think of the time and date it should come down, and who is going to watch. The soul is the boss. Whenever the boss wants to come down to the factory floor, he comes. Then the workers see whether it is three o'clock or five o'clock and what position the zodiac is in.</p>
<p>When taking incarnation, the soul never thinks of astrology — far from it! The soul will have an interview with the Supreme and then it is done. It is not like when you go to the bank, and others in the street will see that you have taken a cab and that you are looking at this person or that person. They will say, "Yes, he was there, he looked around, he went to that teller and so forth." The soul is not paying any attention to these things.</p>
