Why?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to me, this will be the order: religious, political, social and economic. Why? If people are religious, they will try to lead a better life, a purer life. What the world needs most is a better life and a purer life. Next is political. Politics governs the mind, the vital and the body of mankind. As religion mainly deals with the heart and inner feelings, even so politics deals mostly with the mind — the organising mind, the energising vital and the alert body. Then comes the social. After religion has touched the heart and politics has touched the mind, the vital and the body, then there should be amity and friendship in the society. At this time the individual is becoming collective. After an individual becomes religious and offers light to mankind, then he has to establish his friendship, his social qualities. At that time economic problems will be solved easily.</p>
<p>So first we think of God and offer light to our nation, our country. Then we want to become closely connected with others. When we want to become closely connected with others, then economic problems will be solved considerably. For then my need you will feel as your need and your need I will feel as my need. At that time I shall be more than ready to help you and you will be more than happy to help me. But if we don't feel our oneness, then we shall not feel each other's needs. So first religion, then politics, then social problems and then economics.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both are equally important. If East and West are not united, if they do not see eye to eye with each other, then there will be a disaster not only on the mental plane but also on the vital plane and the physical plane. So political relations between East and West are of paramount importance. Again, of equal importance are the economic relations between North and South. If North and South do not share their economic achievements, then there will also be a terrible disaster on the mental plane, the vital plane and the physical plane.</p>
<p>In both cases, between East and West and between North and South, what we need is a feeling of sympathetic concern, love and oneness. Between East and West the political reality is of paramount importance. Between North and South the economic reality is of paramount importance. The political reality of one hemisphere should not try to dominate the political reality of another hemisphere. Again, the poverty-stricken countries and the rich countries have to realise that they can have satisfaction only when the rich offer their wealth to the poor and when the poor accept this wealth with gratitude and not with a demanding attitude.</p>

To refuse any contact or compromise in the hope of their evolution?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A world-disciple will never compromise. His is the life that will soulfully and dauntlessly fight dictatorship, imposed will and the restriction of individual rights and liberties. Compromise can never be the answer. When we make a compromise with darkness and ignorance, then it is half and half: ignorance gives half and light gives half. But the half that ignorance keeps is destructive, so ignorance has to be totally transformed. The entire ignorance has to come and take shelter in light. So there can be no compromise between truth and falsehood. If there is a compromise between the two, then falsehood will rule half the world.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as compromise in the inner life — either God or Satan, either ignorance or light, either day or night. If you compromise with darkness and hope that eventually darkness will change into light in the process of evolution, then I wish to say that this is a false hope. Night will not change, darkness will not change. It is the light that has to operate consciously in and through night. Otherwise, night, as such, on its own will never give way to light. It is the power of light that will have to compel the night to surrender for its own good.</p>

If so, of what use would be the existence of such a closed circuit?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary to change the Member States in order to change the United Nations organisation. One may call the Member States a closed circuit and, from a particular point of view, one may be justified in saying so. But from a different angle if we see the situation, then we can say that when there is a large body or organisation, within the large body there has to be a smaller body to organise the thing. If all the countries were equal, and everybody held the same status, then there would be no organisation. When there is a school, there is one teacher and many students. It is not a hierarchy in an authoritarian sense; only it is a necessity. If we build a house, then we need an engineer and an architect, and also a few workers. If everybody does the job of the architect, then there will be no workers to build the house.</p>
<p>In such a big organisation as the United Nations, some countries have to shoulder more responsibility than other countries, so naturally they will have more voice. If everybody became the king, then there would be no subjects. Here I am not saying that some Member States are kings; only some should come forward to show light to others. If everybody had light, then everyone would be in Heaven. At that time earth would be Heaven itself. But this is not the case. Again, all the countries should be more sympathetic and develop greater oneness. Then it would be an ideal situation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I fully agree. The world-disciple must needs help bring the nations' souls to the fore. When the soul comes to the fore with its inner effulgence, divine effulgence, then it is only a matter of time before the mind, vital and body accept it. The aspiring heart immediately accepts it, but the other members may take some time. But we have to come without from within. We sow the seed underground and then it germinates. It becomes a sapling, a plant and finally a giant banyan tree. So from within the reality must come forward, and it is the soul that embodies the reality and the divinity within.</p>

Should it not be the main quality to be fostered and pointed out to mankind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are absolutely right. Good will is love in action and it has to be fostered and pointed out to mankind. But in order to point it out to mankind and foster it, we have to know where good will comes from. Does it come from the physical mind? No. Does it come from the dynamic vital? No. Does it come from the alert body? No. Good will comes only from the crying heart, the heart that cries to see its Beloved Supreme in itself and in all other hearts. So the source of good will is man's aspiring heart. This good will that comes from the aspiring heart is undoubtedly love in action. And without fail it has to be fostered and pointed out to mankind in order to accelerate humanity's progress.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I see that the United Nations organisation has a definite role in enlightening the life of mankind. But it is not the outer music that will do the needful. Only it is the inner music, the music of the heart, that continuously feels and makes others feel that we are of the One and for the many. The many are our extended and expanded reality.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable for one country to have one vote. But this vote has to come from the general mass. It is not an individual will that is being executed. Otherwise, it will be like many minds going in many ways. At that time nothing will be settled and there will be no hope of reaching any conclusion. So the unity of the collective reality will have to voice forth, and then there will be one vote, one will, one reality — one illumining and one fulfilling choice.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The heart centre need not be an individual; it need not he the Security Council or the Secretary-General or the Economic and Social Council. These are all realities, but these realities need not remain as separate entities. They can be combined together or at least the essence and qualities of each of these realities can be unified. Then, when they are unified, there will be a feeling of oneness, and this feeling of oneness is nothing short of the heart centre.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is hard to say who is fully committed spiritually and who is not fully committed spiritually.

True spirituality means the acceptance of life as such. Here we have to know that this life which we accept is composed of spirit and matter. So if one embodies the spirit and wants to make the spiritual reality operate in and through the material proper, then one is undoubtedly spiritual. In the case of Dag Hammarskjold, we saw his inner light inundate his mind. Then from the mind, from the illumined mind, he executed the will of the heart, combining the illumining realities of the vital and the sacrificing realities of the physical. In the case of U Thant, who was a staunch and devout Buddhist, we saw that he brought to the fore the compassion-aspect of life, which is the purest jewel-reality in the human existence. He offered this compassion-reality to mankind unreservedly, almost unconditionally.</p>
<p>Sometimes the word "spiritual" is misunderstood badly. A spiritual person becomes an object of ridicule to the cynical human beings. Sometimes the non-believers, if not disbelievers, in God the Source of the Oneness-Creation, look down upon those who are spiritual. But those who inwardly see the inseparable oneness of God the Creator and God the Creation try to offer this realisation to the world at large. In spite of being misunderstood, in spite of being assailed by physical ailments, as in the case of U Thant, in silence they act. And they leave the result at the Feet of God, the Author of all Good. I wish to tell you that the twentieth century has already been blessed with two spiritual giants: Dag Hammarskjold and U Thant. Secretary-General U Thant and Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold are two most outstanding examples of spiritual persons. Outwardly they may not be recognised as spiritual figures. But being a spiritual man, I have established my own oneness with them — with their achievement, with their tremendous sacrifice, with their inner cry — and I wish to say that they were undoubtedly spiritual persons committed to spiritual realities which are not easy for the doubtful, sophisticated mind and analytical intellect to comprehend.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that wars begin in the minds of men. If the mind changes, then there will be no war. But how will the mind change? The mind will change only when it is transformed. There is only one way to transform the mind and that is to bring the reality, the divinity, of the heart to the fore. The mind of humanity is changing, but it is going at the speed of an Indian bullock cart. At any moment the storm of doubt and the hurricane of jealousy can stop humanity's mind from proceeding farther. But if the heart qualities come forward and illumine the mind, then there can be no doubt-storm or jealousy-hurricane. An illumined mind founded upon the loving heart can not only put an end to war, but also expedite world-oneness, world-perfection and world-satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Nuclear arms and nuclear energy are very dangerous tools. What is your attitude toward both?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Nuclear arms and nuclear energy are very dangerous tools. What is your attitude toward both?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, we do admit that nuclear arms and nuclear energy are very dangerous tools. Right now they are used for a destructive purpose, especially nuclear arms. But who is their creator? Their creator is a human being. A human being is the creator of nuclear arms and nuclear energy. But we have to know that the human creator is also a creation of a Supreme Creator. In a fraction of a second the Supreme Creator can change the destructive mind of an individual human being into a loving mind, a universal mind. It is the operation of the mind that either maintains mankind or destroys mankind. If the Supreme Force wants to operate in humanity's mind, then the dangerous things and dangerous achievements on earth need not and cannot remain dangerous. For there is something which is infinitely more powerful than the dangerous tools created by mankind, and this supremely powerful thing is God's Compassion for His children. When God uses His supreme weapon, Compassion, no human tool — no matter how dangerous — can face it. God's Compassion and God the Compassion are always for mankind. First God sends His representative, which is Compassion. Then, if He sees that His representative is not strong enough to solve the problem, at that time He Himself comes as God the Compassion. But in most of the cases, God's Compassion-Power is more than enough to save the world from imminent crises.</p>
