<p>I was walking around Jamaica High School. All of a sudden, out of the blue, a soul came to me for blessings. I blessed the soul so happily. Then I said, “Today I am going to invite him to my place to eat.”</p>
<p>Not even three seconds later, a runner came around the corner near Thomas Edison High School and ran towards me. The distance was about 200 metres, but I saw immediately that it was the same person: Aviram.</p>
<p>This is an all-German day. Before that, when I was making a right turn, I saw a German lady, Rose.</p>

<p>I always say that if someone’s soul comes to me, I invariably see the person a few seconds later. This time it was at least seven minutes. The incident happened three days ago, early in the morning.</p>
<p>At least seven minutes before I saw her, Vijaya’s soul came to me and I blessed her. It was at my 1500-metre mark. Then when I had gone another 800 metres, I saw Vijaya running. I said, “I never thought she would run at this hour by herself.” On other days, I have seen Nilima with her. But on that day she was alone.</p>
<p>No matter which way I go, Sulochana is available, either here or there. Usually, I do not draw attention from people. But in her case, she runs looking down. So I have to scream and draw her attention. She is in another world.</p>

<p>An elderly man who is very tall often sees me at my 800-metre mark. He is usually accompanied by his small dog. Whenever this gentleman sees me, he has to greet me. A few days ago, he said with such sympathy, “When are you going to start running again?”</p>
<p>I was walking, but for years and years he has seen me running. He was not joking. He feels genuinely sad that I cannot run. So I gave him a very grateful smile.</p>

<p>I was at my 1400-metre mark. Dipali’s soul came to me. Her soul was telling me, warning me, that she has to reduce her mileage and also be more careful with regard to her running — careful is the right word.</p>
<p>I said, “All right, I shall tell her.” My eyes were half-closed. Then, three or four seconds later, I saw one girl with folded hands. I was on the pavement walking and she was in the street. I said, “Who is this?” I opened my eyes wide and I saw Dipali. First I saw Dipali and then I saw Snigdha. Snigdha and I greeted each other.</p>
<p>Every day I take an oath that I will not look at anybody; I will only remain in my highest meditation. Then, as soon as I go out, I see someone this side and someone else that side. They are expecting my greetings.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Hawaii anecdotes</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Hawaii anecdotes" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At 1:30 a.m. on the first day in Hawaii, I went out walking in Honolulu. A young man came up to me. He said, “Sir, Sir, what are you doing at this hour?” He wanted to know why I was moving around at this ungodly hour. I was meditating, so I just smiled at him. Then he continued, “It is not safe.” Again I smiled at him. Once more he said, “This is not safe. Please!” He was worried about me.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The second day I went out a little after two o’clock in the morning. I was walking and meditating as usual. Ahead of me I saw a tall man who was drinking. I passed by him and did not pay any attention to him. Then he came chasing me. He said, “Why are you afraid of me? Why are you running away? I am only drinking Diet Coke.” Then he showed me his paper cup. He said, “You do not have to be afraid of me. I am not drinking liquor. I am taking Diet Coke.”</p>
<p>I was walking fast, but he thought that I was afraid of him. This is how people catch me when I go out early in the morning.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The third day I went out at 1:30 a.m. One man came up to me and said, “Can you tell me the time?”</p>
<p>I replied, “It is a quarter to two.” He went on his way and then, a few minutes later, he came back.</p>
<p>“How do you know?” he asked.</p>
<p>I said, “I know that I came out of my apartment at 1:30. Now I have walked for fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>Then the man took his watch out of his pocket and checked the time. He said, “Right!”</p>
<p>If he had a watch, why did he challenge me? But he did not want to take the trouble to look at it.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Every morning some experience I get when I walk. For three mornings I saw Vijali’s soul eight or ten metres ahead of me. Three days her soul was there facing me and each day I blessed her. Many years ago, when I used to walk along the canal at four or five o’clock in the morning, she used to be there.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went out at 12:45 a.m. I was having a very high meditation while I was walking. All of a sudden I saw the soul of an ex-disciple. The soul was asking for a blessing. I blessed the soul and went on my way. After some time an idea came to me: perhaps it is this person’s birthday. Later that day I asked somebody to check and it was true. Then I discovered that it was also Rijuta’s birthday. Rijuta’s soul did not come at that time. After four or five hours, her soul came.</p>

<p>This morning at 7:35 I went out for a walk. When I was coming back, I was reaching my 1200-metre mark when I saw one girl running towards me very fast. She was running at least a seven-minute pace and taking long strides. I saw that we were almost going to have a collision. So I stopped and waved at her. Then I moved my left shoulder away from her path. My left shoulder escaped by an inch or two. She acted as if she did not see me, but I knew that she was only showing off. She ran on and did not stop.</p>
<p>When I was on 150th Street, I saw another disciple on my side of the pavement coming towards me. She immediately stopped and entered into the street with folded hands to allow me to pass.</p>
<p>Then, when I was very near my house, I saw a third one. It was Dipali. She stopped and put her hands on her heart chakra.</p>

<p>One fellow was dancing and jumping at the finish line. Another man was running back and forth at the end.</p>

<p>I do not have speed, I do not have stamina, I do not have the determination to run, but I do have the eagerness to watch the marathon. I like it so much. Everybody is like a beautiful flower. While they are crying, we smile. While they are smiling, we cry. If somebody is crying, in order to cheer the person, we smile. If they are smiling, we say, “We know that you are crying inside.” We identify with their smiles and with their tears.</p>
