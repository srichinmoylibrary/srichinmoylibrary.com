<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Supreme felt extremely proud of John Adams at that time, for John Adams triumphantly transcended the barriers of nationalism and entered into the free world of internationalism. In this world, the individual has to be given a full chance to defend himself and fulfil himself according to the light that he embodies.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People usually break the law because they don't want to be under any law. This is the outer reason. The inner reason is that, after all, it is not they who have made the laws. If they had made the laws, they would have defended these laws like anything. Again, there are spiritual people who break man-made laws because they have received a higher message. From the spiritual point of view, by listening to a higher law, they are doing what they are supposed to do in the world of aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On the one hand, each person has his own way of seeing the truth, feeling the truth and becoming the truth. There are many minds, many ways, and there is no basic oneness. On the other hand, two heads are better than one. So the jury system gives us the opportunity to combine the wisdom of many, to unite the wisdom of many, instead of singing the song of separativity and individual supremacy. If the members of the jury believe, as they should, in combining their respective wisdom, then naturally the jury system is an asset.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In general, it is good and important to obey all the laws of the country in which we live, including traffic laws. If we do not obey traffic laws, then eventually either we will send someone to God or someone will send us to God. At that time, the poor medical world will not be able to show us its medicine-power.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not know which law is important and which is not important. Such being the case, it is good to consider all the laws important unless some laws are obviously ridiculous and stupid.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are certain simple spiritual guidelines that can help an average lawyer or lawmaker. He should try to be as sincere and as simple as possible and he should try to bring to the fore the loving heart rather than the demanding vital. Our point of view may be no better than others' point of view. If that is the case, then a heart of compromise is undoubtedly the best spiritual guideline.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Lawyers can become spiritual, more spiritual, most spiritual, provided they can soulfully feel that God Himself is the law, God himself is the lawgiver, God Himself is the verdict and God experiences Himself in and through the different realities in life. Each experience is a fulfilling and illumining lesson for Mother Earth.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The laws that limit and stifle the possibilities of certain people are undoubtedly not God-made laws. These laws do not come from a higher source. These laws are made by people who want to maintain their supremacy and violently prevent others from running abreast with them. All should be given the same chance; each individual should be allowed to shine according to his merit, his inner receptivity and his outer capacity. In a race, all the runners start from the same starting point. Then we notice that some are superior runners, while others are not. But if we do not give everyone the same chance, if everyone does not start from the same spot, then how are we going to know who is the champion? An equal chance must be given to all and sundry, and then the Divine in us will see who wins.</p>
<p>Life is nothing but a game. From the spiritual point of view, the loser and the winner can have true joy and satisfaction only by placing the result-experiences, whether they come in the form of victory or defeat, with equal joy at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>
