<p>The day before yesterday, in the evening, I was running on 150th Street, near the bus stop. An old lady affectionately said to me, "Stop, stop!" so I stopped. Then, with such affection she said, "My son, my son, cold, cold, cold!" She had on a heavy winter coat and fur hat. I gave her a very broad smile and continued running.</p>

<p>I was running around four-thirty in the morning when I saw a tall, thin black man was running ahead of me. When he saw a garbage can, he went over to it, removed the cover and threw it onto the owner's lawn. Then he went on to the next one. After he did this to four houses I said, "O God, I am not going to run with him," and I went in another direction.</p>

<p>When I was running on the Grand Central service road near Jamaica High School, a taxi driver very pathetically asked me how to find Atlantic Avenue.</p>
<p>I am the one who never knows anything about giving directions. I said to myself, "O God, save me, save me!" Then I said to the taxi driver, "Make a right turn and go to Jamaica Avenue, and then ask people there how to go to Atlantic Avenue."</p>
<p>The driver said, "I see the Van Wyck Expressway and Atlantic Avenue when I come from Kennedy Airport."</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, you have to make a right turn."</p>
<p>I was so proud of myself that I was able to give him the correct information.</p>

<p>About a week ago I was running near the Jamaica High School track. Some mischievous boys on their way to Thomas Edison Vocational and Technical High School called out with tremendous mockery, "There he goes: the great spiritual Master!" It was not with any kind of good feeling that they were saying this.</p>

<p>Today one of the disciples was telling me that he met a very good runner while running in Flushing Meadow Park. This man had told the disciple that he often sees me running and that he thought I was a sub-three-hour marathoner because I was so thin and I looked like I was in such good shape. The disciple was very polite and told the runner that I was hoping to break three and a half hours in the New York Marathon. He didn't tell him my previous bullock-cart marathon times.</p>

<p>That afternoon I went shopping to bring back some food for the disciples. When I entered into the bus, the driver said to me, "Why didn't you run this morning? What were you doing?"</p>
<p>He was a very nice, bearded black man. I said, "Are you talking to me?"</p>
<p>The driver said, "Yes. Every day I see you running before five o'clock in the morning. I see you at least two or three times every day, but I have not seen you for a couple of days. What is wrong with you?"</p>
<p>I explained, "I am relaxing before the New York Marathon."</p>
<p>He said, "Good luck! I see you don't give a damn about cold or rain. People enter into my bus cold and frozen and I save them, but I see you running in such cold. For the last couple of days I have not seen you."</p>
<p>I said, "This is on my route, but recently I have been running very few miles."</p>
<p>When I was leaving the bus he said, "Lots of luck to you."</p>

<p>I was about to cross the street when a small school bus stopped in the middle of the street. One of the disciples saw me waiting there and came running to carry my bags. Then I saw a thin man take off his hat and bow down. This kind of thing only the Harry who works at P.S. 86 used to do. When I came nearer I saw that it was Harry, so I also bowed down.</p>

<p>Quite often I see the two soldiers, H. and T., running along the street. As soon as H. sees me, even at a distance, he puts his right hand on his heart. T. either folds his hands or gives me a smile. H. smiles through his eyes and T. smiles through his teeth.</p>
<p>Today I was returning home after running only one mile. When I had only five hundred metres left, I saw someone running very fast on the other side of the street. In silence I said to him, "I am not envying you. Go ahead." I looked carefully and saw it was T. But this time he didn't greet me. I thought, "Had it been H., he would have greeted me."</p>
<p>As usual I was going very slowly, at my Indian bullock cart speed, so T. passed me and continued on his way. When I finished, I saw somebody practically hiding at the foot of a tree across the street. He gave me the biggest smile and folded his hands. I said, "My prayer has been sanctioned." It was T.</p>

<p>While I was in Japan, I was running in a park. At one point I saw ten or twelve American boys about to run short distances. The coach, a Japanese, said to me, "Come along. Run with us."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I can't run with you. You will run fast. I am running long-distance."</p>
<p>So I watched them. They were starting with one hundred or two hundred metre dashes. It was their morning run. Every day they run and many people in the park watch them. Their strides are quite good.</p>

<p>That morning I ran about six miles. During the run at least twenty other runners I encountered along the way bowed to me in the traditional Japanese manner. Ten or twelve times I also bowed to them. But after that it was too much for me. When they bowed I would just raise my hand to salute them.</p>
<p>Then, when I was really tired, I saw an old lady about sixty years old running. She bowed down, and in her case I felt that I had to bow down also.</p>
