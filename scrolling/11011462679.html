<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Tension is in the mind, nowhere else. Inside the heart there is no tension. Even inside the knees or legs there is no tension; there is only pain. Real tension is inside the mind.</p>
<p>Tension goes away to a great extent if you can breathe in and out very slowly. If you can imagine that you are taking one full minute to breathe in and another full minute to breathe out, even though in reality it may not be true that you are taking that long, then your tension is bound to be released.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Somebody went to a doctor and asked how to lose weight. The doctor said, "Eat as much as you can for as long as you can."</p>
<p>The person said, "Then how am I going to lose weight?"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "If you eat too much, then you are not going to get up. You will just lie in bed all the time. Then you won't go to work and your boss will fire you. If your boss fires you, you will have no money to buy food. Then automatically you will lose weight!"</p>
<p>To lose weight, do not have a long-range goal. Say you have to lose forty pounds. Never think of forty pounds. Only think of five pounds as your goal. You cannot climb up the Himalayas overnight.</p>

Your spiritual life is your main role. Your role is to love and serve God in God's own Way. So the day you accepted the spiritual life, your spiritual role started.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I know that in your case you work for twelve or fifteen hours every day. You want to minimise your working time because you have other, more important things to do than to be in your office or your studio all the time.</p>
<p>On the practical plane you have to get more workers who will be efficient in running your business. You have to train some people to such an extent that your physical presence is not needed. You not only have to train them, but you also have to have confidence in them. If they make mistakes, you have to forgive them and sympathise with them. If they do something wrong, you have to say, "Perhaps I would also have made that mistake had I been in their place." You have to train them with utmost concern and utmost compassion. If you train these people and show them utmost concern and compassion, and if you have oneness with them, you will easily be able to minimise your working time so that you can do more important things. Meanwhile, those whom you have trained will be able to do the work without your physical presence because they will have your inner guidance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will you speak about gratitude?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will you speak about gratitude?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In addition to our bad qualities, each human being has many, many good qualities. The most important and most significant good quality in our human life is gratitude. Unfortunately, that good quality we somehow manage not to express either in our thoughts or in our actions. Right from the beginning of our life we have somehow learned not to express it. So we have the least amount of the very thing that we need most in order to become a better person.</p>
<p>The things that most deserve our gratitude we just take for granted. Without air we cannot live for more than a minute or two. Every day we are breathing in and breathing out, but do we ever feel grateful to the air? If we do not drink water, we cannot survive. Even our body is composed to a large extent of water. But do we give any value to water? Every morning when we open our eyes, we see the sun blessingfully offering us light and life-energy, which we badly need. But are we grateful to the sun? On the contrary, when the sun is too bright we get mad and complain that it is bothering us. The sun is like the mother who gives food to the child so that he can remain alive on earth. But the child quite often gets annoyed at the mother for bothering him. In India we have many gods and goddesses, and even a particular god to whom we offer gratitude. The Western world has many saints. But do we offer these gods or these saints our gratitude?</p>
<p>Every day there are so many people to whom we should offer gratitude. Someone did me this favour. Someone else did me that favour. There is no end to the number of individuals to whom we have to offer our gratitude. If we try to offer gratitude to each individual, it becomes impossible. But no individual created himself. We were all created by God, our Heavenly Father. He is our Source. So if we are not able to offer gratitude to everyone who deserves it from us, we can at least offer gratitude to the Source.</p>
<p>A tree has many branches and countless leaves, flowers and fruits. If we try to offer our gratitude to the millions of leaves, people will say, "You are a fool!" We will get tired just counting the branches, not to speak of the leaves, flowers and fruits. But the tree came from a tiny seed, and the Source of that seed is God. He is the Source of everything in the creation. So if we offer our gratitude to the Source, we are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>From our early morning prayer and meditation we receive good thoughts. Some people will have hundreds of good thoughts. For them to try to offer gratitude to each thought would be ridiculous because they have to go to work, they have to do this, they have to do that. We know that if we can offer gratitude to anything good that comes to us early in the morning, then many good things will happen in our life. We will do good things for others and they will do good things for us. So how can we offer gratitude to our good thoughts? It is by offering gratitude to their Source, our Heavenly Father, for He is the One who has come to us in the form of good thoughts. Everything that comes to us in the form of goodness comes from God.</p>
<p>So at every moment we have to offer our sincere gratitude to the Source, because we will not be able to offer gratitude to each individual, each thought, each action. Today I have received a fax from Tomsk, Russia, informing me that they plan to teach my philosophy at the university there. God alone knows who the President of the university is, who the faculty members are who are responsible, who the secretary is who typed the fax. If I try to imagine what each of them looks like and then offer my gratitude, it will be a joke. But He who blessingfully inspired these people — the President, the faculty members, the university and the country — is the One to whom I can easily offer my soulful gratitude. As soon as I read the fax this morning, I offered gratitude to my Inner Pilot Supreme. Then, while I was reading out the fax to all of you, again I offered my gratitude to Him.</p>
<p>Of course, if we do have the opportunity to offer gratitude to a particular individual, wonderful! But even then what we are really doing is offering gratitude to the Source. Let us say that you do me a favour and I offer you my gratitude. At that time I am actually offering my gratitude to the Inner Pilot, the Source, in you — to the Heavenly Father, who is in you, in me, in the entire creation. The One who deserves my gratitude is not you, but God, our Heavenly Father. He is the very Person who came to you in the form of a good action, and He is the One who is inspiring me to offer you my gratitude. In everything He is the Doer; we are only His instruments.</p>
<p>Outwardly we should try to offer as much gratitude as we can to those who are inwardly or outwardly helping us. I am not saying that we should not offer gratitude to someone if he does something good for us. Far from it! But if we do not have the time to offer our gratitude to everyone who does something for us, God will not blame us. If we cannot offer gratitude to someone individually, no harm. But we have to offer gratitude to the One who has inspired the creation in the form of this human being. To Him we have to offer gratitude. We may not have time to offer our gratitude to the entire creation, but we do have time to offer gratitude to God inside us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak about growth, peace, luck and fulfilment?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak about growth, peace, luck and fulfilment?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Another word for growth is progress. Something that is growing is making progress. In our spiritual life, we say that the most important thing is not success but progress. Anything that comes to us in life in the form of success will eventually give us dissatisfaction, because the glory and joy of success does not last. Our success lasts for five minutes; then immediately somebody is there to smash our pride. That is because success-life and rivalry or competition always go together. No matter how successful we are today, there will always be somebody to defeat us tomorrow. Success makes us feel that we have become something, but this thing we cannot keep. And when it goes away, it is very painful.</p>
<p>But if we care only for progress, then we are not competing with anybody. Yesterday, let us say, I wrote two nice poems, and today I have written four poems. So I am very happy because I am making progress. I am not competing with you; I am not asking you how many poems you have written. But if I feel a sense of rivalry with you and ask you how many poems you have written, and if you say, "Oh, I wrote ten poems," then all my joy goes away and I feel miserable. So all that matters in our spiritual life is progress. That is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The next idea you asked about is peace. Peace we do not get by having something; peace we get only by becoming something. You have a farm and so many possessions, whereas a poor man may have nothing. So people may say that you have peace whereas the poor man has no peace, since early in the morning he has to think of where he is going to get food for the day. But you have other problems. Your problem may not be to get a little bread and butter, but you have to think of your wife, your children, your dear ones. They may get sick or something else may happen. Although you may have many possessions, at every moment they may cause you worry and anxiety. You know in your heart of hearts how much suffering you go through. So where is your peace?</p>
<p>What you have to do is consciously feel that you are not the owner of your possessions. Somebody has given them to you to take care of, and that Somebody may also take them back. Since You are not the owner but only the keeper, you will not be upset if He asks for them back. If you can feel that God has entrusted you with some prosperity and that you are keeping it for Him, if you can feel that you are not the possessor but only the keeper, then you will have peace. If you can feel that you are only consciously and soulfully executing His Will according to your capacity, then you will definitely have peace.</p>
<p>When we feel that we are taking care of something for someone, we feel that we are an extension of that person. Peace comes when we extend ourselves. I was born in a tiny village in India. That was my whole world. Then I went to a spiritual community and my world got bigger. Then I came to New York, the capital of the world, and my world became even larger. Now I am travelling in the Philippines, here, there, everywhere, and establishing my prayerful oneness with all of these places. So in the beginning I was only part of a tiny village, but now my soul-bird is flying the length and breadth of the world. The life-tree is one, but it has many, many branches. Each country is like a branch, an extension of the life-tree, and the bird is flying from this branch to the next. In this way I am expanding myself and becoming one with the whole world. When I am one with the whole world, who is there to take away my peace? At that time I have become peace itself.</p>
<p>You have asked about luck. There is no such thing as luck or fortune. Whenever there is luck, we have to know that in the inner world something has taken place. Luck comes in the form of the sea or the ocean, but a long stream or a long river has brought us to the ocean. When we reach the ocean, we feel that we are lucky, but we do not see that the life-river which carried us there is very, very long.</p>
<p>Everything comes from the inner world because of something we did either in this incarnation or in some previous incarnation, either twenty years ago or two hundred years ago. We believe in reincarnation. We feel that this is not our first or our last incarnation. If we want to please God and fulfil God, we need more than a single lifetime. Thousands and thousands of years are needed to do God's work properly. So what someone may call luck is actually the result of something good we have done.</p>
<p>Luck may also come from the good thoughts and good wishes of your friends and dear ones. You have so many friends. You cannot think of them all at the same time, but they all can easily think of you at the same time. If ten of your friends or dear ones are thinking of you with very pure, divine thoughts and offering you their love, affection and compassion, a solid inner power is being accumulated. It may seem that all of a sudden you are lucky. But you have no idea how many people have sent you goodwill at that very moment. You are getting the result, but you do not know the source. Again, the reason they are thinking of you with such goodwill is because you did them a favour either yesterday or many years ago. So luck is the result of something you have done in a previous incarnation or the accumulated result of things that you or your dear ones have done in this incarnation.</p>
<p>The last thing you asked about is fulfilment. We have to take fulfilment as happiness; there is no other way to think of it. Ordinary human happiness comes only when we get something that we wanted, when we are pleased in our own way. Let us say you want to be a very strong person. So you become strong and you are happy. But then you see that others are making fun of you because they are stronger. Or you see that although your body is strong today, it becomes weak tomorrow. This moment it has no ailments; the next moment it catches cold or gets a stomach upset. Then you cannot get up in the morning; you cannot talk to people. You are miserable. So for one moment this body gives you joy, and then for weeks or months it makes you miserable. This is the way everything happens in our life: we get something and then it is taken away. We get it for five seconds; then for five days or five months it is gone. When we get what we want, we are happy, and our happiness lasts for a fleeting second. When what we wanted is gone, we are miserable for a long time.</p>
<p>But there is another way of getting happiness — the way of surrender. The most powerful prayer in God's entire creation was uttered by the Saviour Christ: "Let Thy Will be done." There cannot be any prayer higher than this. He said, and everywhere on earth people have come to realise, that only by pleasing God in God's own Way can we be happy. Otherwise, we will keep the bird inside the cage for a few minutes, and then the bird will fly away. So if we want happiness, we have to change our attitude. We have to say, "It is God who brought the bird and gave me the inspiration and capacity to put it in the cage. And it was God who took the bird away from me." At every moment let us think of the Source — that God gave us something and that God took it away.</p>
<p>When our dear ones leave us, we have to feel that He who created them and who loves them infinitely more than we do, did what is best for them. Then we are happy. God's Love for His creation is infinitely greater than our love. God's Love for our dear ones is infinitely greater than our love for them. The potter has created a vessel with inspiration, affection and love. When we see the pot, we just grab it and break it. But he who created this vessel with such concern, such affection and such self-giving will never act like this.</p>
<p>God gave you [referring to Elias T.] your wife twenty-eight years ago out of His boundless Compassion. She existed before she married you, and now also she exists in the soul's world; she is in Heaven. It is as though while walking somebody comes and joins me for twenty-eight miles. After that, I become tired or the other person starts going faster. If I love that person, I will say, "You go according to your own speed. I am tired now; I have to take a little rest. Then, when my time comes, again I will run fast." So happiness comes by allowing the other person to go ahead if the person has the capacity and wants to go ahead. You have to surrender to God's Will and feel, "I will go in my own time. When my hour strikes, at that time I also will go to God."</p>
<p>Your wife was with you for twenty-eight years and now she is gone. But you have to know that for many years you did exist without her and now also you exist. If you care for that person, you have to feel, "The One who asked her to be in this room for a while has now taken her to another room. It is His House, His Mansion. He was the One who brought that person and He is the One who has taken her, so what right do I have to object?" Only by surrendering to God's Will can we get happiness. Otherwise, if we try to possess, we are miserable; if we are possessed, we are also miserable. True happiness, true fulfilment, lies only in becoming one with God's Will. There is no other way we can get fulfilment.</p>

MHOF 22-27. On 22 January 1993, Sri Chinmoy met with Dr. Hubert Reynolds, Professor of Peace Studies at Silliman University, at the South Seas Resort Hotel in Dumaguete. These are excerpts from their conversation.</p>
<h2>Professor Reynolds: I really appreciate your coming to a small city like Dumaguete.</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The life-tree has many branches. Some branches are large while others may be smaller than the smallest. But they belong to the same life-tree. Because we love the tree, we love all the branches. If we don't care for our little brothers, then why should our big brothers care for us?</p>

The whole peace process is so important.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Professor Reynolds: We appreciate you coming at this time. The whole peace process is so important." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everything in life has failed us or will eventually fail us if we do not achieve peace. We are running after success-life. But success can never give us joy because there is always somebody who is more successful than we are. If I become great in something, immediately I will see somebody who is greater.</p>
<p>When we live in the success-world, we are always competing with others; so we are always at the mercy of others. But when we care only for progress, we are not at anyone's mercy. We are only climbing up our own life-tree; we only want to transcend our own capacities. We have an inner urge to become a better person and a better citizen of the world, not by hook or by crook, but by sincere diligence.</p>
<p>So if we really want abiding satisfaction in our individual life and in our collective life, then we have to give paramount importance not to success but to progress, inner and outer. It is not that we are being self-centred. Only we feel that if we do not find inner peace and inner happiness, then everything else will have been in vain.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Professor Reynolds: How long have you been conducting these peace programmes?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Professor Reynolds: How long have you been conducting these peace programmes?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am a student of Socrates. He said "I am not an Athenian. I am a cosmopolitan." In my case also, I have come to serve the world. In 1964 I came to America from India. Then, in 1970 I started conducting meditations twice a week at the United Nations for the delegates and staff members who are interested in the spiritual life. There we also honour different countries, because we feel that each country has a soul and this soul is the direct representative of God. So we honour the different countries and try to bring to the fore their soul's qualities.</p>
<p>I have gone to many places and given talks on spirituality. Nineteen years ago I came to Silliman University and gave a talk at the Medical College. Doctors and nurses asked me questions, and I told them that spirituality and medical science are not enemies because their goals are the same. Both the doctor and the spiritual seeker are trying to cure human suffering. So they should stand on the same side in the tug-of-war against imperfection-disease. If doctors and spiritual people all pull together, then they are bound to win. In a family somebody may be a doctor, somebody may be a lawyer and somebody may be an engineer; but all are members of the same family, and when necessity demands, all have to stand together against ignorance.</p>
<p>Over the years I have given many talks at universities, but I did not succeed to my satisfaction in bringing to the fore the consciousness of the seekers. Then I decided to give Peace Concerts; I didn't want to be a talker anymore. I wanted to be a man of spirituality and silence. We know that music is next to spirituality. So I play a number of musical instruments, and through music I try to offer peace. I cannot expect each and every individual to like the same thing. That is why I play a number of different instruments. I usually play about 20. My goal is to be of service to mankind, and I feel I am amply rewarded if I can be of inspiration to a few people on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Professor Reynolds: I have been teaching a seminar on world peace for about 12 years. I have come to realise that the United Nations is a hopeful organisation although it does need some changes. Since you have been close to the United Nations, maybe you could make some suggestions.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Professor Reynolds: I have been teaching a seminar on world peace for about 12 years. I have come to realise that the United Nations is a hopeful organisation although it does need some changes. Since you have been close to the United Nations, maybe you could make some suggestions." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I do not make any suggestions. I am a student of peace. I go there to offer my services through my prayers and meditation, and many come to pray and meditate with me. We have come to realise from our prayer and meditation that the human mind as such cannot solve any world problems. What is needed is the aspiring heart. As soon as we use our mind, doubt comes to the fore. If you doubt me and I doubt you, how can we do anything together? This moment my mind tells me you are a nice man, and the next moment my mind says you are not a nice man. But who is my mind to judge? By judging someone I am not enlightening or illumining him. It is only by loving someone, by claiming him as my own, very own, that I can transform and illumine him. It is like a parent and a child. When the child does something wrong, the parents don't say, "Oh, you are a bad fellow. Go away!" No! By virtue of their compassion, affection and love, they feel that the child's defect is their own and that it is their bounden duty to save and illumine him.</p>
<p>The mind wants only to enjoy supremacy. For the mind, peace is being one step ahead of someone else. But if I want to be one step ahead of you and you want to be one step ahead of me, how can we have peace? The heart wants only oneness. With my heart-power I will try to claim you as my own. With my heart-power I will seek not to be one step ahead of you, but to walk side by side with you. So it is only heart-power that will bring about world peace.</p>
<p>The heart has the message and capacity of identification; the heart is all oneness. We feel our heart is synonymous with a home; we speak of a oneness-home. We go to work in various walks of life and come back home for the evening, where we enjoy our oneness with our family, our world-family. For real peace to be achieved, we need eagerness and enthusiasm. Enthusiasm we need in our minds, eagerness we need in our hearts and soulfulness we need in our life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when nations meet together to discuss peace, they are using their mind-power. They are trying to solve their problems mentally, not psychically. That is why the problems are still there and will always be there. If we enter into a room that is unlit, then how can we get light? The mind-room is unlit, whereas the heart-room is getting light directly from the soul, which gets the light directly from God. So, from Above, the light is coming down to purify and illumine our life. The light has already entered into the heart. Next it will have to enter into the mind. From the mind it will enter into the vital and then into the body.</p>
<p>Again, we have to know that receptivity is of paramount importance. The morning sun is for everybody. But if I keep my doors and windows closed, then the sun will not be able to come in. Since you have kept your windows and doors open, the sunlight is coming in and illumining your room. You are getting fresh hope, new inspiration and new aspiration. But I am continuing in my darkness-life.</p>
<p>The human mind only sings the song of division. Because my left arm is weaker than my right, my mind gives all importance to my right arm. But I know that if I didn't have a left arm, then people would say, "Look, he is imperfect." Perfection can be found only in the totality, and what the heart does is accept and embrace the totality. I have written many, many books, but they all have only one message: the heart's power of love must replace the mind's love of power. If I have the power of love, then I shall claim the whole world as my own. So at every moment we have to know whether we are using the heart-power to enlarge ourselves or the mind-power to blind and bind ourselves.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every year we go out to different countries and try to be of service to mankind. We feel that life is a tree. We want to climb up as many branches as possible, because each branch has its own beauty, its own purity, its own unique qualities and special message. We feel that each individual on earth is a special dream of God, and that it is the bounden duty of each and every individual to transform the particular dream that he embodies into a reality. How do we do it? Only by claiming the entire world as our own, very own. The world does not need another Julius Caesar or Napoleon to declare his superiority. This world needs someone who will say, "I came, I loved and I have become."</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right! What we have to conquer is our ignorance. By conquering others only the ego gets joy. The world does not need another Hiroshima or Nagasaki; it has got that experience. Now if you go to these places you see monuments to peace. Wisdom has dawned. Once upon a time we thought that destruction would bring joy. Now we see that joy comes only from peace, which is founded on the feeling of oneness and the realisation that we belong to one world-family. If you care for peace, you have to care for oneness. Oneness cannot be taken away from peace. They are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin.</p>
