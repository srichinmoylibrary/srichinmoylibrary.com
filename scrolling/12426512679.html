<p>Peace is not<br />  In my mind’s world-rejection.<br /> Peace is<br />  In my heart’s world-acceptance.</p>

<p>You are a Truth-seeker. I am a Truth-seeker. You are a God-lover and I am a God-lover.</p>
<p>You and I have the same God, yet we quarrel and fight. God asks you to trust me; you fail to obey God. God asks me the same thing, He asks me to trust you; hut I certainly fail.</p>
<p>You and I have the same God. God asks you to see Him inside me, and He asks me to see Him inside you. Both of us fail our Lord Beloved Supreme. You see in me countless imperfections when you look at me. I do the same when I look at you. You do not see in me the Presence of God. I do not see in you the Presence of God. You do not see anything divine, inspiring, aspiring, illumining and fulfilling in me. Alas, I also fail to see in you anything divine, inspiring, illumining and fulfilling. Both of us fail our Lord Beloved Supreme.</p>
<p>You and I have the same God. You think and you know and you feel that your God is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. I, too, see and feel the same. But when you look at me, you think I am imperfection incarnate, you feel I am past correction. You forget that your God is omnipotent. If so is His Will, He can perfect my life in the twinkling of an eye. Similarly, when I see your countless imperfections, I fail to see the Presence — the loving and benevolent Presence — of my Lord Beloved Supreme. I, too, forget the fact that my God, whom I claim to be my God, is omnipotent. If your God is omnipotent and if my God is omnipotent, how is it that we cannot have faith in God’s Power Supreme? You can pray to God for my perfection; I can pray to God for your perfection. This is one way for us to make God happy, although it may take a long time for you to see my perfection and, vice versa, for me also to see perfection in you. But the very fact that you and I are praying mutually for our mutual perfection will make our Lord Beloved Supreme happy far beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>You and I have the same God, yet we disagree most of the time and we quarrel and fight. You and I pray to God for happiness. We pray to God and we speak to God. You say to God, “O God, please make me happy first and then I shall make You happy. You please fulfil all my teeming desires. Once I am happy, then I shall make You happy, O Lord Supreme.” This is your prayer. I, too, have the exact same prayer. I say to my Lord Supreme, “My Lord, please fulfil my desires first, all my desires please fulfil, then I shall definitely make You happy. First make me happy, then I shall unfailingly and undoubtedly make You happy.”</p>
<p>Here, in this case, you and I are sailing in the same boat. We want our happiness first, and then God’s Happiness. But God says to us, “Since you are begging Me for happiness, pleading with Me, it is you who have to make Me happy first, not the other way around.” And, again, God says to us, “My children, if I make you happy first, it will be the fulfilment of your desire-life. No matter how many times I fulfil your desires in order to make you happy, I will not be able to make you happy, never! But if you make Me happy first, on the strength of your aspiration-life, then you will feel that in My Happiness alone your happiness can be discovered, for I am the Source of all happiness. So please, My children, be wise. Make Me happy first. Then you are bound to be happy, and this happiness will last forever.”</p>
<p>You and I have the same God. You want to see perfection in me. I want to see perfection in you. By speaking to God day in and day out against me, do you not think you are displeasing God and irritating God? For He is all Compassion for both of us. Again, I do the same. I speak ill of you to God at every moment. I think that by speaking ill of you, I am making my point clear to God, I am making God feel I am far better than you. “Oh no, that is not the way,” my Lord Supreme tells me. We have to see all the divine qualities in each other to make our Lord Supreme happy. Our imperfect nature can only be transformed by His Compassion-Eye and Forgiveness-Heart.</p>
<p>You and I have the same God. You are God-thirsty and God-hungry; this is absolutely true. I, too, am God-thirsty and God-hungry. But if our hunger is genuine and if, at every moment, we want to be fed and nourished by God’s Nectar-Delight, by His infinite Compassion, infinite Love and Light and Delight, then can we have even a fraction of a moment to think of each other? When I think of you, I think of your imperfections, your weaknesses. You do the same. Such being the case, who is actually our Lord? We pray to God for five minutes a day, but we think of each other for ten or twelve hours a day.</p>
<p>When we accept the spiritual life, we make a fervent promise to our soul, to our heart, to our inner life, to our Inner Pilot, that we shall always think of God, our Lord Beloved Supreme. And yet, instead of thinking of our Lord Beloved Supreme at every moment, you think of me daily for hours and I also do the same with regard to you. You think of God for just ten minutes a day. I do exactly the same, not a minute more than you. So we have made each other our God, and poor God, the real God, is buried in oblivion in our ignorance-mind and ignorance-life.</p>
<p>No, my friend, since we wish to sail in the same boat, the boat of aspiration, the boat that will lead us to our destined Goal, the Golden Shore, let us believe in our oneness-education; let us start today with our oneness-education. This oneness-education is founded upon our mutual aspiration and reciprocal dedication. Together we must aspire, in spite of our weaknesses, difficulties and imperfections. Together we must raise our consciousness to high, higher, highest heights. Together let us sail in the same boat, the boat that will take us to our Destination, the Golden Shore. Our Beloved Supreme is eagerly waiting for our arrival. Let us make Him happy in His own Way, and His own Way means our oneness-education, oneness-perfection, oneness-satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Sri Chinmoy&#039;s Peace Concert and talk dedicated to Sri Aurobindo</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Sri Chinmoy&#039;s Peace Concert and talk dedicated to Sri Aurobindo" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The Reverend George Pattison, Dean of King’s College Chapel, University of Cambridge:</p>
<p>Good afternoon and welcome to King’s Chapel. We are here because this is the College that was attended between 1890 and 1892 by Sri Aurobindo, who was here as a student of Classics. We know that he would have attended worship in this chapel, and he would have attended it daily, because in those days students had to. They had no choice, whether they liked it or not. He was a very successful student here. One of the great teachers of the College, Oscar Browning, praised his essay on a comparison of Shakespeare and Milton as the best he had examined in thirteen years. Those who know of Oscar Browning know he was not the sort of teacher who said nice things when he did not have to!</p>
<p>Because it is, in a sense, Sri Aurobindo who has brought us here, I thought I would just very briefly read some short words from his essay, “Our Ideal.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What then shall be our ideal? Unity for the human race by an inner oneness and not only by an external association of interests; the resurgence of man out of the merely animal and economic life or the merely intellectual and aesthetic into the glories of the spiritual existence; the pouring of the power of the spirit into the physical mould and mental instrument so that man may develop his manhood into that true supermanhood which shall exceed our present state as much as this exceeds the animal state from which Science tells us that we have issued. These three are one; for man’s unity and man’s self-transcendence can come only by living in the Spirit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these words from Sri Aurobindo, I would like to introduce His Excellency, the High Commissioner for India, Dr. Singhvi, who will introduce Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>H.E. DR. L.M. Singhvi, High Commissioner for India to the United Kingdom:</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy, Vice-Chancellor, Vice-Provost, Dean Pattison, ladies and gentlemen, this is a wonderful occasion, a soul-stirring and heart-warming occasion; an occasion that brings to the world the sense of our cosmic togetherness; an occasion which is meant to be a homage to Sri Aurobindo, whose portraits from childhood to the great status of a sage and seer that he achieved we see before us. He represents to us the message and the living legacy of not only India’s heritage but of the quest of the Spirit throughout the world. And that this should happen in this beautiful chapel — which gives us back, at least for the while that we are here, a sense of the sacred, architecturally and in terms of ambiance — is very significant.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to introduce Sri Chinmoy because of his versatility. He has an extraordinary versatility, which has taken him into different walks of life, with great mastery of that which characterises the message of India. He writes, not as we all write, but from the heart and the soul of the heritage of India. He paints, not as all other painters do, but he paints the soaring birds, the birds unfolding their wings; he paints the birds speaking to us, each bird bringing to us the mantra of Heaven. He has painted millions of birds, literally millions of birds, and no two birds that he has painted are really alike. That must be one of the most monumental achievements. When he sings, when he performs, when he plays his music, that is not the music that we are accustomed to. It is the music of the soul. And he conveys this experience through a large variety of instruments, some of which he has himself created, and many of which are part of the heritage of humankind.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy is a man with a mission. His mission is peace. His endeavours are consecrated to the cause of peace. For the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, he gave fifty Peace Concerts in fifty cities of the world. And, in Edinburgh, he asked me to go with him to dedicate a bridge of peace. It is one of the most beautiful bridges in Scotland and the city invited us to dedicate that bridge as a Peace Bridge. What does it mean? It means the resonance of the message that we all need. It means the reiteration of the principles with which we are familiar, but which we are prone to neglect or ignore.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy has a large following. But beyond the many followers that he has, there are many who have seen him perform, there are many who have read his books, there are many who have seen his millions of paintings, and there are many who have only seen him. Seeing him is believing in the divine Presence in all of us. That is India’s heritage.</p>
<p>He and I are very close to each other. I feel a certain sense of friendly bonding with him. He is a saint, a seer, a poet, a musician, a painter, but more than anything else, he is a philosopher for the day after tomorrow — for the world not of tomorrow hut the day after tomorrow. And his vision is as fresh as all our pasts and all our futures. I am honoured to be asked to introduce Sri Chinmoy in this beautiful, inspiring chapel. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy (bowing with folded hands and speaking privately to Dr. Singhvi): My highly esteemed Brother-Friend, your blessingful heart is made of infinite compassion and my soulful heart is made of infinite gratitude.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy then began his Peace Concert. He meditated for a few moments at the front of the stage with folded hands and bowed to the audience. Taking his seat in the centre of the stage, surrounded by large photographs of Sri Aurobindo, Sri Chinmoy performed on the North Indian esraj, the Western flute, an Australian-made lute, and harmonium.</p>
<p>Afterwards he offered a talk entitled “Sri Aurobindo: A Glimpse,” excerpts of which appear on the following pages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Slowly the Light grows greater in the East.”</p>
<p><em>Savitri</em> — Sri Aurobindo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 15th, 1872, Sri Aurobindo took human birth in Calcutta, Bengal, to awaken Mother Earth from her somnolence deep and lead her to the heights of God-rapture-fire. For seventy-eight fleeting years did this mightiest of souls live among us, accepting the world pain and making sacrifice after sacrifice to transform humanity’s age-old ignorance into perfect Perfection. (“My God is Love and sweetly suffers all.” Savitri — Sri Aurobindo)</p>
<p>When Aurobindo was just seven years old, his father took him and his two older brothers to England to receive their education. Aurobindo was to remain in England for fourteen years, far removed from his parents and his homeland. He attended St. Paul’s School in West Kensington, London, and was accepted into King’s College, Cambridge, as an Indian Civil Service (I.C.S.) probationer. Aurobindo was at Cambridge from October 1890 to October 1892. At the end of his studies, Aurobindo secured a First Class result in Latin and Greek, but was disqualified from the open I.C.S. examination for failing to present himself for the riding test. In later years, Sri Aurobindo revealed that he was wandering the streets of London at the time of his appointment. He had resolved to bring about his rejection from the I.C.S. because he felt no call for the administrative life. He preferred poetry, literature, the study of languages and patriotic activities.</p>
<p>At this time, he was introduced to the Gaekwar of Baroda, who offered him a position in his State Secretariat. Aurobindo accepted the position and decided to sail for India in January 1893. Aurobindo’s father was extremely attached to this son, whom he had not seen for fourteen years. He had almost intuitive high hopes that his Auro was to brighten the face of India. Alas, the ship which was to carry Aurobindo sank off the coast of Portugal. On the assumption that his son must have perished with the lost ship, his father died of a broken heart. But Aurobindo had boarded a second ship and he reached India safely in February 1893.</p>
<p>As soon as Aurobindo stepped on India’s soil at Apollo Bunder, Bombay, he had a most significant spiritual experience. His entire being was inundated with peace. The all-pervading Presence of the Infinite he felt. This lofty experience came to him unsought. Aurobindo’s father had been an atheist and his children’s upbringing in England did not encompass spirituality. Aurobindo’s spiritual experiences came to him gradually.</p>
<p>Aurobindo spent thirteen years in the Baroda State Service, first in the Secretariat, later as Professor of French and English, and finally as Vice-Principal of the Baroda State College. When one of his students ventured the question, “How can nationalism be developed?” Aurobindo replied, pointing to a wall map of India:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Look at that map. Learn to find in it the portrait of Bharat Mata. The cities, mountains, rivers and forests are the materials which go to make up Her body. The people inhabiting the country are the cells which go to make up Her living tissues. Our literature is Her memory and speech. The spirit of our culture is Her soul. The happiness and freedom of Her children is Her salvation. Behold Bharat as a living Mother, meditate upon Her and worship Her in the nine-fold way of bhakti.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consecrated to India’s independence from his Cambridge days, Aurobindo devoted his spare time at Baroda to learning Indian languages, absorbing Indian culture and practising yoga. He conducted secret societies for work towards independence and wrote articles constructively criticising the thinking of India’s political leaders of the National Congress.</p>
<p>In 1906 Aurobindo left Baroda for Bengal. He became the Principal of the Bengal National College. He entered into the vortex of the Bengal national movement. Aurobindo was at once the cynosure and the sanctum sanctorum of Bengal’s heart-shrine.</p>
<p>While Principal of the Bengal National College, he conducted the journals <em>Bande Mataram</em> in English and <em>Yugantar</em> in Bengali. A leader of the secret societies, he also worked ceaselessly, publicly and behind the scenes, sowing the seeds of love of country and her independence in the national mind and heart.</p>
<p>As Aurobindo’s stars were ascending in Bengal politics, India’s greatest poet, Rabindranath Tagore — a patriot and nationalist of the supreme height — proudly and unreservedly voiced forth from his unhorizoned vision-eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Aurobindo, do accept Rabindranath’s salutations! O my friend, O our country’s friend, You embody the living message-image-light Of our Mother India’s soul.”</p>
<p><em>(translated from the original Bengali)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1907 Aurobindo resigned from the Bengal National College. At his farewell party, his dear students made a loving demand of him to bless them with encouraging and illumining advice as to how they could become choice and worthy sons of Mother India. He responded with a most significant speech, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are times in a nation’s history when Providence places before it one work, one aim, to which everything else, however high and noble in itself, has to be sacrificed. Such a time has now arrived for our Motherland when nothing is dearer than Her service, when everything else is to be directed to that end. Work that She may prosper. Suffer that She may rejoice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 4th, 1908, Aurobindo was suddenly arrested on charges of sedition and imprisoned in Alipore Jail. He was to remain there for twelve months. This period of enforced seclusion was actually a blessing in disguise for Aurobindo. It enabled him to carry on his yoga uninterrupted and he passed hour after hour in his cramped cell in silent contemplation. For fifteen days he vividly heard the voice of Swami Vivekananda speaking to him about the Supermind. As Aurobindo Ghose progressed towards his God-realisation, he had the vision of Vasudeva, Lord Krishna, everywhere and in everything. Sri Krishna assured him that He would work in and through Aurobindo’s junior counsel, Chitta Ranjan Das, to secure Aurobindo’s acquittal.</p>
<p>There would be no need for Aurobindo even to involve himself in the trial. Lord Krishna advised him to remain silent. Aurobindo felt in the inmost recesses of his heart that each surrender-step of his to Lord Krishna would become an entirely new creation. In this way, Aurobindo conquered once and for all his imprisonment-release-doubt-troops.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna also gave Aurobindo direct assurance that India’s independence would be achieved — but that the rest of the work towards that end would be carried out by others, while he himself would have to work for a higher Cause. While concluding the case for the defence, C.R. Das said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My appeal to you is this — that long after this turmoil, this agitation will have ceased, long after he is dead and gone, he will be looked upon as the poet of patriotism, as the prophet of nationalism and the lover of humanity. Long after he is dead and gone, his words will be echoed and re-echoed not only in India but across distant seas and lands.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after his acquittal on May 6th, 1909, Sri Aurobindo delivered his historic Uttarpara Speech in which he vividly described his direct experiences of God in Alipore Jail. He concluded by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is the <em>Sanatan Dharma</em> which for us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the <em>Sanatan Dharma</em>, with it it moves and with it it grows. When the <em>Sanatan Dharma</em> declines, and if the <em>Sanatan Dharma</em> were capable of perishing, with the <em>Sanatan Dharma</em> it would perish. The <em>Sanatan Dharma</em>, that is nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to give a wider voice to his views and those of other nationalists, Sri Aurobindo started two publications: the <em>Dharma</em> in Bengali and the <em>Karmayogin</em> in English. In 1910 he received an <em>Adesh</em> or ‘Command’ from Above and abruptly quit all his political activities. He retired into seclusion, first at French Chandernagore, then at French Pondicherry, to work for the greater Cause of the world’s spiritual transformation and divinisation.</p>
<p>From 1910 to 1920, from his base at Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo conducted the <em>Arya</em>, a philosophical monthly into which he poured his spirituality-flooded message. These writings formed the basis of his major works: <em>The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on the Gita</em> and many more. He also wrote essays on poetry and literature, including <em>The Future Poetry, Hymns to the Mystic Fire</em> and two volumes of <em>Collected Poems and Plays</em>. His last and greatest work is <em>Savitri</em>, the epitome of spiritual autobiography. It is an epic of 23,814 lines, far surpassing in height, depth and length any epic in Greek, Latin, English, Italian or German. It is, indeed, a new Veda for the New Age.</p>
<p>On November 24th, 1926, Sri Aurobindo attained to his spiritual perfection. He withdrew from all contacts and put into the hands of his spiritual Collaborator, the Mother, the disciples who had gathered around him. This marked the beginning of the Ashram at Pondicherry.</p>
<p>For over twenty-four years, with the Mother working in front, he continued with his yoga, not caring to rest on the laurels of his first Victory, but pushing upward till he found himself within sight of his supreme and final Victory which alone could achieve the end of his Mission: the descent of what he called the Supermind into the very cells of his physical body.</p>
<p>India’s independence was won on August 15th, 1947. Most significantly, this was Sri Aurobindo’s own Birth Day. He was requested to offer a message to the free nation, and he began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“August 15th, 1947 is the birthday of free India. It marks for her the end of an old era, the beginning of a new age. But we can also make it, by our life and acts as a free nation, an important date in a new age opening for the whole world, for the political, social, cultural and spiritual future of humanity.</p>
<p>August 15th is my own birthday and it is naturally gratifying to me that it should have assumed this vast significance. I take this coincidence, not as a fortuitous accident, hut as the sanction and seal of the Divine Force that guides my steps on the work with which I began life, the beginning of its full fruition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the age of seventy-eight, for purposes of his own, Sri Aurobindo decided to part with his body, and he carried out this decision on December 5th, 1950, after a brief “illness.”</p>
<p>And now, with the kind permission of your souls, I would like to share with you some of my most precious outer possessions and memories. When I joined the Ashram in 1944 as a young boy of twelve years old, I received from Sri Aurobindo a copy of his book <em>Kara Kahani</em> <em>(Tales of Prison Life)</em>. Sri Aurobindo had blessingfully written down my name, Chinmoy, in his own handwriting. Needless to say, I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>At the Ashram I had many mentors who encouraged my literary attempts. In 1946 I was inspired to render one of Sri Aurobindo’s Bengali stories about the Vedic sages Vasishtha and Vishwamitra into Bengali verse. Sri Aurobindo’s story is called <em>“Kshamar Adarsha” (“The Ideal of Forgiveness”)</em>. My poem ran to about two hundred lines. Timidly and devotedly, I submitted it to the Mother. Out of her infinite compassion for me, the Mother gave it to Sri Aurobindo. In a few days’ time, at four-thirty in the afternoon, I was on my way to the volleyball ground. One of Sri Aurobindo’s dearest attendants, Mulshankar, stopped me and said, “Chinmoy, Nirod is reading out to Sri Aurobindo your long poem and Sri Aurobindo is smiling.” When I heard this, I was in the seventh Heaven of delight! A few hours later, Nirod-da sent for me and returned the poem. He told me that Sri Aurobindo had remarked: “It is a fine piece of poetry. He has capacity. Tell him to continue.”</p>
<p>In 1948 I translated one of my Bengali poems about India’s independence into English and, as usual, with utmost timidity, I gave the Mother the poem. Smiling, Mother said to me, “I know it is for Sri Aurobindo that you are giving it to me.” She took it from me to give to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>In 1958 I began writing a play about the Life of Sri Aurobindo, entitled <em>The Descent of the Blue</em>, and I was told by Champaklal, Sri Aurobindo’s sleeplessly self-giving assistant, that the Mother enjoyed hearing my play. It was published serially in the Mother India.</p>
<p>In 1959, on my birthday, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram manager, Amrita, a pioneer-pillar-disciple whose name, meaning ‘Nectar; Immortality’, was bestowed upon him by his Lord Sri Aurobindo himself, presented me with a Parker fountain pen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Chinmoy, I am giving you my most precious and my most treasured possession. This was the pen our Lord gave me on one of my birthdays many years ago, long before you were born. He himself used it many, many times.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, my prayerful heart is all gratitude to the Divine Mother for granting me the invaluable blessing-opportunity to be allowed to meditate every morning very early in front of the Mother’s and Sri Aurobindo’s pictures at the place where they used to give Darshan four times a year and also at the two doors of Sri Aurobindo’s main room. This unimaginable privilege started in 1958 and continued until 1964 when I came to America.</p>
<p>No more about myself. Aurobindo’s Cambridge and Sri Aurobindo’s Mother India more, ever more!</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo and Sri Aurobindo’s mind saw and studied England.</p>
<p>India and India’s heart received and treasured Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>The world and the world’s soul adored and loved Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p>The Universe and the Lord of the Universe claimed, claim, and forever and forever shall claim Sri Aurobindo.</p>

<p>Aurobindo saw.<br />Sri Aurobindo became.</p>
<p>Aurobindo — the boldest revolution.<br />Sri Aurobindo — the quickest evolution.</p>
<p>Aurobindo — “British, out!”<br />Sri Aurobindo — “World-ignorance, out, out, out!”</p>
<p>Aurobindo — a Cambridge-education-zenith-mind.<br />Sri Aurobindo — a world-illumination-Soul<br />And the earth-transformation-Harbinger.</p>
<p>Aurobindo — “Cambridge, you gave me<br />The vastness-knowledge-light.”<br />Sri Aurobindo — ’’Cambridge, I give you<br />And the whole world<br />Oneness-nectar-delight.”</p>
<p>Aurobindo was<br />A world-mind-traveller-hunger<br />Par excellence.<br />Sri Aurobindo is<br />A cosmos-heart-lover-feast<br />Infinite.</p>
<p>Aurobindo came down.<br />Sri Aurobindo went up<br />Only to be all-where.</p>
<p>In England, a waking lion.<br />In Baroda, a watching lion.<br />In Bengal, a roaring lion.<br />In Pondicherry, an all-conquering lion.</p>
<p>Within, Aurobindo heard.<br />Without, Sri Aurobindo sounds.</p>
<p>Aurobindo’s heart<br />Was a God-dreamer.<br />Sri Aurobindo’s life<br />Is a God-giver.</p>
<p>Aurobindo — the perfect definition<br />Of a God-oneness-seeker.<br />Sri Aurobindo — the absolute definition<br />Of God the Supreme.</p>
<p>In Bengal, he was<br />An India-lover,<br />India-awakener<br />And India-server.</p>
<p>In Pondicherry, he became<br />A God-seer,<br />God-possessor<br />And God-distributor.</p>
<p>Aurobindo saw the world.<br />Sri Aurobindo fought for the world<br />And so does he still.</p>
<p>His <em>The Life Divine</em><br />Is God the man’s<br />Aspiration-victory-song.</p>
<p>His <em>Savitri</em><br />Is man the God’s<br />Transformation-manifestation-gong.</p>
<p>Aurobindo accepted humanity’s imperfections<br />As his own.<br />God accepted Sri Aurobindo<br />To claim His Perfection<br />As his own, very own.</p>
<p>Aurobindo was humanity’s<br />Life-temple-beauty.<br />Sri Aurobindo is Divinity’s<br />Heart-Shrine-Fragrance.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo is caught<br />By both man and God alike —<br />Man for his transformation;<br />God for His manifestation.</p>
