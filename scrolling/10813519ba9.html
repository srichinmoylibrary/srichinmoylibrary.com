<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only one thing beautiful about the mind: eventually it does come to realise that light is necessary, that the feeling of oneness is necessary, and at that time it recognises and confesses its countless mistakes. This realisation, recognition and confession are themselves a true form of inner beauty.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I say somebody has a beautiful soul, it does not mean he has a certain coloured aura. It means that the person has received Light, Peace and Delight from above to a considerable extent, and that these divine qualities have come to the fore in him and are being manifested in the earth-consciousness. It may be, however, that the possessor of these qualities is not aware of them. But when a Master discloses the fact, the seeker gets the immediate opportunity to recognise them, increase them and utilise them for a divine cause in his own life and in the life of aspiring humanity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God the Father and God the Mother have one heart, one soul, one physical consciousness. But the individual will see them according to his understanding or capacity. Each individual is given the opportunity to appreciate their Beauty either together or separately. One individual will say that God the Father is more beautiful and another will say that God the Mother is more beautiful. But God the Father and God the Mother are not like human beings who have only one appearance. If the individual is totally identified with God the Father or God the Mother on the physical plane or in the earth-consciousness, then inside God the Father he is bound to see God the Mother, and inside God the Mother he is bound to see God the Father. Their Beauty cannot be separated.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A disciple can have more gratitude for his Master through self-giving. By self-giving the disciple becomes what he wanted to be and infinitely more. He wanted to have an iota of Peace, a little Light, a little Bliss. That was his hope. But when he begins real self-giving to a divine cause inside his Master, then, instead of just an iota, he is given Peace, Light and Bliss in infinite measure. But again, if the seeker feels while giving that he will get much more in return, that is not real self-giving. It is a bargain. While giving he has to feel that even if he does not get anything in return, he will give because he is getting inspiration from within. Whether he will get something in return from his Master or the Supreme in his Master is not his business. His business is to give, and it is the business of the Supreme whether or not to give something in return. If the disciple feels that he is getting the utmost joy while giving and if he is not thinking that he will get infinitely more in return, then gratitude is bound to dawn in his life. When a seeker gives spontaneously with joy, if the action itself gives joy and not the expected result, then automatically the seeker's life is blessed. And inside this blessing the seeker's gratitude toward the Supreme inside his Master is growing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Oneness itself is beauty. There cannot be any beauty higher or more illumining and fulfilling than oneness. Just because the world is lacking in oneness, the world is suffering. When there is oneness, beauty is automatically there. God has the universal Consciousness at His disposal; that is why He is all Beauty. When there is inseparable oneness, that oneness itself is beauty. It is the self-revealing light of the divine within us.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, there is no correlation at all. There have been many spiritual Masters who were physically quite ugly, and there have been many who were very beautiful. If you ask God whether my soul is more beautiful or more developed than that of some handsome movie actor, God will sincerely tell you that my soul is far more developed. It depends entirely on God's Will and on the individual soul's will what kind of house his soul will live in. If somebody has plenty of money, even then he may not care for a big mansion. He feels that a small room is enough. And somebody who has very little money will spend everything he has to rent a big house to show off. But this big house may get him into tremendous financial difficulty. Then he has to get a loan from the bank in order to pay the rent, and perhaps he will not be able to buy proper food for himself. So, although he has a very big house, he is starving and bankrupt. The beauty that we see in spiritual Masters is the soul's beauty rather than physical beauty. That beauty does not create any problems, either for its possessor or for others. Just because of your aspiration you see their inner beauty and you accept them because of it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> School work and other work must be taken as a part of self-discipline. The result of self-discipline is satisfaction. If we care for satisfaction, we have to feel that inside our self-discipline there is nothing but the revealing light of beauty.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! Outer cheerfulness considerably helps in developing and increasing our inner beauty. But this outer cheerfulness, like everything else in the spiritual life, has to be sincere. Some people come up to me with folded hands and show all kinds of false devotion. Devotion is necessary in the spiritual life, but if you just fold your hands and bow down because somebody else is doing it, that is all useless insincerity. In everything we do we can be very sincere or we can be very insincere. If we are sincere, then we get something from the Supreme. But if we are not sincere, we will get nothing. So cheerfulness also has to be spontaneous. It has to come naturally from within and not just be something you are creating or showing off with. If you have that kind of cheerfulness, your inner beauty is bound to grow, because that kind of cheerfulness will help you tremendously in your spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you are with your older spiritual brothers, you have to feel that you are only one year old. Show all your innocent qualities to them. They will be pleased with your childlike simplicity, and not with your cleverness or how much you know. But when you are in front of your equals or your younger brothers, at that time you won't be strict or complicated. You will maintain your childlike quality, but also you have to prove to them that you have some wisdom, some light. Just as you are inspired by the wisdom of your superiors, others have to be inspired by your wisdom and height. When you are with your younger brothers, feel that they have to come up to your height of sincerity and light. And when you are with your elder brothers, try to climb up the ladder to their height. When you are with the little ones, at that time keep your divine dignity, but not pride. And when you are with the older ones, have the feeling that you are climbing up to them. In this way, you won't lose your childlike simplicity. When I cut jokes with you people, I become much younger than you. And when I become serious, at that time you can hardly approach me. When I meditate, at that time I am somebody else. This moment I act like your real spiritual father — very stern and strict — because I have to inspire you to go up the ladder. And the next moment, when I cut jokes with you, I act like someone who is much younger than you. If you can do this, then you can be both spiritually mature and childlike.</p>

Can you speak about this?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is all in the mind. Just go one inch above the mind and you will see that purity and beauty, and power and dynamism, are neither masculine nor feminine. The mind makes these separations like feminine and masculine. But once we go beyond the mind, there is nothing of that sort. With the mind we judge things, and this becomes masculine and that becomes feminine. In French my head becomes 'la tete', and my nose becomes 'le nez'. So my head is feminine and my nose is masculine. But this is all arbitrary. That is why the Indian term for God, 'Brahman', is neuter. The highest realisation of all Indian Seers was that God is neither masculine nor feminine. Beyond the mind there is no such thing as masculine and feminine. Even the soul is neither masculine nor feminine. It is absolutely neuter.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is our inner beauty due to the Grace of God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is our inner beauty due to the Grace of God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, inner beauty is undoubtedly the result of God's Grace. Is there anything good, divine or progressive that we can get or do without the Grace of God? Inner beauty is life's satisfaction and life's perfection. How can we get life's satisfaction and perfection from anybody or anything but God? And God and God's Grace, God and God's Compassion, are inseparable. There is nothing we can do without God's Grace. Just because God's Grace is there, you are praying and meditating and trying to realise God. Perhaps your friends and relatives are leading a very undivine life. Their time has not come. God's Grace has not been received by them. So you have to be so grateful to God that God has awakened you, whereas your friends and relatives are not yet awakened. Anything good that we do, anything good that we become, comes directly from God. Without God's Grace we cannot budge an inch. I will tell you an interesting incident. Once one of my elder brothers, who is very spiritual, entered into a kind of joking discussion with a mentor of mine. They were very fond of each other, so my brother was cutting jokes with this elderly man. My mentor said, "Without God's Grace nothing can happen. And again, with God's Grace everything can happen." My brother said, "All right, you just give me a gun and I will see whether I need God's Grace to shoot you. Then, after I kill you, let me see what God's Grace can do for you!" So my mentor said, "Just because God knows you are going to shoot me, God is not giving you a gun right now. If this is not God's Grace, what else is God's Grace?" So my brother lost the case.</p>

<p>Over the course of his numerous university lecture tours and at his various spiritual Centres around the world, Sri Chinmoy has answered thousands of spiritual questions. But perhaps none are of such widespread interest as this series of questions on the subject of beauty, which he answered during a meeting of his Connecticut Centre on September 14, 1974.</p>
<p>What exactly is beauty? What is its meaning and spiritual significance? How does it reveal itself in different planes of consciousness?</p>
<p>Questions like these have fascinated philosophers and poets from the beginning of time, but it is rare indeed for a God-realised spiritual Master to discuss these matters. This volume reveals the quintessence of beauty as seen by the inner vision of a great Yogi. The revelations offered here represent a unique treasure which will always be cherished in the hearts of spiritual seekers and lovers of beauty the world over.</p>
