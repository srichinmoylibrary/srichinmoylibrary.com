<p>Five or six years ago I was running in London in front of Kensington Gardens. A car came so close to me that I got frightened and jumped onto the sidewalk. A man came out of the car and said, "We are your disciples."</p>
<p>Then the whole family came out. It was Kaivalya, Bhavani and their two boys. I did not recognise them, even though they had already come to New York. Now I know the family so well.</p>

<p>Today there was a racewalk in Central Park. I started walking long before the race began. A tall young man, 25 or 26 years old, saw me twice. The second time he saw me, he came up to me and asked, "How is it that you are walking faster than I am?"</p>
<p>I said to him, "How is it that you are walking slower than I am?"</p>
<p>Then he patted me on the shoulder. He looked as if he were taking a morning walk.</p>

<p>Luckily some disciples joined the racewalk today. Otherwise, there would have been only five or six walkers. We contributed nine walkers. The organisers said, "We are so happy. Today we have the largest number of participants in this race."</p>
<p>Our people were singing songs very loudly right in front of the counters. Five or six girls were singing "Aspiration-Sky" and other songs to inspire the walkers. I thought they would be scolded by the organisers, but nobody said anything.</p>

<p>When I had walked only two or three hundred metres, one of the scorers said I was not straightening my legs properly. There were two judges — the supreme judge, who would throw people out of the race, and another man. A girl who was the assistant to one of the judges was telling him about me, saying, "He is not walking properly."</p>
<p>The big shot said, "Don't bother him!" He knew I was last. If you are last, why do you have to get a warning?</p>
<p>Later, the judge introduced himself to me. His name was Howard Jacobson. He was the one who organised the race.</p>

<p>Howard was going to this side and that side to check if people were walking properly. He was very serious. While he was moving around, so many articles of clothing he took off: his trousers, jacket, red tie and hat!</p>
<p>Howard would show the walkers a particular card when they were not walking properly. If he showed them a card with a "V" on it, it meant they were out of the race.</p>
<p>Poor Subarata got one or two warnings. She was ahead of me, but she was nowhere near the other walkers. They were up to eight miles and perhaps she was struggling at one or two miles. Still, she got a warning. Then her husband also got a warning.</p>

<p>He said you have to strike always with the heel first. Our people were touching with the toes or the middle of the foot.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Advice from the racewalking expert</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Advice from the racewalking expert" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Howard is the great authority in New York on racewalking. He has written a book about it. When I had walked 800 metres, Howard came over to me and said, "You are in pain, I can see. Do you want to walk?"</p>
<p>I said, "Still I will try to walk a little."</p>
<p>After I walked two and a half miles, he came up to me again and grabbed me in a very kind, affectionate way. He said, "Can you do me a big favour? I want to speak to you."</p>
<p>Then he took me off of the course and told me, "When you are in pain, never walk. It is hurting me to watch you."</p>
<p>I said, "I was in pain. That's why I gave up running."</p>
<p>He said, "Now you should give up walking."</p>
<p>I said, "I have read your book. I have learned so much from it."</p>
<p>He said, "Thank you. Do you have a chiropractor?"</p>
<p>I answered, "I have four or five, but they cannot cure me."</p>
<p>"I had the same experience," he said. "But at last I went to a chiropractor who is so good that she cured me. If you go to her, she will cure you. Where is your pain?"</p>
<p>I explained where my pain was and he said, "I had exactly the same thing. Do you know the source? This doctor found the source: right under the shoulder, near the right side of the spine."</p>
<p>Then he sat on the ground and straightened my leg, and then pulled it. I was in such pain! He said, "I had the same pain. You should go to my chiropractor."</p>
<p>After that he said, "I won't allow you to walk anymore. First you have to be cured."</p>
<p>I asked him about breathing. In his book he had mentioned inhaling for two counts and exhaling for two counts. He demonstrated this, going two or three metres from this side to that side. He was breathing in and out: "Hoo! Hoo!"</p>
<p>He asked me, "Can you hear me?"</p>
<p>Then he ran away to give advice to some of the other walkers.</p>
<p>Later I sent Bipin to talk to him and get his chiropractor's name. Her name is Dr. Kirk. I have asked Laurajean to learn from her, and then teach her husband, Avery. Then Avery will treat me.</p>

<p>I started the 5-kilometre race in Flushing Meadow Park yesterday evening way at the back. I am always afraid that the other runners will stamp on me when they start. I was just five metres behind Lavanya. Only one person was behind me — a lame, fat man. I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, I started passing people. My first victim was Mitali. Mitali is a rogue! As soon as she saw me passing, she stopped and started tying her shoelaces.</p>
<p>After one mile and 400 metres I saw a man with an artificial leg ahead of me. Can you imagine! What was I doing so far back?</p>
<p>Then I saw that Varayuvati and Prasannata were ahead of me. I felt that they were going so slowly, but I wasgoing even slower! Eventually I passed them. I also passed quite a few others.</p>

<p>I was running behind two ladies — an old lady and her friend. For a while I got stuck there. First I was behind them. Then I went ahead of them 15 or 20 metres. When the old lady saw I was going ahead of them, she couldn't bear it. She started running side by side with me. Then I started taking long strides. My knee was hurting me, and I said to myself, "Is it worth it?" Then I said, "Yes, it is worth it!"</p>
<p>Finally the old lady gave me a smile and fell back. Near the end I looked behind to see where she was, but I couldn't see her at all.</p>

<p>As I was finishing the 5-kilometre race, I saw many people near the finish line. In the last 100 metres, an old man was telling an old lady, "Sri Chinmoy is finishing. He is going ahead of you. Go ahead of him!" But I was sprinting and she could not go ahead of me.</p>
<p>After we finished she asked me what our timing was. But how could I tell her her timing when I was ahead of her? I heard 31:07 for myself, but she was 10 or 15 metres behind me.</p>

<p>The other day at around 4:00 I was coming back from Queens Boulevard. At my one-mile-and-400-metre mark a young man stopped his car and said, "Can you tell me how to get to Roslyn Park?"</p>
<p>Where is Roslyn Park? I smiled at him and said, "I do not know."</p>
<p>He said, "You have a very cute smile."</p>
<p>So he forgave me. Sometimes when you can't give people directions, their mantra is, "Go to hell!"</p>
<p>About three weeks ago I was near Flushing Meadow Park. Always I have problems there. A Puerto Rican man asked me how to get to the Triboro Bridge. When I told him I did not know, he said, "Go to hell!" He also got my smile, but he didn't appreciate it.</p>

<p>I was running near Agni Press when I saw Anupadi. Perhaps she brought me bad luck, because right after I saw her, my hat blew off! Anupadi started laughing, and then some little boys also started laughing. Since everybody was laughing, I also started laughing, very powerfully. When the little boys saw that my laughter was more powerful than theirs, they stopped.</p>
