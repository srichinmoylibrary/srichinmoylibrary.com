<p>Today I lifted up 180 pounds in each arm. There is such a difference between 170 and 180! Our body is a unit, so the whole body has to take an extra 20 pounds. It is not just 10 pounds. The new total is 360 pounds, not 340 pounds.</p>
<p>Soon I shall try 200 pounds and then I will catch all the boys who weigh more than 200 pounds.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Unbelievable things do happen</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Unbelievable things do happen" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I cannot believe it! Unbelievable things do happen. This morning I lifted 200 pounds in each arm simultaneously. First I lifted 200 pounds once with my right arm and once with my left arm. As I was approaching my double-arm lift, I heard R soul screaming, “Where is your belt?” I had forgotten to put on my weightlifting belt and her soul was warning me. It is so dangerous to lift 400 pounds without the belt. R soul came to me like a seven or eight-year old girl and was screaming for me to put on my belt. You can see on the video how I had completely forgotten it.</p>
<p>Today there were two cameras: Dhanu’s automatic one plus a rented one. Before I lifted, I meditated and meditated. Today my meditation was not ending. I was not in this world. I was hearing Lord Krishna playing His flute. He was playing so loudly. Then I saw that my family had all come to watch. My family and R were all wearing white and Lord Krishna was dancing on their heads and playing His flute.</p>
<p>Because I was concentrating so hard, I forgot to turn on the video camera. But then I remembered and turned it on.</p>
<p>On the very first attempt, the two dumbbells went up more than seven inches. My knees were straight. This lift is in no way lower than my 180-pound double-arm lift was. I finished the lift and Dhanu’s camera was still going on. So I had more time. But what more could I do?</p>
<p>I never thought that I would be able to do 400 pounds before April. But God does not believe in the future. He practises His Philosophy in and through me.</p>
<p>As soon as I had finished this lift, my mother said to me in our Chittagong dialect, “My son, God has done many, many important things in and through you and He will do many, many more.”</p>
<p>Then I called my sister Lily. She had a fever and did not want to speak to me at first. But after a few minutes she spoke to me and I told her all about the lift. She was very, very happy.</p>

<p>Today was my rest day. I thought of measuring my arm muscles. My right bicep was 13 3/4 inches and my left bicep was 13 1/2 inches. Poor me! How I wish I could have 15-inch arms! Mine are not even 14 inches.</p>

<p>Today, on my seated double-arm machine, I lifted 150 pounds in each arm simultaneously. At first, the right hand did not go up but then on my second and third attempts it went. Four or five months ago, how much I struggled with this lift. Perhaps the machine is now becoming weaker from wear and tear and that is why I am able to lift up so much weight!</p>

<p>On very rare occasions I invite the disciples to watch when I do my lifting. I prefer to lift in the morning when I am alone. Then I am in my own consciousness. It is just me and my lift. Nobody is there to distract me.</p>

<p>A few days ago I hurt my left knee while I was out walking. I was going along 150th Street and I passed by the bus stop. One lady had missed the bus and she was screaming. I felt such sympathy for her. I turned to look at her and I twisted my left knee. Who knows when and why these things happen!</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, all of a sudden, my calf muscles atrophied. They disappeared. I do not know how I was able to support my bodyweight. They were not painful, but they were very, very weak. I still do not know how it happened.</p>

<p>This evening, when I was lifting 200 pounds with alternate arms, it was as if I were lifting 145 pounds! It was going so high. I shall have to grow taller if I have to lift higher! When you see my arm action, it is like Muhammad Ali’s jab.</p>

<p>Today I lifted my 200 pounds with both arms three times and these lifts are definitely higher than the lift that is being shown on television. First Dhanu did me a favour — his camera did not work — and then Mridanga did me a favour — his video camera ran out of tape. God does not want me to be too proud!</p>

<p>What a stupid thing I have done today! When I was doing the seated double-arm lift, instead of putting the pin at 120 pounds, by mistake I put it at 180 pounds. Can you imagine! The sign said 120 pounds, so I thought that was the weight. I was killing myself but it was not going up. I said, “O my God, today all my strength has gone. Today’s performance is so bad.”</p>
<p>At last I realised what I had done and I changed the pin. How stupid I am! I am an April fool!</p>

<p>Today I did not mean to lift 200 pounds in each arm, but I was tempted! Then I lifted it twice and I was more than satisfied. Nowadays I have to pull down two screen blinds before I lift so that the photo will turn out better. For some reason, the blinds were giving me so much trouble today. As soon as I pulled one down, the other would go up. They did not want to stay down.</p>

<p>Today at the tennis court I practised on twenty different machines. These things I have already done before. I strongly feel that there should be something new to draw public attention. I do not want to do the ones that I have already done. It becomes monotonous.</p>
<p>I thought of lifting up a globe of the world. It could be on top of my lifting machine. Around the globe, three people would be standing holding peace torches. This lift will be so symbolic. Now I shall have to find someone to make it.</p>
