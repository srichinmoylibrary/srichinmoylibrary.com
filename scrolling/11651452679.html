<p><em>(Jesus and his disciples.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: Lazarus, my dear friend, you are no more. O soul of Lazarus, to you I offer my heart’s immense gratitude, for it is you who are helping me reveal the Glory of God. Martha, Mary, dear ones, I am coming to your house to revive your dead brother. Children, let us go to Judea.</p>
<p>DISCIPLES: Judea! What for? Have you forgotten that just the other day they wanted to stone you?</p>
<p>JESUS: Don’t worry. I know who I am. This time they will see my light. My dear friend Lazarus died four days ago. My Father wants me to go to Lazarus and revive him.</p>
<p>DISCIPLES: But by this time he is buried. What can you do now?</p>
<p>JESUS: I can do nothing. I have done nothing. I will be able to do nothing. But my Father did, does and will do everything in and through me.</p>
<p>DISCIPLES: Lord, we give glory to you. You give glory to your Father. You stay with your Father. We stay with you, our Father.</p>
<p>JESUS: Amongst you there are still some who do not believe in me. When I revive Lazarus, their belief will grow. I am grateful to Lazarus. I am grateful to the nonbelievers, for they are helping me to reveal the Lord’s divine Glory on earth. Come, don’t delay. Let us go and bring joy to the bereaved and stricken family.</p>

<p><em>(Jesus on the Mount. He is rapt in trance.Enter Father.The face of Jesus glows.)</em></p>
<p>FATHER: Son, I wish you to offer a series of aphorisms as special advice to your disciples. Your disciples may ask you for their meanings. Therefore I shall tell you the meanings as well, First, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>JESUS: How wonderful is Your advice, Father!</p>
<p>FATHER: It means that the Kingdom of Bliss is for those blessed people who have devoted dedication to their inner and spiritual life and who have nothing to do with pride.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that the true spiritual life of a seeker begins when he has a real sense of loss. His loss is the loss of his inner wealth: peace, joy, love and bliss. This loss creates in him an inner cry which may outwardly be known as mourning. Naturally a seeker of this type will be given back the peace, joy, love and bliss which he is crying to recover.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that if a man has a tremendous sense of superiority, he will lord it over others, but if the same man feels that he is weak and helpless without Me, then he will develop a deep sense of humility. This humility will make him one with all human beings on earth. His universal oneness is the strength that will enable him to claim the earth divinely and supremely.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father,</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that purity alone has the capacity to receive and achieve Divinity. A pure heart is a peerless manifestation of My divine Reality.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You very much, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that My divine children are those who aspire for Light and who are surcharged with Light. Light, in the process of its manifestation, becomes the all-nourishing and all-fulfilling Peace.</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: If any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that forgiveness is by far the best quality both in Me and in all human beings. If ignorance has struck you once and you have forgiven ignorance, there is no guarantee that it will not strike you again. But if you tell ignorance that if it wants to strike you again you are more than prepared to answer it with your forgiveness-weapon, ignorance comes to realise that your weapon is infinitely stronger than its weapon. Your weapon has Light and spreads Light; whereas its weapon, which is darkness, is all confusion. Remaining in utter and constant confusion, how can it continue to fight against its opponent, Light, which is all-loving and all fulfilling?</p>
<p>JESUS: I see. Thank You, Father, thank You. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</p>
<p>JESUS: Wonderful, Father.</p>
<p>FATHER: Son, it means that man gets a great sense of satisfaction if he sees that someone is watching while he is giving something to others. The satisfaction that results from a public show immediately creates unnecessary pride. What is pride, if not immediate and total self-destruction?</p>
<p>JESUS: Thank You, Father, thank You. Next?</p>
<p>FATHER: For today it is enough, My son. I am a bit tired. Some other day I will give you more advice.</p>

<p><em>(Jesus with his disciples.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: I am a Jew, but the Jews do not accept me. They hate me, even though I came to save them. Such is my fate. Yet I know that the whole world will one day accept me, love me and adore me. I know that I am not for a tiny section of humanity only. I am for the whole of humanity. But those who accept me and claim me as their own are undoubtedly my beloved ones. My days are numbered. I have twelve disciples. Among them, Judas will betray me. He will put me into the hands of the enemy. And then they will crucify me.</p>
<p><em>(All the disciples are shocked.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLES: Judas! Judas! Judas will betray our Lord!</p>
<p>JUDAS: impossible, impossible! <em>(Touching Jesus’ feet.)</em> Lord, is there anything that I can do without your knowledge or without your approval or, at least, without your acquiescence? I know, Lord, your words will prove true. But Lord, it seems to me that it is you who have chosen me to play this unthinkable part in your cosmic play.</p>
<p>JESUS <em>(smiles and blesses him)</em>: Judas, you are right. True, the world will hate you. But the world does not know that everything is predestined. So Judas, do your part well when your hour strikes.</p>
<p>DISCIPLES: Lord, our hour has already struck. We want to do our part well.</p>
<p><em>(They all grab Judas and start striking and kicking him.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: Stop! Stop, or I shall leave you all immediately! Judas is doing the right thing. His betrayal is predestined. What can he do now? And what can I do now? Only our Father in Heaven knows what is best for Judas and what is best for me and what is best for all of you.</p>
<p>DISCIPLES: We know what is best for us!</p>
<p><em>(They start striking Judas again.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: Stop! Stop! If not, I shall leave you for good!</p>
<p>PETER: Lord, you are great. You are divine. For you it is easy to forgive a filthy betrayer and a scoundrel like Judas. But we are mortals, ordinary human beings. How can we forgive him?</p>
<p>JESUS: Peter, the same way I shall forgive you. Peter, one day you will deny me — not once, not twice, but thrice. Three successive times in one short day!</p>
<p>PETER: Me? Impossible! When? Why?</p>
<p>JESUS: Yes, Peter, it is you and nobody else who will deny me. You think it is impossible. But I tell you, Peter, it is not only possible; it is inevitable. It is all predestined. Do not cry, do not weep, Peter. I loved you most. I shall always love you most. Again, when the hour strikes, it is you who will carry my banner of Truth and unlock my heart’s door so humanity can see my Father’s Light. You love me most dearly. Therefore I wish you to take care of my other disciples who are my lambs, my sheep.</p>
<p>PETER: Lord, I shall. I shall without fail. Lord, you are the Lord of Love. You are the Lord of Compassion. You are the Lord of Forgiveness,</p>
<p>JESUS: No, no. I am just the son of fulfilment. My Father is the Lord of Love. My Father is the Lord of Compassion, My Father is the Lord of Forgiveness.</p>
<p>PHILIP: Lord, will we ever see your Father?</p>
<p>JESUS: Certainly you can. Philip, shall I tell you the supreme truth? He who has seen me has seen the Father, for I and my Father are one.</p>
<p>Children, I wish to tell you a funny story: There were once three sons of the same father: the youngest, the middle and the eldest.</p>
<p>The youngest son said: “Father is in Heaven.”</p>
<p>The middle son said: “The Kingdom of Heaven is in your heart.”</p>
<p>The eldest son said: “I and my Father are one.”</p>
<p>To the youngest son, the Father said: “Son, thank you for your vision.”</p>
<p>To the middle son, the Father said: “Son, thank you for your mission.”</p>
<p>To the eldest son, the Father said: “Son, thank you for your union.”</p>
<p>My sweet children, Father asked me to go into the world. I obeyed Him. He asked me to show the world His Light. I obeyed Him. I have fulfilled all His demands. He has fulfilled His dreams through my dedicated and surrendered life. Now He wants me to go back to Him. Therefore I am prepared. Children, my Father gave you all to me. Now, at my earthly journey’s close, I am returning you all to Him. I am nothing. He is Everything. He is for everything He is All. He is for all.</p>
<p>Judas, come here, please. <em>(Judas goes and sits at the Master’s feet.)</em> <em>Nimitta matram bhava</em> … Be thou a mere instrument.</p>
<p><em>(Judas sings.)</em></p>

<p>Today, today, today<br /> Alone with God I stay;<br /> Tomorrow and forever<br /> With His Compassion-Ray.</p>

<p>JESUS: Peter, come here, please, <em>(Peter goes and sits at the Master’s feet.)</em> <em>Nimitta matram bhava.</em> Be thou a mere instrument.</p>
<p><em>(Peter sings.)</em></p>

<p>An ant like me to save<br /> You came into this world of dust and clay.<br /> A beggar like me to love<br /> And give me a role sublime in Your Cosmic Play.</p>

<p>JESUS: Children, be the instruments of the Lord. We are all His instruments. Him to embody we came into the world. Him to reveal we came into the world. Him to fulfil we came into the world.</p>

<p><em>(Evening. Jesus alone in a small garden.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: Yes, I have performed miracles and my miracles have been many and varied. I have stilled storms. I have cured physical maladies. I have given sight to the blind. I have even raised the dead to life. But the world will never believe that I consider my miracles to be of secondary importance, to say the least. I came into the world to reveal my Lord, my Father who is in Heaven. If anybody believes in me for my own sake, then he is infinitely greater than those who believe in me only for my miracles. Again, because of the people’s lack of faith, I did not want to perform miracles at Nazareth. It would have served no purpose. To me, each miracle is a manifestation of God’s Power-Light. And if it is not properly accepted it only feeds man’s curiosity; it does not help elevate man’s consciousness at all. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that God’s Power-Light be well regulated by God’s Wisdom-Height. But who will believe that I have the power to perform miracles in the face of all unbelievers, disbelievers and stark atheists? Alas, nobody understands me. Nobody comes to me to fulfil my Lord in His divine Way.</p>
<p><em>(Jesus sings.)</em></p>

<p>None came to me, none came and none shall come.<br /> Only my supreme Beloved came, only He.<br /> I cried for His smile and He, for my selfless love.<br /> Sleepless in me He grows His Vision-Tree.</p>

<p><em>(Jesus and Mary.)</em></p>
<p>JESUS: Mother, please sing me a song, How I wish I could have a singing voice like yours.</p>
<p>MARY: Son, how I wish I could have an illumining heart like yours.</p>
<p>JESUS: Mother, please sing.</p>
<p><em>(Mary sings.)</em></p>

<p>My life began with duty’s pride,<br /> My life shall live with beauty’s light,<br /> My life shall sport with reality’s soul,<br /> My life shall end with Divinity’s Height.</p>

<p>JESUS: Mother, in Heaven I shall miss your stirring voice. In a few days I shall be crucified.</p>
<p>MARY: Oh no, impossible! I shall not allow that to happen. My beloved son, will you not use your divine power to save yourself? Please do it, my son. I shall be so happy, so proud and so grateful.</p>
<p>JESUS: To please you, Mother, I performed my first miracle at the wedding party. I transformed water into wine. To please you again at the end of my journey’s close I shall perform another miracle, the Miracle of miracles. Since my heavenly Father wants me to come back to Him, I shall have to go back. But three days after my death, I shall appear once again and see you all. This miracle will have no parallel in the history of our Lord’s creation.</p>
<p>So, Mother, Mother of my heart, I shall please you in a different way. I shall not save my body, but I shall prove to the world that I am deathless, that I am eternal. Although the body is perishable, the soul is immortal. This body has played its role. Why keep it on earth any longer? Mother, soon you too will join me in Heaven.</p>
<p>MARY: Shall I? How I wish, son, we could go together.</p>
<p>JESUS: Mother, your hour has not yet struck, but soon it will.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Mary Magdalene, weeping.)</em></p>
<p>MAGDALENE: Lord, last night I had a terrible dream, in my dream I saw you being crucified. On the cross you asked for a drink and they gave you some wine. You drank the wine, then bowed your head and said, “It is all finished.” My dream was so vivid. Lord, this dream is ruthlessly tearing at my inner being. My heart is completely broken. Lord, I beg of you, tell me that my dream was all a mental hallucination, with no reality in it.</p>
<p>JESUS: Did you see anything more?</p>
<p>MAGDALENE: Yes, I saw something more. I saw something unbelievable. Three days after your death you appeared before me. I saw you vividly. I ran to tell Peter and your other disciples. Everybody believed me except one disciple.</p>
<p>JESUS: Who was it? Who did not believe you?</p>
<p>MAGDALENE: It was that unfortunate Thomas.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Thomas.)</em></p>
<p>THOMAS: Magdalene, I overheard your conversation with the Lord. I, too, had a similar dream. In my dream I saw something more. The Lord, out of his infinite bounty, made me believe him unmistakably and said, “You believe me because you see me. Happy and fortunate are those who believe me without seeing me.”</p>
<p><em>(Thomas sings.)</em></p>

<p>With doubt my mind began,<br /> With fear my heart began,<br /> With clay my life began,<br /> All in this shortest span.</p>

<p>JESUS: Excellent, excellent, I never knew that you had such a sweet voice. Thomas, your dream has reality in it in great measure. Magdalene, your dream will soon be transformed into reality. Magdalene, please sing me a song. You have not sung for me for a long time.</p>
<p><em>(Magdalene sings.)</em></p>

<p>There was a time when I stumbled and stumbled,<br /> But now I only climb and climb beyond<br /> And far beyond my Goal’s endless Beyond,<br /> And yet my Captain commands: “Go on, go on!”</p>

<p>JESUS: Magdalene, I am well pleased with you. What the Father needs is a heart of purity and you have it in ample measure. A pure heart is a peerless treasure. You heard me saying a few months ago that the pure in heart are blessed, for they will see God. You will see God in me.</p>
<p>MAGDALENE: Lord, I have already seen God in you. Something more, I see you only as God. You are none other than your heavenly Father. You do everything. But you give Him all the credit. Such is your heart’s magnanimity.</p>
<p>JESUS: Dear Magdalene, you are wrong. My heavenly Father is the only doer. I am a mere instrument of His.</p>

<p><em>(Heaven. Krishna is playing on his divine flute.)</em></p>
<p>KRISHNA: Ah, Jesus is singing my favourite song on earth. How soulfully he is offering the wealth of my song to mankind. No, I must be totally frank. That song is not mine. I did not compose that song. It was our Father Supreme who composed that song. He taught me that song and I sang it on earth. He taught Jesus the same song and now he is singing it on earth so soulfully and so fruitfully.</p>
<p>Ah, today our Jesus is coming back home. How hard he has worked, especially his last three years on earth. He needs and deserves some rest here in Heaven. <em>(Shouting aloud.)</em> Rama, Buddha, where are you? Come here please. <em>(Enter Rama and Buddha.)</em> Our brother Jesus is coming back today. Father gave me the message this morning.</p>
<p>RAMA AND BUDDHA: Father always tells you everything first. You are His most favourite son.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Not at all. We all are His most favourite sons. What can poor Father do? Rama, last night you had to put up a brave fight against Satan and the forces of ignorance. Therefore, in the morning you were dead tired. Naturally you had to sleep far into the morning. Father did not want to disturb your sound sleep.</p>
<p>Buddha, you got up very early in the morning and started meditating. You went into your deepest trance. When Father saw you in your usual trance, He did not want to disturb you either. And what was I doing in the morning? I was playing on my flute and reminiscing about my Brindavan <em>lila</em> on earth with my divine Radha and my divine gopis, my totally devoted and completely surrendered devotees. Since I was neither sleeping nor meditating, Father came to me and gave me the message of Jesus’ arrival today.</p>
<p>RAMA AND BUDDHA: Krishna, you are sweetness and concern to all your devotees. To us, your brothers, you are all cleverness and all wisdom. No wonder the world, especially India, has such love for you.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: Brother Rama, Brother Buddha, let us not waste time. Our brother Jesus will soon arrive. His crucifixion has shattered me totally.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: I was simply horrified when I heard about it from Father the other day.</p>
<p>RAMA: When Father told me about Jesus’ crucifixion, I was simply mortified. He has done so much for earth and, in return, earth offers him crucifixion. Earth is not ready for us.</p>
<p>BUDDHA: It seems that earth will never be ready.</p>
<p>KRISHNA: For my sake, for Father’s sake, let us be ready to receive Jesus. Let us make a most beautiful throne for him.</p>
<p><em>(They make a golden throne. Jesus ascends and appears. They greet him most enthusiastically and place him on the throne. Enter Father.)</em></p>
<p>FATHER <em>(blessing and embracing Jesus)</em>: Jesus, my Jesus.</p>

<p>I saw your suffering face.<br />     I cried and cried.<br /> I felt your forgiving heart.<br />     I smiled and smiled.<br /> I clasped your illumining soul.<br />     I danced and danced.</p>

<p>Jesus son of God, avatar of the Western consciousness: Jesus accepted a mortal body so he could reveal man’s immortality. Jesus accepted a man’s consciousness so he could fulfil the divine consciousness. Jesus accepted bodily pain so he could offer the world eternal joy. Jesus accepted betrayal so he could teach the world the meaning of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Jesus, the innocent child, took into his mind the darkness of the world and became Light. Jesus, the loving Son, took into his heart the suffering of the world and became Compassion. Jesus, the all-knowing Father, took upon his body the sins of the world and became Salvation.</p>
<p>Then he offered his human self — the agonised mind, the betrayed heart, the broken body — at the Feet of God. And he offered his divine self — glowing Light, flowing Compassion, the world-Salvation — at the feet of man.</p>
<p>Jesus was the Cross: God’s Revelation and man’s Illumination. Jesus was the Crucifixion: God’s Self-fulfillment and man’s Self-discovery. Jesus was the Ascension: God’s Compassion-Love and man’s perfection-dawn.</p>
