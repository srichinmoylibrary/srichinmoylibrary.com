<p>This morning I went out for a two-mile walk. At my 250-metre mark, all of a sudden Kokila's soul came to me. I said, "I liked your article about my weightlifting so much. I will print it in a pamphlet. Then I will either sell it for 25 cents or give it away free. If I sell it for 25 cents, I will give you all the money." Then I blessed her soul, and the soul went away.</p>
<p>As I came near Main Street on my way back, I saw someone 200 metres ahead of me. I could not see who it was, but I felt a vibration was coming from Kokila's soul. Then, after I turned onto 150th Street, I saw someone about 300 metres ahead of me, and again I felt Kokila's vibration.</p>
<p>When I reached my 250-metre mark, I saw that Kokila had just turned onto the street where she lives and she was waiting there for me. I said, "Kokila!" She turned away her face and started giggling. She would not look at me.</p>
<p>I said, "I liked your article so much. I will print it in a brochure form." Then I told her I had seen her soul at this very spot just a few minutes ago and had blessed it. Again she started giggling.</p>
<p>What can be a greater juicy story? I blessed her soul on my way out, and I saw her on the physical plane on my way back — at exactly the same spot!</p>

<p>When I was walking near my house, two little kids saw me. One of them said, "This is the man!" He meant that I was the one who lived in this house.</p>
<p>The other one said, "No!" So they were having an argument.</p>
<p>Then I said, "Good morning, good morning," and smiled. I made them feel that I was the person who lived here.</p>

<p>Recently when I was at my 1,200-metre mark, I saw X running. The following day, I was walking along the same route, looking at the ground. When I came to that spot, I said to myself, "Yesterday I saw X here."</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes, and whom did I see? It was X again! She was about thirty metres ahead of me.</p>

<p>Another day I saw Namrata running. I said, "O God, Namrata is running so slowly." But after two minutes she was even farther away from me.</p>
<p>Then I saw somebody in front of Namrata. I said, "Somebody is running much faster than Namrata." The person looked like Lavanya, but I said, "She usually does not run at this hour. How can it be Lavanya?" She was far ahead of me, and she turned down a side street, so I did not see who it was.</p>
<p>Then, when I was coming back, I saw that it was Lavanya. I smiled ather and talked to her for a minute. At that hour for Lavanya to run!</p>

<p>When I was at my 1200-metre mark, I saw two runners who looked like circus clowns: Pranika and Dipali. They were wearing tights and hats; they reminded me of circus monkeys.</p>
<p>My outfit was just the opposite: a heavy coat and other warm clothes. It was very cold outside.</p>

<p>Two or three days ago I was coming back from my one-mile walk. Two old ladies were walking side by side ahead of me. They were going so slowly. Finally, one of them turned around and said, "Why do you have to listen to our conversation?"</p>
<p>They thought I was dying to hear their conversation! I wanted to go past them, but they were blocking my path.</p>
<p>A few moments later they stopped at an intersection to wait for the red light to change. I stopped at least thirty metres away from them because I did not want to be insulted again.</p>
<p>When I was in my own meditative consciousness, at that time I had to get their blessings!</p>

<p>Today at my 700-metre mark on 150th Street, two Puerto Rican boys drove by in an old red car. Their hands and heads were sticking out of the car. They were not in a good consciousness.</p>
<p>I was limping, so they shouted, "Look at this sick guy!" They were enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Later, after I had crossed Main Street, again I saw the same car with the same boys. And the same message I got: "Look at this sick guy!"</p>
