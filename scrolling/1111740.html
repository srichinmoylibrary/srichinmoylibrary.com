<p>On the day of the Westchester Half-Marathon, I secretly ran eight and a half miles early in the morning before the race. When I came near the subway station on Queens Boulevard, I saw hundreds of people coming out of a large building. The building had pictures of movie stars on it. I was thinking to myself, "How can they show a movie at five-thirty in the morning?" But you can't drink in a movie theatre and all these people were absolutely drunk. Disciples told me later that it was probably a disco.</p>

<p>It took me almost a minute to get to the starting line of the half-marathon. Often when you start a race, you lose at least one or two minutes at the beginning. Then it is hard to run; there are so many people ahead of you blocking your way. There are always some poor runners who have to run right in front of you. Once I saw X, but I could not go in front of her because there were so many people blocking me. At one point there were three runners running together, and I couldn't pass them.</p>

<p>Previously when I would start a race, hundreds of people used to go ahead of me. I would just run at my own pace and let everyone pass me. Now I can't believe it — when I run, I go ahead of others. That means my speed has increased. So many people I pass — ten here, two or three farther on. In silence I ask them, "What are you doing? You are doing what I used to do-falling back." Those people are having the same experience that I used to have.</p>

<p>At the three-mile point of the half-marathon, Vince was supposed to give me ERG, but he didn't see me run by. I saw him, but I didn't know that he was helping my road crew. Then Lavanya saw him and told him that I was about a hundred metres ahead of her. Vince had to run to catch me. Then, once he caught up with me, he had to run another 100 metres because I still didn't know he was the person meeting me and I kept on going. I thought that he was running to inform somebody else that I was coming.</p>

<p>I would like to have T-shirts with zippers in the front. Then I could change in the middle of a race very quickly. This time, after five miles when I took off my nylon running suit, I felt so cold because my shirt was wet, but I didn't stop to change it. If I could have changed, I would have felt fresher and run faster.</p>

<p>Sometimes I see that after only four miles or so, strong young men start walking. They are very strong and muscular; their chests, arms and legs are so developed. Perhaps they think that their muscular power alone will carry them through the race. But if that were the case, then weight-lifters would all be excellent runners.</p>

<p>In the half-marathon I lost over a minute because of Databir. First I was screaming because he didn't see me. Then, he delayed me because he didn't have the ERG ready for me. He had put the ERG on one side of the road, near his car, and was standing on the other side of the road. He said, "Do you need ERG?" Then he had to run across the street to get it.</p>
<p>When you stop to drink ERG or water, for two hundred metres or so you lose your rhythm and your strides become short. Then you start getting back to your normal pace.</p>

<p>After running five miles in the half-marathon, I was finished; I had absolutely no strength. Then, at nine miles, I got such a painful cramp. By eleven miles my cramps were so painful that I had to walk. I couldn't run 800 metres at a time without walking. I stood on the sidewalk, trying to stretch my legs, but the cramps were so powerful that I couldn't do it. No matter what stretching exercises you take for cramps, they are so painful. What can you do? I had such pain that I could barely stand up. At that time I saw Nemi going ahead of me. I said, "Go!" I had to surrender to her speed.</p>

<p>After about five miles I walked so many times. Before I would start running, I would decide how far I would go before I would start walking again. When I reached that particular place, I would walk for 50 or 100 metres. Afterwards, it came to the point where I was walking 20 metres and running 20 metres. Such pain I had! Two young black boys were joking with me and telling me to run. Of course, they themselves were not running in the race. They were only watching.</p>

<p>When I was dying around eight or nine miles, I saw some new disciples from Connecticut. There were two girls and one boy. They passed me with folded hands. I could see from their faces that they were disciples, but I didn't know their names. Then one girl said, "Guru!"</p>
<p>While I was walking, she went ahead of me 30, 40, 200 metres. She never stopped; she only ran. Then, when I started running again, I caught up with her. Later, when I started walking again, she continued running and passed me.</p>

<p>At one point on the road it said one and a half miles to go. But even before that, people giving water were saying, "Only a mile and a half to go."</p>
<p>Right near the finish of the half-marathon, a man wearing a Citibank T-shirt came up to me and said, "Are you Sri Chinmoy?"</p>
<p>I said I was. Then he said, "Please don't mind if I go a little ahead of you. I won't be able to go very far ahead of you."</p>
<p>I said, "Please go."</p>
<p>He finished not even 50 metres ahead of me.</p>
