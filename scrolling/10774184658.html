<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is no set rule. When I experience God, it can be His personal aspect or it can be His impersonal aspect. Sometimes I see Him, feel Him and divinely enjoy Him as infinite Bliss. Sometimes I see Him and talk to Him the way I talk to an individual; but He appears to me with His divine attributes. He is infinitely more beautiful at that time than the most beautiful child that you have seen on earth. Sometimes He appears in the form of infinite Peace, sometimes as an eternal Child playing inside my heart’s garden. There are many ways that I experience my Beloved Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is not the sole monopoly of an individual or of some selected individuals. If somebody has a sincere inner cry, then sooner or later, at God’s choice Hour, that particular person is bound to realise God and reach the highest Height. God’s Compassion-Light can easily nullify one’s deplorable background. If someone has a sincere inner cry, then definitely he will be able to realise God, no matter what his or her background is, or how much difficulty he has gone through in life before he accepted spirituality. It entirely depends on how sincerely one needs God. If one sincerely needs God, then eventually in one’s spiritual march one will realise God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are experiencing pain, it means that you are trying to pull beyond your capacity. Sometimes when we try to pull something beyond our capacity, we get pain. In the spiritual life, there should be no pulling or pushing, but a natural and spontaneous flow. Meditation should be like a river flowing into the sea. There should be a natural flow — no pulling, no pushing, no coercing, no strenuous effort. Progress should be made in a very natural, spontaneous way. Then there will be no pain in the forehead near the third eye area.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If we invite pain or invoke pain to make us conscious of God’s Reality, then our progress will be very slow. God is all Bliss. He does not want us to cut off our limbs to prove to Him how much we care for Him. He will say, “Children, you are fools. I am all-loving. You should come to Me with all your heart’s love, not through your body’s pain.” God does not want to torture us. It is our own ignorance and wrong forces, and the hostile forces all around us, that like to torture us. In order to reach God, we should not create pain or invite pain. It is through constant love that we should approach God. As a child runs towards his parents — cheerfully and lovingly — even so, each individual seeker should run towards the Eternal Father — cheerfully, lovingly, unreservedly and unconditionally. Deliberate invitation of suffering will be a very long and unhealthy process, and it may lead the seeker very far astray.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Before you meditate, you should concentrate for a few minutes on the Compassion aspect or the Protection aspect of God. Since you experience pain, it is good to invoke God’s Protection-power so that you can continue with your meditation and enjoy the bliss of your meditation. Then God’s inner Forces will protect you, and you can continue your regular meditation as long as you want to.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the beginning it is necessary. When one becomes a very advanced seeker it is not necessary. At that time one can do excellent meditation at any moment — while lying down, while running, while jumping. When one is advanced, one does not have to maintain any particular posture. But in the beginning, it is much better for the proper circulation of the breath to sit with the spine erect. Once your consciousness goes far beyond the domain of the mind, it will not be necessary. Once you can go beyond the confusion of the mental world, you can take any posture. You can meditate anywhere and any way you want to. But, in the beginning, it is really advisable to sit with your spine erect.</p>

I was wondering if you could comment on how a person decides whether to do his sadhana in partnership or alone?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Either the seeker has to dive deep within to get the inner message or ask his spiritual Master to decide on the strength of the Master’s oneness with the Supreme. There is no hard and fast rule that everybody should get married or everybody should not get married. In some cases, the seekers make faster progress if they get married. In some cases, it would be simply impossible for them to make any progress if they got married. Their progress immediately would come to a standstill. It is the soul’s need that the seeker must fulfil.</p>
<p>Sometimes when two people join together, all their capacities are doubled. In the tug-of-war against ignorance, if two persons are pulling together on one side, naturally their strength will be greater than the strength of either one alone. But again, if they are not pulling together, if they are only fighting against each other all the time, then they just destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters, like Sri Ramakrishna, used to advise most seekers not to get married. They felt that if you were not married, you had won half the battle. But again, Sri Ramakrishna’s dearest spiritual son was Brahmananda. When Brahmananda got married, Sri Ramakrishna was quite happy. When his wife had a child, Sri Ramakrishna was extremely happy. But when the child died, Sri Ramakrishna started dancing with joy. He knew that it was necessary for Brahmananda to go through that experience for a few years. But in the case of Vivekananda, his mother and his relatives tried so hard to make him get married, but Sri Ramakrishna stood vehemently against it inwardly and outwardly. Sri Ramakrishna’s two main disciples were Vivekananda and Brahmananda. In one case he approved of marriage, and in one case he stood against it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is fairly easy to know who your Guru is if you are destined to accept spiritual life and a Master. When you go to a shop, there are quite a few things available, and you make your choice. I am a spiritual Master, and there are quite a few other spiritual Masters available. You please visit them. You will find that you have a kind of inner affinity for one particular Master. You can vote inwardly for the Master who gives you the utmost joy, and then accept him as your Master. If you see three or four individuals, give them marks. The one who acquires the highest mark is bound to be your teacher. The marks depend on a kind of inner feeling which is established between the Master and the seeker. You are the only one who is in a position to judge the Masters. The Master who gives you immediate joy or boundless joy is destined to be your Master. It is very easy to know.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This world is the physical world. Inside the physical body is the soul. It is like a bird inside a cage. If the bird is outside the cage, it can fly or do anything it wants to. But when it is inside the cage, very limited scope it has — unless the owner allows the bird to come to the fore, to come outside the cage.</p>
<p>In the soul’s world, the soul can function most powerfully, because there is no obstruction. But here in the physical world there is constant obstruction. Here we are wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance, and the soul has to tolerate it to some extent. The soul does not approve of our shortcomings but, being compassionate, it tolerates them. But when the soul is in its own world, it enjoys freedom. There it does not have to wait for our stupid human life. There it enjoys full freedom.</p>
<p>If we pray and meditate, we can become fully aware of the soul’s divine activities. The more we pray soulfully, the sooner we will become aware of the soul’s divine activities. Only when we become spiritually conscious will we become automatically aware of the soul’s activities in the inner world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If you feel you have a sincere desire, how do you deal with the parts or aspects of yourself that you feel may not be sincere?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If you feel you have a sincere desire, how do you deal with the parts or aspects of yourself that you feel may not be sincere?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A part of your being is sincere and a part is not sincere. From the spiritual point of view, the part that is not co-operating or not siding with the aspiration-life is insincere. You want to get something from the desire-world or in the desire-world. But something is holding you back and telling you that the fulfilment of desire will only take you away from the Peace and Bliss which you are already getting. The sincere part of you wants only God, Truth, Light, Peace and Bliss.</p>
<p>In the desire-world, if you want something, you try to get it with your intense effort. You throw your heart and soul into getting it, as they say. But if something is telling you, “Don’t throw your heart and soul into this. It will only create more problems for you,” then it is the soul that is coming to the fore and pleading with you not to throw yourself into the desire-world. Again, it may happen that although you have desires, sometimes laziness comes in and tells you it is not worthwhile to fulfil them. So you will be the judge. If one moment you have the intense desire to do something and the next moment something tells you it is not worthwhile, that is only your lethargy standing in your way. But if the message comes from the very depth of your heart, from the depth of your being, then you can know that your soul is warning you not to dive into the sea of ignorance.</p>

When you go to the office, when you go to the supermarket, you can carry the Supreme inside your heart and inside your mind. At every moment you can try to manifest the Supreme.</p>
<p>At this moment, by holding meditation I am fulfilling the Supreme. The next moment, by playing tennis I am pleasing the Supreme. Right now I am answering your questions, and half an hour ago we had a very good, soulful meditation. In all these different ways the Supreme is being manifested. You also can manifest the Supreme in many different activities, but you have to surrender to His Will. God wants you, like me, to manifest Him through a life of action. Each time you get a thought, are you offering it to the Supreme? If the answer is yes, then you are doing the right thing. Whether it is a bad, undivine thought or a good, divine thought, if you can offer it to the Supreme, then you are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>For each action there is a thought, there is an idea, there is an ideal. If you are doing it soulfully, devotedly, unreservedly and unconditionally, then you are more than perfect. You don’t have to live in a particular place in order to be spiritual. You have just meditated. That is wonderful. Now, if you have to go to school or to some other place, you can carry with you your spiritual consciousness. Your soulful consciousness you can take into all your outer activities. Otherwise, you may sit in front of your shrine for hours thinking of your friends, your enemies, or things that have happened. You can be closeted alone in your room, but millions of thoughts and ideas will enter into your mind. Nobody is there; you are not talking to anybody, and nobody is talking to you, but you and your mind are constantly talking to each other. That is just a waste of time.</p>
<p>It does not matter where you are, but what you are keeping inside your heart. If you are keeping good thoughts, divine thoughts, illumining thoughts, fulfilling thoughts inside your heart, then you are doing the right thing. If you are carrying me inside your heart as the oneness-representative of God, then you are doing the right thing. You don’t have to go anywhere. While walking, while talking, while eating, while running, while studying, if you can feel God’s Presence, then you are doing absolutely the right thing spiritually. Otherwise, no matter what you do, no matter where you go, you will not be satisfied. Always please try to fulfil the Supreme inside your heart. This is His creation. He has sent all of us to please Him and fulfil Him on earth in His own Way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does intuition come about from having previous incarnations?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does intuition come about from having previous incarnations?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has previous incarnations, but very few people have developed intuition. It is not that. It is something that you have to acquire, either in this incarnation or in a previous incarnation or in a future incarnation. You will not get it because you have had thirty, forty, fifty or one hundred incarnations. It is like a university degree. If I have not studied, no matter how many incarnations I take, I will not automatically get it. Intuition is a subject that you have to study. In one of your incarnations you have to study it well and learn it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: You have told us that the planet Saturn has a powerful relationship with us. Is there also a relationship between us and other planets, or are they just beautiful manifestations of the Supreme’s multiplicity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: You have told us that the planet Saturn has a powerful relationship with us. Is there also a relationship between us and other planets, or are they just beautiful manifestations of the Supreme’s multiplicity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good question. Not only does Saturn have a connection with us; other planets also have a connection. Somebody can be more influenced by one planet than another, but each individual has some connection with the planets. Some souls are very powerful, or very receptive, or very fortunate, and the Supreme is extremely affectionate to those particular souls. So the planets also become more friendly with those souls. It is like pleasing the manager of a factory. If the boss likes someone, then the subordinates all try to be kind and nice to that person. So if the Supreme Boss is pleased with a particular soul, all the planets make it a point to be kind and affectionate and to offer their good qualities to that soul.</p>
<p>Ordinary people will be afraid of Saturn because Saturn represents renunciation. Ordinary householders invoke Saturn so that he will not come to them. They pray to Saturn: “Please do us a favour. Don’t come near us.” But when a spiritual person invokes Saturn, he says, “Please come and give me the message of renunciation. I don’t want to wallow in the pleasures of ignorance any longer. I want only God. I am wearing millions of ignorance garments. Please take them away.” That is the traditional Indian way. We renounce the things that are not essential to our spiritual life, the things that are of no use to us in realising God. We invoke Saturn to take away the things that give us no help, such as earthly desires. At that time, Saturn is a great help to the sincere seeker. But people who want to fulfil their earthly desires ask Saturn not to come to them.</p>
<p>Each soul is connected with some planet, and each planet has some influence on the soul. But it cannot be the same for each person. Sometimes it is very little, sometimes very much. When the seeker becomes spiritually advanced, on the verge of God-realisation, he or she can easily enter into the planet worlds. Some seekers are fortunate because the Absolute Supreme is fond of them. So the planets give them everything in order to make the Absolute Supreme happy. Again, when a seeker is sincerely aspiring and making very good progress, at that time all the planets may come to help him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What causes clothing to be uncomfortable? Sometimes I can’t stand the feel of clothing against my skin.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What causes clothing to be uncomfortable? Sometimes I can’t stand the feel of clothing against my skin." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your clothing may have accepted wrong vibrations from the house or from the atmosphere. Even while you are driving inside your car, it may happen that somebody else throws his wrong vibrations at you. Clothing has a magnetic way of receiving vibrations. You are quite comfortable, but something or someone undivine passes by and his vibration enters into your coat or sari. When wrong vibrations enter into your clothing from anybody undivine, those forces will try to attack you.</p>
<p>Again, if you are in a wrong consciousness, your clothing may be an outer manifestation of the wrong forces inside you. It may happen that others are attacking you, or wrong forces inside you are trying to attack you. The last obstacle for these forces is your clothes. Then you find your clothes uncomfortable. If someone else is attacking you with wrong forces, then clothing is protection for you. The clothing becomes an obstruction to the forces trying to enter into you from the outside. For them it is an obstruction, and for you it is protection. Your clothes take the first attack. So when the first attack comes, please try to be conscious. Let all your inner purity come forward and permeate the length and breadth of your clothes. Then this problem will be solved.</p>
