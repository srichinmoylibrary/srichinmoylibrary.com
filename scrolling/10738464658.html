  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XV: The Supreme Purusha</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XV: The Supreme Purusha" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Chapter XIII has taught us the truth that there is a Field and there is a Knower of that Field. Chapter XIV has thrown abundant light on the Field the cosmic play of Prakriti. In this particular chapter we shall learn about the Knower, the Self Individual, the Self Universal and the Self Supreme.</p>
<p>This chapter begins with a Tree. This Tree is called the World-Tree. Unlike earthly or botanical trees, this Tree has its root above in the Supreme. The Supreme is its only Source. Downward are its branches spread. The Vedas are its leaves. He who has fathomed the depths of the ever-changing and ever-evolving world has all the Vedic Knowledge at his disposal.</p>
<p>Here on earth this Tree is not free. It is caught by its own action and reaction here in this world of ours. It is fondly nourished by the three qualities of Prakriti. If one wants to discover the beginning, the end and the very existence of this Tree, then one has to free himself totally from this Temptation-Tree.</p>
<p>Tree signifies aspiration. This aspiration ultimately rises up to the Highest. Countless are the Indian sadhus (monks) who sit under the trees and enter into the world of deeper meditation. The aspiration of the tree inspires them and arouses their dormant aspiration. Lord Buddha had his Enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi-Tree. The world knows it.</p>
<p>The Gita is an ocean of spirituality. Spirituality’s most affectionate daughter is poetry. The subtle breath of poetry is always fondled by the life-energising spirituality. Let us identify our consciousness with the consciousness of a poet when he speaks of a tree.</p>

<p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br /> But only God can make a tree.</p>
<p>— Joyce Kilmer</p>

<p>Since poetry is my forte, I gladly take the liberty of seeing eye to eye with the blessed poet.</p>
<p>To come back to our philosophical Tree. The wise cut down its root with the axe of detachment. This is the way to liberation. This is the way to the supreme good.</p>
<p>A wise man lives in perfect self-control. He is devoted to the Truth unreservedly and unconditionally. He wants God and God alone, who is the Fount of the world within and the world without, and also of the world beyond. The happenings, encouraging or discouraging, pleasant or unpleasant, divine or undivine do not stir his mind, not to speak of his inner existence. He swims in the sea of fruitful Silence and Equanimity. Being the master of the senses, he lords it over them. He comes to Krishna, his only Haven. No sun, no moon, no fire in His Abode. Not necessary. This Abode is the Source of the entire universe. It is all Illumination. From His eternal Abode there is no return.</p>
<p>It is not for the deluded but for the seers who are endowed with the divine vision to recognise or understand Him, the Lord Supreme, who enters into the body, resides in the body and experiences the qualities of Nature and leaves the body at His chosen hour.</p>
<p>To be sure, all serious efforts of a man will be of no avail until he has achieved steadiness in his mind, until his outer nature is at his command, until his heart overflows with love and devotion to his spiritual Teacher (Guru), until he serves the living Breath of the Lord in humanity.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of creation: the perishable and the imperishable. Beyond these two is the impersonal Supreme. This Impersonal Supreme is at once all-pervading and all-sustaining.</p>
<p>The Lord says: “I, the Purushottama, the Supreme Being, transcend both the perishable and the imperishable.”</p>
<p>There are four Vedas. Strangely enough, all four Vedas significantly speak of this Supreme Being.</p>
<p>The Being Supreme, thousand-headed, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed; He pervades the length and breadth of the earth. He is beyond all ten corners.</p>
<p>Here ‘thousand’ undoubtedly means infinite. Infinity is manifesting itself through the finite in the field of manifestation.</p>
<p>Purushottama is beyond formless and form, beyond impersonality and personality. In Him the mightiest dynamic urge and the profoundest Silence stay together. To Him, they are one. To Him are one heavenly freedom and earthly necessity, the ever-changing form of the earth and the changeless Reality infinite.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XVI: Forces divine and forces undivine</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XVI: Forces divine and forces undivine" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The world, fear and bondage enjoy the deepest intimacy. He who thinks of God is ultimately loved by the world. He who loves God has no fear. Bondage he transcends.</p>
<p>He who feels that sense-pleasure and the supreme joy are one and the same is utterly mistaken. Self-indulgence and the Goal of life never can and never will meet.</p>
<p>To see God one has to be practical, absolutely practical, both in the world of realisation and in the world of manifestation. Nobody can be more practical than one who is endowed with spiritual qualities. His life is guided, protected and illumined by the forces divine.</p>
<p>Fear fears to stay with him who has perfect faith in God. His heart is purity. His mind is freedom. Duplicity? He knows not what it is. His love he uses to love mankind. He expects love in return only if so is the Will of God. His service he offers to the Supreme in humanity, having utterly destroyed the root of expectation-, nay, temptation-tree with the sharp axe of his wisdom-light.</p>
<p>Devotion’s delight and meditation’s silence constantly breathe in him. Violence is too weak to enter into his fort of thought, word and deed.</p>
<p>Purest sincerity he has. Mightiest self-sacrifice he is.</p>
<p>He wears no man-made crown, but a God-made crown which God Himself cherishes. The name of this divine crown is humility.</p>
<p>He who is devoured by the undivine forces is not only unspiritual but impractical in the purest sense of the term. Never can he stay alone even if he wants to. Vanity, anger, ostentation and ego arouse him from his slumber and then they compel him to dance with them. Secretly but speedily ignorance comes in and joins them in their dance, and then cheerfully and triumphantly it teaches them the dance of destruction.</p>
<p>His ego he uses to buy the world. His anger he uses to weaken and punish the world. His vanity and ostentation he uses to win with the world. Consciously he offers himself to the glorification of sense-pleasure. Alas, he himself fails to count his imaginary projects, for they are countless, innumerable. What he has absolutely as his own is his self-praise. What he infallibly is is verily the same.</p>
<p>He says to charity and philanthropy: “Look, I am sending you two to the world. Remember, I am not giving you to the world. Bring back from the world for me name and fame. Come back, soon!”</p>
<p>Charity and philanthropy humbly listen to his command. They go running toward the world. They touch the world. They feed the world. They forget not to bring back name and fame from the world for their master. The master receives his coveted prize: name and fame. Alas, to his utter astonishment, futility follows his name and fame.</p>
<p>His life is the hyphen between sin and hell. What is sin? Sin is the taste of imperfect ignorance. What is hell? Hell is the ruthless torture of unsatisfied desires and the fond embrace of ignorance fulfilled.</p>
<p>At first the seeker has to take ignorance and knowledge separately. Later on he realises that in both ignorance and knowledge THAT exists. Let us kindle our aspiration-flame with the soulful lore of the Isha Upanishad. “Avidya a Mrityum Tirtha....” — "By ignorance he crosses beyond death, by Knowledge, Immortality he enjoys.”</p>
<p>The chapter comes to its close with the word Shastra (scripture). Shastras are not to be ridiculed. Shastras are the outer attainments of the inner experiences and realisations of the Seers of the Truth. Not for those the Goal supreme who look down upon the spiritual experiences and realisations of the Seers of the hoary past. They are committing a Himalayan blunder if they feel, on the strength of their vital impulses, that they can practice meditation and learn the secrets of inner discipline unaided. Personal guidance is imperative.</p>
<p>Easy to say: “I follow my own path.” Easier to deceive oneself. Easiest to starve one’s inner divinity that wants to reveal and manifest itself.</p>
<p>The Teacher enjoins the student: “O my Arjuna, follow the Shastra.”</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XVII: The threefold faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XVII: The threefold faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The outer man is what his inner faith is. All our activities, physical, vital and mental, have a common fount. And the name of that fount is faith. With our faith we can create, control, conquer and transform our fate. To be sure, what unconsciously we call human faith is nothing short of the divine will in us and for us.</p>
<p>What does a Sattvic man do with his luminous faith? He uses his faith to invoke and worship the Supreme. What does a Rajasic man do with his passionate faith? He uses it to us and satisfy the deities. What does a Tamasic man do with his tenebrous faith? He worships the unsatisfied, dissatisfied, hungry, obscure, impure and earth-bound spirits and ghosts.</p>
<p>They say that in the West, food has very little to do with faith. In India the link between food and faith is almost inseparable. Our Upanishadic Seers cried out: “Annam Brahma" — "Food is the Brahman.”</p>
<p>A Sattvic man eats the foods that are fresh, pure and soothing so that he can acquire energy, health, cheerfulness and a long life.</p>
<p>Sour, salty and excessively hot foods are liked by a Rajasic man. Illness captures him. Pain tortures him.</p>
<p>A Tamasic man also has to eat after all. He avidly eats the foods that are stale, tasteless, impure and filthy. The result of his eating can be better felt than described.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Austerity</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Austerity" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Austerity does not mean physical torture, far from it. Mortification of the flesh only a devilish nature can enjoy. God the Merciful does not demand our physical torture. He wants us to have the soulful light of wisdom. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>Austerity means a dedicated body, a pure mind, a loving heart and an awakened soul.</p>
<p>The outer austerity grows on the fertile soil of simplicity, sincerity and purity. The inner austerity grows on the fecund soil of serenity, tranquility and equanimity.</p>
<p>Sattvic austerity wishes no reward. Gain, honour and fame, rajasic austerity expects and demands. Self-immolation or the destruction of others, tamasic austerity wants and cherishes.</p>
<p>A seeker of the transcendental Truth and sex-forces can never run abreast. The seeker walking along the path of self-discovery and God-discovery must know what true celibacy is.</p>
<p>To quote Krishnaprem: “A neurotic celibacy with the so-called unconscious mind full of thwarted sex, issuing in a welter of more or less disguised fantasy, is the very worst condition to be in for one who seeks the inner life. Such a condition may, like extreme bodily weakness, give rise to strange experiences and visions, but it will quite effectively prevent any real treading of the Path. Sex will be transcended; it cannot be suppressed [...] with impunity.”</p>
<p>The chapter ends most soulfully with the Brahman. Brahman is divinely designated by the three soul-stirring words: <em>AUM</em> <em>TAT</em> <em>SAT</em>.</p>
<p><em>AUM</em> is the mystical symbol supreme. <em>AUM</em> is the real name of God. In the cosmic manifestation is <em>AUM</em>. Beyond the manifestation, farthest beyond is <em>AUM</em>.</p>
<p><em>TAT</em> means “That,” the Nameless Eternal. Above all attributes, majestic “That” stands.</p>
<p><em>SAT</em> means Reality, the Truth Infinite.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>AUM</em> and then begin to perform our life’s divine duties.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>TAT</em> and then offer to humanity all our achievements, energising and fulfilling.</p>
<p>We have to chant <em>SAT</em> and then offer to God what we inwardly and outwardly are, our very existence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Chapter XVIII: Abstention and renunciation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Chapter XVIII: Abstention and renunciation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Slowly, steadily and successfully we are now climbing up the last rung of the Gita-Ladder. Here we shall almost have the quintessence of the entire SONG.</p>
<p>Arjuna wishes to learn the nature of abstaining from action and the nature of renouncing the results of action and also the difference between these two.</p>
<p>The Lord tells him that Sannyasa is abstention from the desire-prompted action, Tyaga is the renunciation of the fruits of action.</p>
<p>Sannyasa and Sankhyayoga are identical, while Tyaga and Karmayoga are identical.</p>
<p>To our widest surprise, even now in India there is a blind belief that a realised soul does not work or cannot work or even is not supposed to work on the physical plane. Alas, the poor realised soul has to cut off his existence from the activities of the world! If such is the case, then I believe that self-realisation is nothing short of a severe punishment, an undesirable achievement, loaded with the heavy weight of futile frustration.</p>
<p>To be sure, a realised person is he who has liberated himself from the snares of stark bondage. If he does not work with his body, mind, heart and soul in the world, for the world, and if he does not help the seekers on the Path, then who else is competent to lead the struggling, crying and aspiring humanity to its destined Goal?</p>
<p>For liberation, renunciation is essential. Renunciation does not mean the extinction of the physical body, the senses, and the human consciousness. Renunciation does not mean that one has to be millions of miles away from world activities. Renunciation does not say that the world is the fools’ paradise.</p>
<p>True renunciation not only breathes in this world, but divinely fulfils the life of the world.</p>
<p>The Upanishad has taught us: “Enjoy through renunciation.” Let us try it. Unmistakably we shall succeed.</p>
<p>Right action is good. Desireless action is better. Dedication of the fruits to the Lord is verily the best. This dedication is called the true Tyaga.</p>
<p>Some spiritual teachers hold that action is an unnecessary evil. It leads man to perpetual bondage. So they violently and proudly assert that all action, with no exception, must be ruthlessly shunned. Sri Krishna graciously illumines their folly. He says that Yagna (sacrifice), Dana (self-giving), Tapa (self-discipline) must not be shunned, for Yagna, Dana and Tapa are the true purifiers. Needless to say, even these actions must be performed without the slightest attachment.</p>
<p>Renunciation of duty to humanity is never an act of spiritual realisation or even an act of spiritual awakening. The bliss of freedom is not for him who forsakes duty for fear of bodily displeasure and mental suffering. His false and absurd anticipation will undoubtedly lead him to the world of ignorance, where he will be compelled to dine with fear, anxiety and despair.</p>
<p>He is a man of true renunciation who neither hates a disagreeable action when duty demands it, nor is eager to perform only good and agreeable action.</p>
<p>The Lord says: “To renounce all action completely is not possible for an embodied soul. He who renounces the fruit of action is the true renouncer.”</p>
<p>When desire is totally rejected and personal gain is sincerely not wanted by a seeker, then only perfect freedom shines within and without him.</p>
<p>The Gita is the revelation of spirituality. Sooner or later all must take to spirituality. There need not and cannot be any compulsion. To force others to accept the spiritual life is an act of stupendous ignorance. A real Guru knows that his is not the role of a Commander-in-Chief. He never orders even his dearest disciples. He just awakens and illumines their consciousness so that they can see the truth, feel the truth, follow the truth and finally become the truth.</p>
<p>In numerous ways Sri Krishna has imparted the most inspiring wisdom to Arjuna. At the end he says: “Arjuna, having reflected on wisdom fully, do as you like.”</p>
<p>Something more Sri Krishna has to say: “Arjuna, My supreme word, My inmost secret of all, I tell you. To you I unfold My heart’s secret, for dear to Me you always are. Offer your love to Me. Devote yourself to Me. Bow to Me. Give Me your heart. You will without fail come to Me. This I promise you. Arjuna, you are dear to Me. Surrender all earthly duties to Me. Seek your sole haven in Me. Fear not, grieve not, I shall liberate you from all sins.”</p>
<p>Truth is to be offered only to the earnest seekers. Sri Krishna sweetly cautions Arjuna that the truth that Arjuna has learned from Him is not to be offered to a man with no faith, no devotion, and no self-discipline. No, not for him Sri Krishna’s supreme Truth, whose life is tinged with mockery and blasphemy.</p>
<p>Now Sri Krishna wants to know if Arjuna has understood Him, His revelation. He also wants to know if Arjuna is freed from the grip of delusion and the snares of ignorance.</p>
<p>“Krishna, my sole Saviour, gone is my delusion. Destroyed is my illusion. Wisdom I have received. Thy Grace has done it, Thy Grace supreme. Firmly do I stand freed from doubts. My doubts are no more. I am at Thy command. Thy command I implore. I am ready. I shall act.”</p>
<p>The human soul has gloriously succeeded in emptying all his ignorance-night into the Transcendental Soul of Eternal Light. The Transcendental Soul has triumphantly sung the Song of Infinity, Eternity and Immortality in the aspiring heart of the human consciousness.</p>
<p>Victory, victory to the crying and bleeding heart of the finite. Victory, victory to the Compassion-flood and the Illumination-sky of the Infinite.</p>
<p>Victory of the world within glows! Victory of the world without grows!</p>
<p>Victory achieved. Victory realised. Victory revealed. Victory manifested.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>The King</h2>

<p>God is proud of His Divinity in Sri Krishna. Man is proud of his humanity in Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the beloved Boatman who untiringly plies his Boat of consciousness between India’s unparalleled history and her unrivalled spirituality.</p>
<p>Man’s growing divinity cries for the human perfection in Sri Krishna the man. In Sri Krishna’s humanity lies man’s promise of becoming divine.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna stole the hearts of the Gopis unconditionally. The Gopis stole His Ecstasy unreservedly.</p>
<p>Sweetness and grace inexpressible, bond unbreakable, sacrifice unfathomable — this indeed is Radha, the Mother-Heart of Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Radha carries the human soul into Sri Krishna’s Heart. Sri Krishna transforms the human soul into the Divine Soul and commands it to play its role in the Divine Play.</p>
<p>The influence of the Mahabharata is a flowering of centuries. The influence of Sri Krishna is the Blessing for Eternity.</p>
<p>The Pandavas had love for Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna had not only love but also unstinting concern for the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Arjuna ultimately became the spiritual child of Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna ultimately became the loving slave of Arjuna’s surrender.</p>
<p>The Gita is Sri Krishna’s Heart, his Vision-in-Fulfilment. The Gita is humanity’s Breath, its Journey towards Immortality.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna’s Flute stirs the Universal Consciousness. Sri Krishna’s Gita enchants the Transcendental Consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna plays on His flute. We hear. We do something more. We barter our body’s dust with His Soul’s plenitude.</p>
<p>If the Avatar Sri Krishna is the most complicated Door, then the Gita, His Song, is the most effective Key.</p>
<p>For an earth-bound soul, the Gita can fruitfully reconcile the dark problems of human life. For a Heaven-seeking soul, the Gita can awaken a new consciousness of ever-increasing Bliss.</p>
<p>I do. I refuse to accept the invitation of Desire. Sri Krishna does. He comes in to illuminate my consciousness.</p>
<p>My ideal is to mount higher and higher up the ladder of divine evolution. Sri Krishna’s Ideal is to make of Himself the divine Sacrifice to strengthen the rungs of the ladder.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is sweet when I realise Him in the perfection of my “I". Sri Krishna is sweeter when I realise Him as the Doer. Sri Krishna is sweetest when I realise Him as the Pilot of all my actions and myself as His dedicated instrument.</p>
<p>An aspirant’s is the cry that compels Sri Krishna to seize him with the very madness of love.</p>
<p>A Vaishnava’s life is love-intoxicated. He is a portion of Sri Krishna’s individuality, perpetuating all the divine qualities of an everlasting Life.</p>
<p>When I live in Sri Krishna’s Soul, I see the Truth from above. When I live in Sri Krishna’s Heart, I see the Truth from within. When I live in Sri Krishna’s Body, I see the Truth from without.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna is the shoreless ocean of Bliss. But as soon as I sincerely dedicate myself to Him, He presents me with His own Boat and takes me to the boundless Shore, the Golden All.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna walked the soil to annihilate the philosophies of world-shunning spirituality and of world-grasping materialism. He established on earth the “Dharmarajya,” the Kingdom of the Inner Law. He restored the true spirit of Kshatriya heroism, motivated not by human ego, but by Divine Will, making man a devoted and active instrument of the Supreme. He brought down to the earth-consciousness the supreme Truth that earth and earthly life, being inherently divine, must be made outwardly divine, fully and totally, in every sphere, in every aspect.</p>

<p>When “I go to the Buddha for refuge,” He blesses me.</p>
<p>When “I go to the Inner Law for refuge,” He illumines me.</p>
<p>When “I go to the Order for refuge,” He utilises me.</p>
<p>Siddhartha did. He flew from His household life into the state of homelessness. The Supreme did. He placed the Buddha in the adoring heart of humanity, in the lap of universal love.</p>
<p>Temptation He saw and shunned. Austerity He felt and lived. The Middle Path He realised and offered.</p>
<p>The Omnipotent did two things. Through Siddhartha Gautama, He revealed the ideal of perfection in a human being. Through the Buddha, He revealed His Enlightenment and Compassion in a Divine Being.</p>
<p>The Buddha cast aside caste. He taught. The fallen learned from Him the value of self-respect. The unbending learned from Him the necessity of humility.</p>
<p>Nirvana is a miraculous power. Negatively it pleases the souls who want ‘Extinction’. Positively it pleases the souls who long for the Ultimate and Transcendental Bliss.</p>
<p>The Buddha stood not against the Hindu religion. He stood against the Hindu perversions and corruptions. He was never ashamed of the Hindu religion. But He was utterly ashamed of some of its ways and methods.</p>
<p>The Buddha had no God. But He had Divinity in its fullest measure.</p>
<p>With His Heart the Unfathomable came to the Buddha.</p>
<p>With His Mind the Unknowable came to the Buddha.</p>
<p>With His Bliss the Transcendental came to the Buddha.</p>
<p>Hinduism is the Tree. Buddhism is its largest branch. The Son discovered that His Mother was not perfect. So He decided to live all alone.</p>
<p>Buddhism gave birth to two schools of thought: Hinayana and Mahayana. Hinayana or Theravada depends on self-reliance. Mahayana depends on Grace.</p>
<p>Hinayana longs for individual salvation. Mahayana longs for collective salvation.</p>
<p>Hinayana feels that the monks alone are entitled to pray for the Ultimate Truth. Mahayana feels that not only the monks but also the laymen are entitled to pray for the Ultimate Truth.</p>
<p>Meditation gives Enlightenment, feels a Hinayanist. Meditation, Prayer and Invocation, all these give Enlightenment, feels a Mahayanist.</p>
<p>A Hinayanist sits at the feet of Buddha’s Teachings, following the advice that one must work out one’s own salvation.</p>
<p>A Mahayanist sits at the feet of Buddha’s earthly Personality, following the advice that one should not cross the Gate of Transcendental Bliss until each and every soul has been liberated.</p>
<p>True, Buddhism is no longer alive in the land of its birth. But Mother India is abundantly proud of her spiritual Prince and she ever cherishes her world-illumining Teacher. Her fondest feeling is: My Buddha is a rebel child. My Buddha is a great Contributor. My Buddha is a great Reformer.</p>

<p>Jesus came. The world heard. Jesus went. The world saw. Jesus smiles. The world becomes.</p>
<p>Jesus wanted. The world gave not. The world wanted. Jesus gave. In addition, He became.</p>
<p>Jesus had the chance to tell the world the matchless virtue of Forgiveness. Jesus did not have the chance to tell the world the unavoidable necessity of the Sword.</p>
<p>Jesus’ human birth was the Question. His Divine Death was not only an Answer, but The Answer.</p>
<p>God was more than successful in sending down His Son to the earth. Humanity suffered worse than Defeat in not receiving the Son.</p>
<p>Jesus had. The world needed. The world had. Jesus accepted.</p>
<p>Jesus did. He unveiled Himself. The world did. It veiled Itself.</p>
<p>God smiled through Jesus’ eyes. Humanity cried through Jesus’ eyes.</p>
<p>Jesus was Mary’s earthly creation. Mary was His spiritual creation. She protected the Plant. The tree sheltered her. And she within herself shelters His Father’s entire creation.</p>
<p>Sensuality cannot live in Purity. But Purity can live in sensuality. Mary’s Purity touches not only the ceaseless flow of human impurity, but also its fount: Ignorance.</p>
<p>Human impurity knows only how to cry out. Mary’s divine Purity certainly listens to its cry. But her dynamic wand must wait for the Hour of God. Furthermore, the receptivity of every individual is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Jesus’ body showed the earth how to use. Jesus’ soul showed the Heavens how to descend.</p>
<p>Earth’s blunders are great. God’s Compassion is greater. Jesus knew it. He prayed for this blessing: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”</p>
<p>God is both Reason and Faith. Protestantism wants to see God through His immaculate Reason. Catholicism wants to see God through His implicit Faith.</p>
<p>Catholicism feels that Christ eternally Was. Protestantism feels that Christ gradually Became.</p>
<p>Who is our peerless friend? One who consciously or unconsciously helps us to fulfil God’s Will within and without. Jesus knew it. “Friend,” He addressed Judas. The significance of Judas’ kiss Heaven knew, but the earth has yet to know.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III: Stories from the Gita</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III: Stories from the Gita" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>The Source</h2>

<p>We all know that the Gita comes from the Mahabharata, India’s greatest epic. There was a great sage named Vyasa. His father’s name was Parasara. Once, the sage Vyasa was deeply inspired to write an epic, but he found that it was impossible for him to write down the whole epic. So he prayed to Brahma, the Creator.</p>
<p>Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, our Trinity: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, Shiva the Transformer. Vyasa prayed to Brahma and Brahma descended in human form. The sage said to Brahma, “Please send me someone who can write down what I say.” Brahma said, “Well, there is only one person on earth who can do that, and that is Ganapati. You invoke him, he can take down your dictation.” So he invoked Ganapati, the son of Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>Ganapati came and agreed to write on one condition. The condition was that Vyasa could not pause; he had to dictate continuously, without interruption. If he hesitated or if he paused, then Ganapati would leave him. Vyasa consented and said, “Now, I also want to dictate to you on one condition, and that condition is, that unless and until you know the meaning of what I dictate you will not write. You have to wait and ask me if there is anything that you do not comprehend.” Vyasa was very clever. He thought that he would use complex sentences and it would take time for Ganapati to understand them, and in the meantime he would be able to get more inspiration and get ready for dictation. Thus the Mahabharata was composed.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Krishna, I need only You</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Krishna, I need only You" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When Sri Krishna was having his siesta, both Duryodhana and Arjuna came to his place. Duryodhana came a few minutes earlier and, as he was full of pride, he stood beside Sri Krishna’s head. Arjuna, as he was full of humility and modesty, stood beside Sri Krishna’s feet.</p>
<p>After a while, Sri Krishna woke up and his eyes fell on Arjuna. When he turned around he saw Duryodhana. He wanted to know why they were there at that hour. Arjuna said, “Now you know that the battle will take place. I need you.”</p>
<p>Duryodhana said, “I have also come here to take help from you, and I have come before him so you have to fulfil my desire first.” So Sri Krishna said, “It is true that you came before Arjuna, but I saw him first, and he will I be given the first chance. Besides, he is younger than you. So he will have the first choice.</p>
<p>Arjuna said to Krishna with great joy. “I want you!”</p>
<p>Duryodhana thought: What a stupid fellow Arjuna is. He wants Krishna alone.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna said, “You want me? But I will not fight. I will only be your charioteer. One of you will have me alone and the other will have my vast army.”</p>
<p>Duryodhana felt, what could Krishna do alone and unarmed? The best thing for him was to have Krishna’s army.</p>
<p>But Arjuna, being an illumined person, said to himself, “What shall I do with his army? The best thing is to have the Lord with me. The Lord will be able to protect me and the Lord will bring me the victory.” Arjuna wanted Sri Krishna and Duryodhana wanted the entire army of Sri Krishna.</p>
<p>Now the promise was that Sri Krishna would never, never fight. Unfortunately, he had to break his promise; he could not keep it. Twice he ran out of the chariot. To kill whom? Bhishma. On the third and the ninth day Sri Krishna found that Arjuna was not fighting properly against his grandsire. Arjuna found it extremely difficult to use weapons against his grandsire.</p>
<p>Sri Krishna said, “Arjuna, you are not fighting. Why?” So he came out of the chariot with his discus. He wanted to kill Bhishma. And what was Bhishma’s reaction? Bhishma’s joy knew no bounds. He said, “Come, O my Lord, come! If I die in your hands then immediately I will go to heaven! I am the most blessed person because you are coming to kill me!”</p>
<p>But, both times, Arjuna followed Sri Krishna and said “No, you have to keep your promise. I won’t let you fight, I shall fight. I won’t allow you to eat your words. You come, you sit in the chariot and drive me on. I shall fight.</p>
<p>Here we learn that the Guru, the Master, can at any moment break his own promise in order to help, to save, in order to win a victory for the disciple. Sri Krishna was the Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and also the Just. But when the question concerns a most intimate disciple, the Guru goes against the ordinary light of morality. This was Sri Krishna’s heart for Arjuna.</p>

<p>Gandhari’s eldest son, Duryodhana, came to her for benediction. She did not say, “I pray for your victory!” or “Yours will be the victory!” She said, “Where there is Dharma, victory will be there.” She knew perfectly well that on the other side, in the other party, was Yudhishthira, the Son of Dharma, Dharma incarnate, who would win the victory. She could not bless her son saying, “Yours will be the victory.” So she said, “Where there is Dharma, there will be the victory.”</p>

<p>There are seven hundred verses in the Gita. I had the good fortune to see a man in India who recited the whole of the Gita in an hour and a half, from the beginning to the end. And he said to me that previously he could do it in an hour. However, reciting is one thing, repeating is one thing, but following the teachings of the Gita is something else. The man who recited the whole of the Gita by heart perhaps did not follow any of the teachings of the Gita. In the third chapter of the Gita we come to know that too much eating is not good. It is better to have fresh and not stale food. But this man was a voracious eater and he used to eat rotten, spoiled food. So, he read the Gita but he did not follow the Gita.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Krishna, the eternal mystery</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Krishna, the eternal mystery" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Sri Krishna was a teacher from the very beginning of his life. Even before he entered into the physical world he acted as a teacher. Before he entered into his mother’s womb, he came to his father who had been imprisoned by the king and said, “I am now going to enter into the physical world. As soon as I am born, you will take me out of this prison-cell and take me to Nanda” (one of his relatives). His father saw Sri Krishna vividly before he came into the world of manifestation, and to everybody’s surprise, all of a sudden all the doors and gates of the prison were wide open, and his father took him to Nanda’s place. Here he started his teaching.</p>
<p>Before he came into the world, a similar incident occurred to the mother of the Lord Buddha. Also Christianity practically says the same, that Jesus entered into his mother’s womb consciously.</p>
<p>To come back to Sri Krishna, while he was just a child he opened his mouth and showed his mother the whole universe. He was teaching his mother that the universe is nowhere else but inside him.</p>
<p>Then, when he was eleven years old, one day he observed that his parents and his relatives and neighbours were all performing ceremonies in honour of the Lord Indra, Indra the rain God, King of the Gods. Sri Krishna said, “Why are you worshipping Indra? It is better to worship this hill. Why don’t you worship this Giri Govardhan? Our cattle are being fed by this hill, and everyone is being helped in one way or another by this hill. We should worship the hill and not Indra. Indra is not helping us in any way. If you want to know the truth, then you worship this hill.” They listened to him on that occasion. They worshipped not Indra but the hill, and Indra became furious. He inundated the whole place with water. There was a constant downpour which lasted seven days. But Sri Krishna was not to accept defeat. With one of his fingers he lifted the whole hill, and the hill served the purpose of an umbrella. The entire vicinity was under the protection of the hill, and it is still there. It is said that Sri Krishna held it for seven days and then Lord Indra felt that it was useless. Sri Krishna protected his whole race and all his relatives. Then Lord Indra accepted his defeat.</p>
<p>Krishna was a cowherd and he had many, many friends. He was a very great flutist. The boys and girls, especially the girls, used to come to listen to his music. But the love he had for them was always of the purest. He had many so-called girlfriends. We immediately associate this term with the wrong emotion, but in Sri Krishna’s case, his relationship was absolutely pure. Among these girls, there was one called Radha. Radha finally became his consort and his shakti, and it was she who understood fully who Sri Krishna was. There Sri Krishna was expressing his Divine Love to human beings. It was delight that he wanted to express, pure delight, to this physical world. But criticism was existent in those days too. People started criticising Sri Krishna openly because of his fondness for Radha. Radha became very close to him. One day, Radha, in a sulking mood, said to him, “Look, you are so pure and so divine and I come here to listen to your music and you tell me eternal, divine truths. How is it that people create such gossip, especially my girlfriends? Just because you give special attention to me they criticise us.” Sri Krishna gave her a broad smile and said, “All right.” So one day Sri Krishna invited all his girlfriends and told them, “Today I wish to have a special game. I know all of you are pure and all of you are chaste. Most of you have husbands.” Then Sri Krishna took a sieve and a bucket of water. He told them each to pour the water into the sieve, and if the water did not leak through, it meant that that particular girl was pure and chaste. They started, one by one, to pour water, and of course with the first one the water leaked through. They all were laughing and saying that she was not chaste or pure, and she buried her head in the fold of her arm. Then the next girl came and the same thing happened, and on and on with each girl.</p>
<p>Radha was observing the scene. Sri Krishna said to her, “Radha, why are you silent, why don’t you try?” She said, “They are always criticising me, and if I try I will probably join them in their failure.” Sri Krishna said, “Why don’t you come and try, it is a game after all.” So she came and poured the water, bucket after bucket, but the sieve did not leak. They were all astonished and Sri Krishna said, “Look here, now you can see who is chaste, who is pure. Now I am teaching you the eternal truth. I am the Lord of the Universe. Radha comes to Me for spiritual help and Eternal Truth, and My love for her and all of you is spiritual and divine. Some of you have husbands, but your minds still roam elsewhere. You care for other men and you give much attention to name, fame and duties. But in Radha’s case, I am always in her mind. Radha is a married woman, Radha has her own husband, but no matter where she goes and with whom she speaks, her mind is always on Me. I am the Lord of the Universe, and whoever thinks of Me is the purest on earth. Those who think of other things are not pure.”</p>
<p>When he grew up in the society very often he wished to give most illumining counsel. Everybody came to him for guidance, and he was their chief counsellor. When the Pandavas became his most intimate friends, he used to advise them all the time in their difficulties; in all their sorrows and joys Sri Krishna was there to advise them. Then he came to the battlefield to help Arjuna. We already know from the Gita how he advised Arjuna to fight, and he taught Arjuna all about the inner life, the spiritual life, inner perfection and outer perfection, realisation and revelation. Sri Krishna said, “Whenever there is decline of righteousness, and unrighteousness is in the ascendent, then I body Myself forth to protect the virtuous and put an end to evil-doers; to establish Dharma, I am born from age to age.” This is one of the most important verses in the Gita.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Arjuna and the ascetic</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Arjuna and the ascetic" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Arjuna happened to be a rajasic warrior. He wished to fight and kill people. In the Mahabharata we saw how he fought against the enemy. Krishna wanted to smash Arjuna’s rajasic pride because Arjuna was very dear among Krishna’s friends and disciples. Once pride entered into Arjuna, and Sri Krishna said, “Let us go for a walk.” Both of them went out for a walk, and on the way they saw an ascetic who was eating a tiny blade of dry grass. Green grass was all around and available to him, but he was picking up dry grass. At the same time, a naked sword was dangling at his side. Arjuna could not comprehend. On the one hand he was not eating even green grass that has life because he would not harm or injure any living thing. Such was his compassion for living things that he was ready to eat dry grass, but not green grass. Yet at the same time, there was his sword at his side. So Arjuna asked Sri Krishna, “Please tell me what is wrong with this fellow. Why is his life a life of contradiction with a blade of grass and at the same time a naked sword?” Sri Krishna said, “You go and ask him.” So he went and asked the ascetic, “Please tell me. I do not understand why you act this way. ” The man answered, “You are right that I want to lead a pious life, I do not want to injure. But at the same time, I want to kill four persons on earth and for that I have kept this sword. Four persons, the moment I see them, I will kill them.” Arjuna said, “Please let me know who they are.”</p>
<p>“The first is Narada.”</p>
<p>“What has Narada done to you?”</p>
<p>“Oh Narada! All the time he sings the glories of my Lord Krishna. There is no time for my Lord to take his rest. All the time he has to sing, and I hear the songs — singing, singing, singing. He always disturbs my Lord’s sleep. I want to kill this wretched Narada if I see him.”</p>
<p>“Then who is the second person?”</p>
<p>“The second is Draupadi, Arjuna’s wife. All of a sudden, she spoke, ‘Lord, save me, save me!’ My Lord had to go and apply his force in order to save her modesty. What kind of audacity she had!”</p>
<p>The story of Draupadi is that when Yudhishthira lost to Duhshasana, Duryodhana’s younger brother, in a dice game, the last promise he gave was that Draupadi would be given to the winner. So, as he lost again, Draupadi, the wife, had to go to the other side and stay with the Kauravas. They wanted to undress Draupadi and do such an unthinkable thing in front of kings and potentates. Draupadi, in the beginning, tried to hold fast to her clothes, but finally she surrendered and said, “Oh Krishna, save me!” Immediately Krishna granted her an endless stretch of garments. They went on pulling her dress off, but it was endless, so it was useless for them to continue.</p>
<p>When the Pandava family was in the forest, it happened that the sage Durvasa came to their place with all of his followers and disciples. The enemies of the Pandavas had sent Durvasa to pronounce a curse on the Pandavas. Durvasa had once gone to the Kauravas and had been very nicely welcomed, given princely honour by the eldest of the Kauravas, Duryodhana. Since he was highly pleased with Duryodhana, Durvasa said, “Now ask me for any boon.” At this time, Duryodhana asked him to go to the forest where the Pandavas were. Sri Krishna had given the Pandavas a pot out of which any number of people might be fed. However, they would be able to do so only before Draupadi had taken her last meal of the day. After Draupadi had eaten, the Pandavas would not be able to feed a single person on earth. Duryodhana asked Durvasa to go there one day after Draupadi had eaten, after she had finished her meal. Durvasa listened to Duryodhana’s prayer. He came after Draupadi had finished her meal only to torture her. In those days, when a spiritual master came, the first thing was to feed him. If you did not feed Durvasa, he would curse you and turn you into ashes. When Durvasa and his followers came in, poor Draupadi had no food left. Durvasa came in and said, “I am very hungry.”</p>
<p>She knew that if she did not feed him, he would curse her and her husband. So she invoked Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna was at that time seated on his throne. He was nowhere near the forest, but he immediately saw with his occult vision, and he came physically to save her. Sri Krishna said, “Please give me something to eat. I am very hungry.” Draupadi answered, “You are so hungry, and here I am, embarrassed. I have invoked you to help me, and you come here to torture me. How am I to give you food?” He said, “No, you have to give me food. Examine your pot.” She replied, “There is nothing left. I am not telling you a lie. I have washed it. I have eaten. We have all eaten. There is nothing left. I can show it to you.” So she brought the pot, and he discovered that there was a grain of rice remaining. He ate it and said, “Now, I am satisfied. Now you ask me anything. I am pleased with you.” She said, “Save me! The sage Durvasa has gone now, with his thousands of disciples, to bathe in the Ganges. When he comes back he will want food.” So Krishna, with his spiritual power, immediately made ready food for thousands of people. Now Durvasa with his Yogic vision came to know that Sri Krishna had already arrived. He said, “It is useless for me to go there, because now they will be able to feed me. I don’t want to go there. I am satisfied.”</p>
<p>To come back to the story of Arjuna and the ascetic, the ascetic said, “I want to kill Draupadi. In season and out of season she asks for my sweet Lord’s help. I will kill her. She should not invoke my Lord at any time.</p>
<p>“The third person is Prahlada. He was one of the greatest disciples of Sri Krishna. But his father used to hate Sri Krishna. The very name of Sri Krishna used to irritate him. His son was just the opposite, constantly following Krishna. So what did his father do? He threw Prahlada into a boiling tub of oil. Then he threw him on the ground and he placed him, his own son, under a mad elephant. He let the elephant crush the son because the son was not listening to his father. But the son was not crushed and the burning oil did not kill the boy. Sri Krishna was there. So, while the father wanted to kill the boy, Sri Krishna’s presence saved him.”</p>
<p>That is why the ascetic said, “Whenever there is any danger, immediately Prahlada speaks the name of my Lord Krishna, who goes to save him. Prahlada has no right to invoke my Lord. He has to be punished.</p>
<p>“The fourth one is the wretched Arjuna,” the ascetic went on. “I want to kill him here and now.”</p>
<p>Arjuna said, “Arjuna! What has he done?”</p>
<p>The ascetic replied, “Look at his audacity. He asked my Lord Krishna to be his charioteer on the battlefield. Sri Krishna is the Lord of the Universe, and Arjuna asked him to be his charioteer. Look at his audacity! I want to kill him.”</p>
<p>Arjuna came to realise that the ascetic was really devoted to Sri Krishna, and that he was all love and concern for Him.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">A great hero and the result of his one single lie</h2><span property="dc:title" content="A great hero and the result of his one single lie" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I wish to tell you a sad story. Durvasa thought that he had conquered everything. He said: “I have conquered anger, I have conquered passion, I have conquered everything. There is nothing left for me to conquer.</p>
<p>Then one day, when he was meditating, a fly came and sat on his shoulder. Durvasa flew into a rage. He, who was so powerful, became very angry with the fly and said: “I have the power to destroy the world. How dare you sit on my shoulder!”</p>
<p>The fly flew away and took the help of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva came to him and said, “Durvasa, you have conquered everything, yet a fly can sit on your shoulder and you become angry!”</p>
<p>Durvasa was most powerful. He had spiritual power and occult power, but he had never conquered his anger. In the Mahabharata there are many authentic stories of his cursing people in season and out of season. His blessings, too, were very irrational. At times he used to bless people, but very often it was more of curse. His very blessing was a curse.</p>
<p>Now the mother of the great hero of the Gita, Arjuna, was Kunti. Kunti came of a royal family and when she was young and unmarried, a virgin, it happened that Durvasa came to her father’s palace and she served him. Durvasa was so pleased with her that he immediately said: “I shall grant you a boon.”</p>
<p>She said, “Thank you. I will be so happy.”</p>
<p>“All right. The boon is that soon you will be the mother of a great hero.” This was the blessing! Kunti was unmarried, and this was his boon!</p>
<p>She said, “Now I am unmarried, how can I become the mother of someone?”</p>
<p>But poor Kunti had a child. As it was illegitimate, she placed the child into a casket and threw it into a river. The river flowed by and took the baby into the hands of an ordinary, common person, a charioteer named Adhirat. Adhirat brought up the child, Karna. He grew up to be the great Karna, as powerful as Arjuna. Finally Arjuna and Karna had to fight against each other on the battlefield of Kurukshetra.</p>
<p>Karna was one of the greatest heroes in those days but he did not know who his mother was. When the battle of Kurukshetra was taking place, Kunti came to him at the last moment crying: “My son, you are fighting against another of my sons. I want both you and Arjuna as well as my other sons to stay together.”</p>
<p>Karna said, “Now it is too late. I cannot do that. You have five sons and, if you consider me as your sixth son, then I tell you that when the battle is over you will have your five sons.”</p>
<p>“How?” she cried.</p>
<p>“Either Arjuna will kill me, or I shall kill Arjuna. I will not touch the rest of the brothers. The world knows that you have five sons and you will keep your five sons.”</p>
<p>We know that in the Kurukshetra war Karna was killed by Arjuna. He was killed because he once told a lie about his caste. Adhirat, who brought him up, was not a Kshatriya (warrior), so Karna was not considered to be of Kshatriya origin. For this reason the great archers and others did not want to teach him. They said, “You do not come from a Kshatriya family. We cannot teach you. You come from a low caste.”</p>
<p>Finally he went to Parashuram, one of India’s greatest archers and, when Parashuram asked him his caste, he said: “I come from a Kshatriya family.”</p>
<p>Parashuram believed him and taught him archery, so Karna became a great warrior. Then it happened that one afternoon, while Parashuram was taking a siesta with his head resting on Karna’s lap, Karna was stung by a scorpion. Karna’s whole thigh began to bleed profusely but he thought that, as his master was fast asleep, he would wake him if he made a noise. So he kept quiet and he didn’t kill the scorpion. After a while his master awoke and saw the situation.</p>
<p>He said, “You didn’t kill the scorpion. You have told me a lie! A Kshatriya cannot tolerate this kind of thing. Your thigh is bleeding profusely and, if you were a Kshatriya, you would have killed the scorpion immediately. But you are not a Kshatriya. You come of the Sudra caste. You are a man of service. You can never be a Kshatriya, you can never be a warrior. You have told me a lie. At the time of your need, your deepest need, you will forget the secret of applying your greatest weapon.”</p>
<p>Now we see how this happened in the Battle of Kurukshetra when Karna was fighting against Arjuna. Karna had the most powerful weapon which nobody on earth could overcome. He thought that he would utilise it only against Arjuna in the battlefield and not against anybody else. He said: “I shall use this weapon only against Arjuna.”</p>
<p>But in the battlefield, Ghatothkach, a son of Bhima, Arjuna’s brother, was killing hundreds of warriors on Karna’s side. He started coming closer to Karna and, when he was about to kill Karna, Karna said: “Now I have this powerful weapon given to me by Parashuram. With this I can kill anybody on earth. Why do I not use it?” So he used it and he killed Bhima’s son. Then when he came to fight Arjuna he was powerless and was killed by Arjuna. You see how Parashuram’s prophecy came true. You also see how Karna’s prophecy came true. Five sons of Kunti remained alive.</p>
