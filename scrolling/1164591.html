<h2>Question: There isn't such a great role in the West of non-verbal communication. How do you deal with people who are used to a different kind of communication?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say that when someone comes to me with a sincere and aspiring heart, I can work most speedily and most convincingly through my inner silence. I hold meditations several nights a week, and I have quite a few Centres. Physically I may not be with my disciples, but spiritually I can guide them with my inner silence. This inner guidance is much more effective than outer guidance and outer talk. I can speak to you for hours and hours, but rest assured that if I meditate with you or on you for just a couple of minutes, it will elevate your consciousness and height. When I am talking, your physical mind is sometimes accepting what I am saying and sometimes it is not. The mind is like that. The physical mind, the mind which is in the physical, always wants to accept the truth in its own way; therefore it has tremendous limitation. At one moment, when it is accepting me, it thinks that I am a very great man, a very good man, a nice man and a kind man. But the next moment it wants to reject my thoughts, my ideas, my suggestions, my light, and it will immediately say, "He is very bad." And then, a moment later, what will happen? It will suspect or doubt its own judgement. It will say, "Am I correct in my assessment of this man?" Then where do you stand? First you judge me as a good person, then you judge me as a bad person, then you judge yourself in order to see whether your judgement is correct or not. Now who becomes the loser? Unfortunately you become the loser when you try to judge yourself. With your judgement of me, whether it is wrong or right, you can have some confidence. You have come to assess me and you know that I am a bad man or I am a good man. But when you try to judge yourself, whether you are right or wrong, you are totally lost.</p>
<p>Again, from the spiritual point of view, when you start judging yourself, that means that some humility has dawned, some sincerity has dawned, some inner awakening has taken place. That is why you are judging your own judgement. You try to go to a higher authority and that higher authority is deep inside you. When you get the message from the higher authority, you come to realise that this man who says that he can offer guidance through silence is saying the right thing.</p>
<p>I have given talks at hundreds of universities, and I wish to say that I have inspired and awakened the consciousness of many seekers. According to their capacity and understanding, they have accepted the divine inspiration that I have offered to them. Now recently I have started offering my inspiration and aspiration through silence. I shall be holding meditations at various places. I will bring down Peace, Light and Bliss from above only through inner silence and inner communication, and seekers will receive it according to their own receptivity and capacity.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, and in our path especially, we always try to identify ourselves and to feel our inseparable oneness with the vast. That is what the heart can do. The mind cannot do this. Suppose the mind is right in front of the vast. It will take a portion of the vast and it won't be satisfied. It will try to scrutinise it, to see if there is any hole or imperfection in it. But the heart will not do that. Even if the heart sees imperfection, the heart will take this imperfection as its own imperfection. When the mother sees her child's imperfections, it is a matter of oneness. Since it is her son, she feels, "His imperfection is my imperfection." But if the mother used her mind, then when she saw all imperfection in the child she would curse God and say, "Oh God, why did You give me such a bad, naughty boy?"</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, real spiritual Masters always identify themselves with their disciples, with their own children. The Masters say, "Their imperfection is mine, their limitation is mine, because I accepted them as my own. As long as they remain imperfect and unrealised, I am unfulfilled. My fulfilment depends on their natures' perfection, on their realisation. Otherwise, I will keep my realisation, but I will remain unmanifest. It is their realisation, their acceptance of my light for the manifestation of the divine on earth, that is my fulfilment. So, as long as they remain imperfect I am imperfect, and as long as they are unfulfilled I am unfulfilled."</p>
<p>My fulfilment entirely depends on my disciples' realisation and perfection. Even my fulfilment is not mine. I am not the Guru. The Guru is the Supreme. There is only one Guru and that is God. I am only a representative, a leader. There cannot be two Gurus. There is only one Guru, the Highest, the Supreme. But somebody has to be His representative for His disciples here. Each Guru is a representative of God. I am a representative of God for my disciples, for those who have accepted me as their own; and they have to take my guidance. I am not the only boatman; there are other boatmen. The world is very big. There are quite a few sincere Masters, and each one has a boat. Each boat will take the sincere seekers to the destined Goal. But only we have to be very careful not to change our boat every day, or we will never reach our Goal. I have a boat and in it I have a few hundred disciples. I will definitely carry the sincere ones to the Golden Shore. The insincere ones will take a little longer time, but they too will definitely go. One has to realise the Truth, one has to be one-pointed so that one can reach the destination.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You don't have to go far to know God's Will. If you just meditate and do selfless service, you can know it. You do not have to adopt a difficult method when there is an easy one. If you cultivate silence to know God's Will, then certainly you will be successful. But there is an easier process. This process is self-giving. If you give yourself totally, then you will see that you will not be carried away by the waves of uncertainty; you will become the ocean itself. So, self-giving is the easiest and most effective way.</p>
<p>One way is to dig and dig and then hope to find some water. But by digging and digging, God knows when you are going to get a glimpse of even a tiny drop of water. This way takes time and is uncertain, and while you are digging and digging if you do not get a glimpse of the water, or consciousness, let us say, then you will be disappointed. You will say, "For six years I have stayed with this Master and I feel that I don't know anything. The best thing will be for me to leave him." Whereas if you use the other way, you will go slowly and steadily. If you give yourself daily and if you throw yourself into the sea of self-dedication, then you will get real satisfaction out of life. So follow the easiest and most effective path-self-giving. Just throw yourself into the sea of peace. You do not know whether you will find dangerous water-animals or jewels inside the water, but you will be safe because it is the sea of peace.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I make my mind quiet? It is such an unending source of confusion that it distracts me from my aspiration.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I make my mind quiet? It is such an unending source of confusion that it distracts me from my aspiration." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is very easy. From now on think that you do not have a mind; it belongs to somebody else. You know that when a little child has money he wants to use it. He does not know whether he is using it for a good purpose or for a bad purpose. If he knows that he has no money, then he keeps quiet; he has nothing to use. Similarly, please feel that you do not have the mind. Make yourself feel that you have only the heart. As soon as some idea enters into your mind, then feel that your mind has nothing to do with it. When the mind bothers you constantly with fear, doubt and worries, simply say that you don't have the mind. But when you feel a little joy, peace or light inside your heart, immediately feel that you have everything to do with it. By convincing yourself that you don't have a particular thing, automatically you will get rid of it.</p>
<p>You may ask how you can live without the mind. But you <em>can</em> live without the mind. You can live with the heart and the heart will do everything for you. In the spiritual life the most important thing is to unlearn whatever the mind has taught you. The things that are important, the things that are illumining, will always remain inside your heart, although the mind may try to grasp them. If you feel that you don't have a mind, then how are you going to be affected by it? But if you feel that you have a mind and it is torturing you all the time, then it will always torture you.</p>
<p>When you are afraid of something, then that very thing will torture you. If you have something good, identify with it and say that you have it. But if you have something bad, please say that you don't have it. Just by saying this, the life of those undivine forces will automatically go away. This kind of self-assertion is extremely good. To get rid of the mind, simply say that you don't have it. If you don t have it, how are you going to use it? Then the heart will take care of you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we transcend the intellect?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we transcend the intellect?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We can transcend the intellect only when we really care for something infinitely higher than the intellect, and that thing is intuition. If our love for one thing surpasses our love for something else, then only can we transcend the second thing. If our love for intuition, which is the direct entrance into truth, is greater than our love for the intellect, then naturally we can transcend the intellect. It is like a ladder. Take the first rung as the intellect and the second as intuition. If we are satisfied with the first rung, there is no necessity to climb up higher. But if we are not satisfied with the first rung, then we will definitely try to go to the second or third rung. It depends on which rung we care for most. We have to know which one we really love. If we care for intellect, then we have to stand on the first rung of the ladder. If it is intuition, then we will go one step higher.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does the mind make itself stop doing what it&#039;s doing?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does the mind make itself stop doing what it&#039;s doing?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The mind will never be calm and quiet unless it consciously listens to some higher power. The higher power here is the heart. If the mind consciously listens to the higher power, then it will derive much benefit. But if the higher power forces the mind to surrender, then the mind will not get the utmost benefit. How can the mind be a calm, quiet and perfect instrument of the higher power of the divine? First we have to enter into the heart and see the difference between the heart's capacity and the mind's capacity. It is we who have to differentiate between the two. It is we who have to see the capacity and the quality of the heart and the capacity and the quality of the mind. It is easy to criticise the mind. The mind is suspecting, the mind is doubting, the mind is limiting. But at the same time, we have to be fully convinced of the capacity of the heart. The heart has limitless capacity on the strength of its oneness with the soul.</p>
<p>Instead of entering into the mind, which is now unlit and obscure, we have to enter into the heart. Let us stay there for as many hours, as many days, as many months, as many years as possible. And then, when we feel that the light, the illumination of the heart-room has permeated our whole existence, let us enter into the mind-room.</p>
<p>In the beginning we have to feel that there is only one room that can save us: the heart-room. Then, when the light of the heart-room enters into the mind-room, we will not discard the mind-room. The mind-room is also a room, and a day will come when we will have to stay in that room because it also has possibility, potentiality and capacity. Up to now, we have not used that room properly due to our own ignorance in the physical, in the vital and in the mind.</p>
<p>To make the mind calm and quiet, to make the mind a proper instrument, a chosen instrument of God, we have to first approach the heart and remain in the heart before entering into the mind. We have to get strength, light and power from the heart and with these qualities enter into the mind. Then we shall be able to compel the mind to surrender its existence to the heart-power for its own good. At that time the surrender of the mind to the heart will not be the surrender of a slave to his master. No, it will be the surrender of our obscure, unaspiring, doubting existence to the confident and everlastingly assured existence of the soul. The mind will not be the loser. On the contrary, the mind will be the real victor over its own ignorance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I go beyond the restless thoughts of my mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I go beyond the restless thoughts of my mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Think of the sea. On the surface of the sea there are waves and it can be very rough, but if you go to the bottom of the sea it is all calm and quiet. On the surface it is all restlessness, but underneath it is all calm and quiet. Think of the mind as a sea. On the surface it is full of thoughts which are like waves, constantly moving. But if you dive deeper you see that there are no waves, there are no thoughts. The earthbound mind is full of thoughts and restlessness on the surface, but in the depths of the mind there are no thoughts, it is all calm and quiet. So it is there that you have to go. When you are in that mind, the vacant, tranquil, calm mind, you can accomplish very many things at one time, because that mind is not the human mind; it is the divine mind. Everything has come from the divine, including the mind, the body and the vital, but when these entities have been divinised, they will be infinitely better than they were before they were divinised. The human mind has not yet been divinised, but the divine mind, the illumined mind and the supermind have been divinised, so naturally they are superior.</p>
<p>As a human being I may have something, for example, a ballpoint pen, and God may have the same thing. Although we call it by the same name, the one that God has will be infinitely superior to the one that I have, because He has infinitely more capacity than I have. The mind that we are now using, the human mind, is full of doubt, suspicion and outer education. But deep within us God is using another mind, which is divinised, illumined and immortal. Vastness and infinity are inside that mind, whereas in the mind that we call our own we cannot even hold more than one thought. The divine mind has the whole universe inside it and by going deep within we can see what the divine mind is doing.</p>
<p>God is controlling the divine mind within us. God has pleased the divine mind, and the divine mind is pleasing God. We are trying to please the human mind, but we are unable to please the human mind and the human mind cannot please us. The thought world cannot please us with thoughts because it is only feeding the human mind. We are constantly seeing the weaknesses of our human mind and the human mind is also constantly seeing our weaknesses. But the divine mind, which has come directly from God, has no weakness at all, because God is operating all the time in that mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you have just entered into an apartment. You need an apartment to live in, and you have gone to see this particular apartment. You are satisfied with one room of the apartment, whereas the other room has not satisfied you at all. The first room is most satisfactory. It is all illumined, clean, clear and full of pure vibrations. The other room is dark. In that room there are all kinds of rubbish and broken furniture. It is all in a mess and everything is most unsatisfactory. But you need an apartment and the landlord says that if you want this apartment you have to take this other room as well. When you rent an apartment, it is up to you to stay in the room that pleases you most; but you have to keep the other room because the landlord does not want to rent the apartment without it.</p>
<p>So let us say that our body is the apartment or the house. In this house there are two rooms: one is full of darkness and the other is full of light. The heart is the room where you have all light and the mind is the room where you have all darkness.</p>
<p>Now, in my house I have many rooms, but I am fond of my own room, my bedroom. There are so many other rooms on the third floor, on the second floor and in the basement, but I am fond of my bedroom, so I spend most of my time there. Now if I don't want to enter into a particular room in this house, I don't need to. I have so many rooms. Why should I use all of them if they do not please me? I stay in the room which pleases me most.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should feel that your heart-room is the room that you need. The other room is the mind, which is full of conflict, darkness and imperfection. This room does not want any perfection or illumination. Again, the room that is already illumined and crying for perfection, illumination and salvation is the heart; so you should try to remain in that room. Then, when you get illumination, salvation and immortality from the heart-room, you bring all these qualities into the dark room. Right now you are unsafe if you enter into the dark room. If you want to enter it, you will be caught by imperfection, bondage and impurity. But once you get illumination, purity, liberation and salvation from the other room, the heart, then you can enter the mind-room, because the light of the heart is infinitely more powerful than the power of darkness in the mind-room.</p>
<p>Right now the heart is not at your disposal. But when its divine qualities are at your command, at that time you can take them and enter into the mind-room. This way you will be safe, and you will be able to illumine and purify the other room. So try to feel that the heart-room is illumined, and it is crying for liberation and immortality. Just enter into the heart-room. When you feel that the wealth of this room has become part and parcel of your life, then you can enter into the dark room to purify and illumine it. At that time you will feel that you have two rooms that you can use.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a destructive thought comes, immediately you have to know that it was founded with destruction. If people continue to do something wrong for two or three days of a month, then negative forces become self-asserting. They say, "What right do you have to throw us out?" Then another thought comes. Inwardly the disciple says to the Master, "If you really care for me, then how is it that you did not prevent me when I started mixing with wrong forces? How is it that you did not stop me? How is it that these things have happened in my life?" That is the most destructive negative force, when the disciple cherishes that kind of thought about the Master. At that time the human in him blames the Supreme for everything.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We will be able to know when the Supreme is inspiring the mind when we observe that the mind is not doubting, belittling or finding fault with anybody, but that it is expanding and illumining like the heart. If the mind is not condemning or finding fault, if it loves the world and it is ready to act like a divine child without constantly finding fault with the world, if it is serving the world like the heart, then we know that it is the divine mind that is inspired and chosen by the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is God's protection that is rotating in your head. It is causing the mind to come out of confusion and wrong forces. So God's protection is rotating around your head. It is protection.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we understand you with the mind?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we understand you with the mind?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you remain in the mind, you will not understand me at all. Here we are all children, children of the Supreme. So we should try to only remain in the heart and, if possible, become the heart itself. Today we have proved to a great extent the necessity of becoming children. The divine in me, the divine in you, is an eternal child. An eternal child is he who gives and who takes. God is the Supreme Child within us. He eternally gives to us. We also try to give to Him. We give Him our aspiration-cry and He gives us His Perfection-Light.</p>
<p>So let us try to bring this supreme philosophy down to the material plane. Today we are observing a special occasion, a special moment in our life of aspiration and dedication. If you can remain in the heart today, then you will understand me properly on the strength of your inseparable oneness with my heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In our inner life and in our meditation, the silent mind is of the greatest necessity. Without this silent mind, progress is difficult. If we bring to the fore the qualities of the heart: love, devotion and surrender, then the doubting mind, the restless mind and the separating mind cannot cause problems. If we bring these qualities to the fore, then naturally there will come a time when we will say, "It is beneath my dignity to draw attention to the mind." But right now the best we can do is to make the mind feel that the only thing that it wants and needs is the heart. In this way we can silence the mind.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part II — The vital, mind, heart and soul</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part II — The vital, mind, heart and soul" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Please live in the heart</h2>

<p>When you live in the vital, you are always frustrated. And you have to know that this frustration will never be satisfied unless and until it destroys the person or thing that has caused the frustration. But even if you see the person who is responsible for your frustration right in front of you, you cannot destroy him. You cannot stab him or strangle him. You will be arrested. So there comes a time when your frustration tries to destroy a vital being inside you instead. When this happens, the vital being tries to escape and while trying to escape, very often, it is caught by a giant force which we call a lower vital force. This force adds to the power of frustration and then real destruction starts.</p>
<p>We have three kinds of vital: the lower vital, the human vital and the divine vital. First your frustration enters into the simple human or ordinary vital, and then if you are not fully illumined, the lower vital forces come forward. When the lower vital comes forward and adds to the strength of the human vital, you begin destroying yourself. Because of frustration in the ordinary vital caused by your day-to-day activities, the evil force of the lower vital comes to the human vital.</p>
<p>When you live in the mind, two things happen. One is that doubt comes and the other is that you have a feeling of inferiority. Now, if you doubt God, no harm. If you doubt me as a spiritual Master, no harm. If you doubt your husband or your wife, no harm. But if you doubt yourself, you are digging your own grave. What does God do if you doubt Him? He immediately smiles and says, "All right, I have My Eternity for My son or daughter. I shall use my Eternity-weapon and conquer My child's doubt." And if you doubt me, I say I am helpless. But when you doubt yourself or your spiritual life, no matter how much God or I tell you not to doubt yourself, at that time you think you don't have any capacity. So please don't doubt yourself. If you do, there is no salvation.</p>
<p>Once in six months, if you doubt your spiritual life, it is not very serious. But some disciples doubt their spiritual life consciously and constantly, so they can never make spiritual progress. True, there were great spiritual Masters and very advanced souls like Vivekananda and others who doubted their spiritual life. But again, they were giants. In general, if ordinary human beings cherish doubt for a few days or a month or so, they immediately drop from their previous level of spiritual development.</p>
<p>If you have come to a certain standard and if you want to take rest, you are mistaken if you think that after five or ten years you can go forward from the same point. In the spiritual life, once you begin doubting, you immediately come to a standstill. The next day, you won't even be able to stay at this point and the following day you will be compelled to go back to your starting point, or actually even further. There is a kind of inner retribution. You got the opportunity, but after getting it, you misused it by doubting your spiritual life. Before you accept the spiritual life, you can doubt your spiritual life. But if you doubt your spiritual life after you get inner, divine assistance, then you cannot remain in the same place. If you doubt the Master or God, compassion will be able to be of some help to you. But if you doubt yourself, since you don't have the same kind of compassion for yourself, realisation becomes a very long process. If you are about to take five steps, and you doubt yourself, then you go back twenty-five steps. So I ask the disciples not to cherish doubt. To stay in the mind means to doubt, and each time you doubt you will go backwards. Why do this if you know there is a way to shorten your journey instead? The shortest path is the path of the heart. So please live in the heart, and not in the vital or the mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If it comes from the heart, easily you will know because it will be so convincing. The mind will not come and interfere. Suppose you have receive a message and you carry it out. If you feel, "Only if I get success from this message will I know it was correct," then you will know that it comes from the mind. But if you feel that you have got an inner message and you will execute it whether it is successful or not, then that message is most assuredly coming from the heart.</p>
