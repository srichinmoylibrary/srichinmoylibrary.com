<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You know the significance of an eagle. An eagle flies high, but its consciousness is very low. It is like a seeker who pretends to be flying very high while he is meditating, but his consciousness is in the lower vital or in the gossip world or somewhere else undivine. When you saw your old friend, who was still in the consciousness that you had before you entered into the spiritual life, your old undivine life all of a sudden came forward and attacked your spiritual life. The undivine life has a kind of arrogance and a feeling of superiority. It is not only the divine life that feels it is superior. The life of aspiration feels that it is the real life, but the life of desire, the undivine life, feels that <em>it</em> is the real life. Your previous life was a life of desire; there was no aspiration in it. Although you used to lead a very unaspiring life, inside you there was a feeling of superiority. You felt superior to people who were not doing as you were doing. You felt that they were all fools, that they were not experiencing anything in their lives; you felt that either they were cowards or they did not have enough sense to enter into the adventure of life. That kind of pride you had. Just as the eagle flies high but has a very low consciousness, so also you were going up and becoming proud, haughty and arrogant, but your consciousness was on a very low, low plane.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden, because you accepted the spiritual life, your soul came to the fore. Since you accepted the spiritual life soulfully and consciously, your soul used its power and destroyed the eagle. The eagle represented the false way of climbing. The soul will let you climb up and soar above, but in a true way, with aspiration, and not the other way, with desire and arrogance and a negative, destructive feeling of superiority. It was your soul's light that destroyed your undivine qualities in this dream.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! This dream meant that it was necessary for you to accept life powerfully and courageously. You had entered into a new life, and there was a subtle fear in you. So it was tremendous energy that I was pouring into you in this dream. This energy was entering into you and, at the same time, like a magnet it was pulling you. Through my concentration I made a conscious entrance into your soul so that you would not have fear. It was necessary for you to be powerful and dynamic so that you could get a bumper crop of Truth, Light and Bliss in your new life.</p>

The word &#039;Arjuna&#039; came out of my stomach." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! Krishna and Arjuna have the very closest connection with each other. They are spiritual brothers. Arjuna signifies the inner instrument, and Krishna himself represents the Highest. So Krishna wants you to be a real divine, detached and surrendered instrument of the Supreme. To be Arjuna means to be the dearest, most effective, most faithful and devoted chosen instrument of God. And the voice that came from within means you identified yourself with Arjuna's consciousness. That is to say, you wanted to be as powerful, as devoted, as surrendered to your own Master as Arjuna was to Krishna.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First meditate on the heart and feel the real presence of light. Then take this light and throw it into the dark abyss of the navel for purification. Then you cannot have any bad dreams because your vital will be illumined.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, I had this dream about Sri Anandamayi Ma. She gave me four pictures. The two middle ones were white. The first one was that of my former Master&#039;s own Master, and the one on the far end I could not recognise.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, I had this dream about Sri Anandamayi Ma. She gave me four pictures. The two middle ones were white. The first one was that of my former Master&#039;s own Master, and the one on the far end I could not recognise." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very good! There are many, many false teachers on earth, but Anandamayi Ma happens to be one of the absolutely sincere spiritual Masters who has really realised God. You hear of hundreds of spiritual Masters, but I wish to tell you people that you will realise God before many of them. But Anandamayi Ma is one of the very, very few who have really realised God and who can speak on God with authority.</p>
<p>I have a very close inner connection with her. Outwardly we have seen each other only once, many years ago, and then we didn't talk. We didn't have the necessity. We just stood near each other, and she looked at me and I looked at her; that's all. But in one second's glance we did many things inwardly, although outwardly we didn't have any time. Then I went home and wrote a beautiful poem about her, using the word <em>Nirmala</em> in the first line. Believe it or not, at that time I didn't even know her given name. Later I read her biography and learned much about her. On the first page I got her name, <em>Nirmala</em>.</p>
<p>To come back to your dream, the white colour means purity. <em>Nirmala</em> also means purity. Out of the four pictures, she gave you two white ones which represent purity. She gave you the highest purity, transcendental purity, and warned you about the purity of the Master and the other person you did not recognise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, if we have a dream in which you appear to us and tell us something very clearly, is it the same thing as your telling it to us face to face?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, if we have a dream in which you appear to us and tell us something very clearly, is it the same thing as your telling it to us face to face?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! If you see me vividly and if it is something very solid and distinct, then if I give you some message it is as good as my giving you the message on the physical plane. But the only thing is that if it is a serious matter, it is better that you clarify it on the physical plane. Otherwise, it may create real problems. It may be wishful thinking. It is true, as I have told you people before, that no hostile force can take my form, but you may create me with your own imagination.</p>
<p>It has happened a few times that a spiritual Master will say something in a dream which the disciple really likes. Then, when the Master on the physical plane says it was all false, the disciple will not believe him. I know of a case where a very sincere seeker wrote to his Master, "Master, you came to me and it was so vivid. You told me that in this incarnation there is no other way for me to get realisation except by committing suicide." The Master said, "Impossible! I have not told you that." But the disciple said, "Here on the physical plane you are jealous of me. If I realise God, I will be equal to you. That is why you are denying this. But on the inner plane you are not jealous; that is why you have told me the truth. So the best thing is for me to commit suicide, and then I will realise God."</p>
<p>It is always advisable to listen to the Master on the physical plane. If you have a dream, wonderful! Tell the Master, and if it is genuine, the Master will immediately say so. If you feel that he has said something on the inner plane, he can easily tell you on the outer plane if it is true. The Master is the same person. He will definitely know whether he has said something to the particular disciple. But if he denies it, then it is not to be accepted.</p>
<p>When a spiritual Master finds it difficult to offer a message to a disciple on the physical plane, it may happen that it is easier for him to offer the same message on the inner plane in a dream. It has happened in hundreds and thousands of cases. When the disciple comes to the Master on the physical plane, the disciple immediately sees the physical in the Master. At that time, he cannot think of the Master as the Highest for him. But in the inner plane, where there is no mental barrier, the disciple sees the real height of the Master, or at least he sees more of his height than he can see on the physical plane. So the disciple has more faith at that time in the Master's words. If the Master says something, the disciple believes it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to say that the spiritual path is most arduous, and it is very steep. When you have to go up, it is most difficult. The beings you saw were not actually nuns; they were angels. But in your dream you felt they were nuns because your physical mind was operating. Your physical mind did not want to feel that you saw angels, because it did not want you to get the greatest joy. The mind is like that. It destroys everything. With your heart you went up very high, but your mind wanted to diminish your joy. So the mind made you see them as nuns. If the mind had not interfered, then you would have been so happy to see angels with flowers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have vital dreams, they have to be purified. If you leave your room messy, you cannot expect that if you enter into the room, all of a sudden it will automatically be clean. You have to enter into the room and try to clean up the mess, pick up some things, throw away some things.</p>
<p>Here in meditation you will seek light, and this light has to enter into your vital to purify it. If you enter into a dark room without a light, you won't see anything. Then you will think that everything is all right. But once you turn on the light, you will see that nothing is all right, that there are all destructive forces in the room. This is good, because then you will be in a position to transform these forces. When you get light and bliss from your meditation, when you enter into the vital world, there is every possibility of purifying it. So don't worry about these vital dreams. When you have a wonderful meditation, try to bring the light from your meditation into your vital dreams and purify them. Let your dreams be purified by the power of your meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Wings mean that the disciples have soaring aspiration. They are not the wings of an angel or the wings of a bird, but soaring aspiration that flies very, very high, infinitely higher than a bird. It is absolutely true that my disciples are most sincerely trying to develop and increase their power of aspiration. They have intense aspiration. Disciples who aspire definitely have these inner wings, which are called aspiration.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Green means new life. If your sister is wearing a green sari, new life, new hope has entered into her. Now there are two types of twilight. One is early morning twilight and one is evening twilight. Which one was in your dream?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The green sari means inspiration, dynamic energy, new hope, new identity, new life, and twilight means a sort of light and darkness, let us say half light and half darkness. Although your sister has hope and inspiration and cries for new life, she is not fully ready to accept the spiritual path. She is ready to have fifty percent darkness and fifty percent light. But if she were really aspiring, she would want to have one hundred percent light.</p>
<p>She has or had the opportunity to be dynamic, to be very fresh and full of enthusiasm, and to enter into the sea of light, but she did not care for the opportunity. She did not avail herself of it. She wants to enjoy both the outer world and the inner world together, which is impossible. She wanted to enjoy both the outer world of darkness and the inner world of illumination at the same time. She wanted half light and half darkness in her life, a mixture of both. But a mixture of both you cannot have. Either you have to have light or darkness; you cannot be in between.</p>

Also I saw the sky which was like a golden dawn, like when the sun is rising over the land and casting a gold light." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The sky signifies vastness. And the vast land that you saw also represents vastness. High above you there is vastness and here where you are standing there is also vastness. When the vastness above and the vastness around you meet together, then only will fulfilment come. The higher vastness means Heaven, and the other vastness is earth, where you are living. When our earth-consciousness is widened, immediately the Heaven-consciousness, which is infinitely wider than the earth-consciousness, meets with the earth-consciousness. When they meet together, immediately you see a gold colour. This is the colour of divine manifestation. When earth is receptive, then the Light of Heaven can enter into it. When earth's heart is wide, immediately Light from Heaven can enter. At that time, Heaven's illumining consciousness and earth's aspiring consciousness become one. And when they have become one, it is a manifestation of the divine Reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Blue signifies something very vast, something infinite, and a ball means the world or the universal Consciousness. The blue ball here represents the eternal instrument. I was telling you that the Supreme is making you a dependable instrument of His.</p>
