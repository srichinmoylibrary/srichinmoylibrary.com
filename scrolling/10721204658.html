<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Art is at once finite and infinite. Geometry offers us the message of the finite proceeding toward the infinite. Sometimes geometry wants to offer us a glimpse of the Infinite in the finite itself. Art also does this, but when art does it, it does it in a subtle, delicate and soul-stirring way. Geometry does it in a dry, one-pointed way with the intellectual mind and the developed brain.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sport means joy. Sport means delight, inner delight. You know that we came from delight, we grow in delight and at the end of our journey’s close we enter into delight once again. The greatest gift of art is joy, and joy is the revelation of sport. They go together. But if you achieve joy through art, the joy is different. There the joy is coming in the mental and vital plane, whereas if you achieve joy through sport, it is coming on the physical and vital plane. But the goal of art and the goal of sport are the same. Both embody the same ultimate goal and have the same goal. Inside art is greatest joy and inside sport is greatest joy.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you concentrate on the throat chakra, you will be able to become a very good artist, musician, writer, dancer or singer. This does not mean that the other centres do not have the capacity to help you in this way, but the throat centre has the utmost capacity. It is like the refrigerator in a house. The food consciousness or the vibration of the food is in the house, but if I go to the refrigerator in the kitchen, then immediately I get the food.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Magic is a form of art, but only when it is used in an innocent way. If you are giving innocent joy in an innocent way to innocent people, then magic is an art. But if you have the idea that you want to become the greatest magician and fool everybody, this is not art. When you are dating the trick, you should not have the idea of deceiving anybody; only feel that you are doing something which will give others joy. You have to know what motive you have in showing magic. If you have the idea of deceiving others, then that is not art. Art has to be on a higher plane. If you only want to distribute joy, if you embody innocent joy, then you have to know that the capacity to express and distribute joy is a form of art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Everybody has to have artistic capacity. Either in this incarnation or in a previous incarnation or in some future incarnation everybody will have artistic capacity. One form of artistic capacity is to be able to draw something or play some instrument. But life itself can also be an art. How sincere one is to oneself, how sincere one is to God, how devoted one is to Truth — that is also an art. That particular art is not denied to anybody. That art, which is the supreme art, everybody can have. The other kinds of art are like branches which branch out from the art that is the life-tree. If one particular branch has most delicious fruits or beautiful flowers, naturally it adds to the beauty and wealth of the tree itself.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes. Some are doing it consciously, and some are doing it unconsciously. Those who are doing it unconsciously, we can’t always appreciate. All human beings are trying to realise God, but those who are not consciously aspiring we usually do not like to spend our time with. We shall all realise God in the course of Eternity, just because that is God’s Plan. But there is a great difference between you people who are aspiring consciously and those who are not aspiring. They may take millions of years to achieve what you will do in a few hundred years or so, now that you have begun to aspire consciously. Similarly, you have to know the difference between consciously aspiring artists and unconsciously aspiring artists.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you get a poem from the higher vital world, you will get the feeling of what you call a surge. It is like a very, very big wave, a huge wave, that washes ashore from the ocean. It covers the length and breadth of everything and washes away all impurity and everything else it touches. But when you get a poem from the illumined mental world, even if it just touches you, immediately you feel a sense of illumination in your entire being. The one is like a big, surging wave that spreads all around and inundates everything, washing away all impurity. The other totally illumines your whole being. Before, you felt that you were in darkness, that you were the ugliest person, absolutely impure. But when the flash comes from the illumined mind, the things that were dark become fully illumined. Your whole existence may have been in darkness, but as soon as you compose a poem from the illumined mind, immediately your outer being becomes radiant, illumined and totally transformed.</p>

What is the difference between an art and a science?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is true that the same achievement some people will call science and some people will call art. But we have to know that a scientific achievement comes mostly from the mind or intellect or sometimes even from flashes of intuition. But the same thing, if it comes from the heart or soul rather than from the mind, is art. A scientific achievement need not be from the mind, not even from the intellect; the greatest scientific achievements come directly from the intuitive plane. But if the achievement comes from the heart, from the psychic being, the inner being, then it is art, spontaneous art. The thing is the same, but we call it different things according to which plane it comes from. Two factories may produce the same thing, but just because the product is coming from two different factories, it has two different brand names. But actually the thing is the same.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing is to become an artist yourself. If you can’t become an artist, then you will appreciate the artist. First I want to become something; if I can’t become something, then immediately I will enter into somebody who has become that thing and become one with him. When I enter into his soul and establish a free access to it, when I become one with him, gradually I develop the same capacity that he has.</p>
<p>There are some people who do not care for arts such as music, painting or dancing; they care only for their own spiritual realisation. There have been many spiritual Masters who did not care for any kind of art except the supreme art, which is God-realisation and God-discovery. But if you want to be a tree with branches all around and millions of leaves and flowers, then it is absolutely necessary for you to appreciate others who have the artistic capacity which you are crying for. By appreciating them, gradually, gradually you also develop the capacity to appreciate their art, and this is also one of the ways to develop artistic capacity.</p>

Is this merely a metaphor or are there actually beings in the higher worlds that preside over certain arts?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> For each art there will be a particular deity. But also there is the goddess Saraswati who is the principal ruler of art. It is not that she only plays on the vina. She gives knowledge and wisdom, the greatest art. Of all arts, Wisdom-Light is the best. There are other deities who also preside over art in general. If a seeker does not want to accept life as an art, if he wants only to be a painter or a musician or a singer or something, then he does not approach the one who embodies everything.</p>
<p>If I want to be a painter, then I approach a particular deity who has some divine painting capacity. But if I want to be God’s artist, if I want my life to be a supreme work of art, at that time my prayer goes to the highest, to one who embodies all the capacities of life. It need not be the Supreme, but perhaps somebody whom the Supreme has made His representative, someone who embodies all the artistic capacities which represent life as such. I will try to reach the cosmic god or goddess who embodies all the qualities of life as an art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, all parts of the being can create art just by appreciating something. As soon as we appreciate somebody or something, we are creating art. Our appreciation itself is a form of beauty, a creative capacity or a form of art. Our appreciation becomes an act of offering. Offering is creation and creation is art. Even in eating food, if we appreciate the food, immediately our appreciation itself is a form of art, because our appreciation is giving life to the thing that we are eating. Otherwise, it is all lifeless. When we see a flower, when we appreciate the flower, immediately we add beauty to the flower. If we use our third eye, we shall see that the flower is already beautiful; but the moment we appreciate it, our appreciation becomes an added life to the beauty of the flower itself. So every part of us, if we use it properly, can create a form of art.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you try to force it, there will be a yawning gulf between your first line and your second line. The first line will be filled with light and the second line will be as prosaic as possible. If you try to force inspiration to come to you, it will bring you nothing. Just wait for inspiration. Some people write one line, then have to wait for ten days or even two years. In your case, since you are a seeker, you don’t have to wait for two years. Vivekananda used to say that if you can’t drink the purest distilled water or Ganges water, that does not mean that you have to drink water from the street. No, you know that it would make you ill. Here also, if you can’t get the highest inspiration or cannot maintain it after one line, the best thing is to not write any more. When you aspire the next day or the day after, in a few days you will get more inspiration. Don’t try to finish the poem right then and there. Otherwise, you will end up with one diamond and the rest just pieces of an earthen pot. That will be most deplorable. If you want to offer something to the world, you have to try to keep the same standard.</p>
