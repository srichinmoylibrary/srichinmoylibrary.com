  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why is it that I find it so difficult to surrender to my inner life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why is it that I find it so difficult to surrender to my inner life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You constantly surrender to earthly things â€” noise, the traffic lights, the government. You feel that you are helpless if you do not surrender to these things, and totally lost, whereas if you do surrender, at least you can maintain your existence on earth. You feel you have to be clever to stay on earth. You feel you have to make some compromise between your desires and the world that you actually see around you. So whatever the earth gives you, even if it is a form of torture, you feel that you have to accept it.</p>
<p>Now if you want to lead an aspiring life, then you have to have this same kind of feeling towards spiritual things. You have to feel that if you do not pray, if you do not meditate, then you will be totally lost; if you do not cry, if you do not surrender to the higher divinity, then your whole existence will be of no value and you need not stay on earth. You have to feel that without the inner guidance you are totally helpless and lost. And this inner guidance comes only when you really want to surrender your ignorance to the Light within you.</p>
<p>There are millions and billions of people on earth who are not praying and meditating, but they still exist, although they may be living an animal life. But if you feel that it is not enough just to maintain your existence on earth, if you feel that your existence should have some meaning, some purpose, some fulfilment, then you have to go to the inner life, the spiritual life. If you see that only the inner life can offer you Peace, Light and Bliss, then naturally you will surrender to the inner life, the life of purity, the life of reality.</p>
<p>So aspiring people will try to go beyond earthly circumstances and events and surrender to their inner divinity. This is not the surrender of a slave to the master; it is not a helpless surrender. Here one surrenders his imperfections, limitations, bondage and ignorance to his highest Self, which is flooded with Peace, Light and Bliss. Here one does not lose his individuality or personality. No! Rather his individuality and his personality are enlarged. They expand into Infinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Will meditation enable us to get rid of bad karma?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Will meditation enable us to get rid of bad karma?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to get rid of your bad karma, the first thing you have to do is to forget about it. If you think of it, unconsciously you are cherishing it. But if you think of good karma â€” that is to say, aspiration, concentration and meditation â€” then you are walking along the right path.</p>
<p>What you did yesterday is not at all important now. What is of paramount importance is what you now want to be. We have to know that we are not the children of the past, but the children of the Golden Future. Yesterday did not give you realisation. Yesterday did not give you fulfilment. You have to know that if you look backward, you will remain where you were or where you are. But if you look forward, one day you will reach your Goal.</p>
<p>So in order to get rid of bad karma, you should enter into the field of concentration and meditation. The only medicine to cure bad karma from the past is meditation or, if that is too difficult, concentration in the form of aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I read someplace that when one uses sexual energy he is using up some spiritual energy at the same time. Is this true? If so, what can be done if one wants to lead a spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I read someplace that when one uses sexual energy he is using up some spiritual energy at the same time. Is this true? If so, what can be done if one wants to lead a spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What you have read is absolutely true. Animal human life and divine God-life do not and cannot go together. To attain the highest Truth, the seeker needs total purification and transformation of his lower vital. But one cannot realise God overnight. It is impossible! You do not get your master's degree in a day, or even in a year. It may require twenty years of study to achieve. God-realisation is a far more difficult subject. It may require twenty or thirty years, a lifetime, even many more incarnations for you to realise God, depending on your present aspiration and your previous spiritual life.</p>
<p>But if you tell a beginner that he will have to give up his lower vital life, sex life, all at once, he will say, "Impossible! How can I do that?" If he has to do this, he will never enter into the spiritual life. Slowly and steadily he has to make headway towards his Goal.</p>
<p>Transforming one's sex life is like giving up a bad habit, but it is usually more difficult and it takes a longer time. Suppose somebody drinks a lot. If he drinks six or seven times a day, let him first come to realise the fact that this is something harmful for his God-realisation. Then let him try to drink less. If he drinks six times a day, let him change to five times. After a few days, let him drink four times a day. Then, after a while longer, let him drink three times a day. Gradually, let him diminish his desire for alcohol. In our ordinary human life we have many weaknesses. If we try to conquer them all at once, the body will resist and break down. We shall be torn into pieces. We have to have a real inner will, the soul's will, to conquer our desires slowly and steadily. Otherwise, the body will revolt.</p>
<p>If one enters into the spiritual life and says, "Today I want to conquer all my lower propensities," he is just fooling himself. Tomorrow his physical mind will torture him with doubts. His impure and cruel vital will try to punish him in every way. He will feel miserable. He will be frustrated, and inside his frustration his own destruction will loom large. The lower vital life must be transformed completely before God-realisation can take place, but I advise my students to go slowly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What is wisdom? Wisdom is the knowledge of the soul. Wisdom is the light of the soul, which gives us the knowledge of the soul. Wisdom is a spark of the inner sun. Wisdom is one's conscious awareness of one's ultimate Reality, and this ultimate Reality is the realisation that man is God yet to be manifested and God is man yet to be realised fully. This is the ultimate wisdom.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you please explain what an authentic Guru is?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you please explain what an authentic Guru is?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The real Guru is the Inner Pilot, the Supreme. An authentic Guru will tell you categorically that he is not the Guru. The human Guru is only the representative of the Inner Pilot, and only for those who have implicit faith in his realisation. An authentic Guru will inspire all seekers, no matter which path they follow. His realisation undoubtedly is for the entire world, but it is for his own spiritual children that he is one hundred per cent responsible. There are many authentic Gurus at different levels and with different standards. It is through self-giving and self-offering that each one fulfils the Message of the Beyond according to his own capacity. An authentic Guru will never say that he will be able to give illumination or God-realisation to any seeker overnight, or instantaneously, or in a few short weeks, no matter how sincere, how devoted or how surrendered the seeker is.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru says that when the heart's aspiration, the soul's light and the life's dedication become one, the seeker realises God. Slow and steady wins the race: this is the theory, the realisation and the proclamation of an authentic Guru. At God's choice Hour, an authentic Guru shows his young brothers and sisters the Face of God.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru will never say that money-power will enable a seeker to realise God. If a seeker uses money-power divinely with his dedication-power, it will help him in God-realisation. But if a seeker feels that by offering money to a spiritual Master he will be able to realise God or even to expedite his realisation, then I wish to say that that particular seeker has reached the zenith of stupidity. Money-power is undoubtedly a power of great significance. When it is properly used it adds to one's heart-power. But he who wants to realise God will discover that heart-power is more than enough. No human power, no earthly power is necessary to see God face to face, but heart-power is of paramount importance. This heart-power is the power of dedicated service, the power of oneness with the universe, the power of constant and conscious surrender to the Will of the Inner Pilot.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru will always say that just as none of his disciples are indispensable, so too he is not indispensable. Only God, the Inner Pilot, is indispensable; and this Inner Pilot is in everyone. This Inner Pilot is the real Boatman who carries the seeker in His Golden Boat to the Golden Shores of the ever-transcending Beyond.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru will always say that he is a mere instrument of the Inner Pilot. He will get his guidance from the Inner Pilot of his disciples. He is only the messenger who carries his disciples' ignorance to the Supreme Pilot and brings down infinite Compassion and Blessings from the Supreme Pilot to his disciples. He carries both his disciples' ignorance and their aspiration to the Supreme, and he brings down from the Supreme Light, Delight, Perfection and more, infinitely more.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru is at once the real brother of mankind and the eternal son of Heaven. On the strength of his oneness with humanity, an authentic Guru cries day in and day out for humanity's liberation. At the same time, on the strength of his oneness with the Supreme Pilot, he smiles constantly with Him on the transcendental Throne of Reality, Divinity and Immortality.</p>
<p>An authentic Guru is humanity's best gift to Divinity and Divinity's best gift to humanity. Humanity's gift Divinity accepts with deepest concern and pride. Divinity's gift humanity accepts with deepest gratitude and pride.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you think an aspirant needs a living Guru for realisation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you think an aspirant needs a living Guru for realisation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To be very frank with you, a living Guru is not absolutely indispensable in order to realise God. The first person who realised God on earth, the very first realised soul, had no human Guru. He had only God as his Guru.</p>
<p>If you have a Guru, however, it facilitates your inner spiritual progress. A Guru is your private tutor in the spiritual life. At every moment in life's journey, ignorance tries to test you, examine you and torture you, but this private tutor will teach you how to pass the examination most easily. If you have a private tutor for any subject, you know how much help you can get. Moreover, once you get into your Guru's boat, he will take you to the Golden Shore. You can sing on the boat, you can dance, you can even sleep; but he will take you safely to the Goal.</p>
<p>It is absurd to feel that for everything else in life we need a teacher but not for God-realisation. Why does one go to the university when he can study at home? It is because he feels that he will get expert instruction from people who know the subject well. If someone is wise enough and wants to run towards his Goal instead of stumbling or merely walking, then certainly he will take the help of a Guru. But again, God is in everybody, and if one feels that he does not need human help, he is most welcome to try his capacity alone.</p>
<p>If someone becomes a true disciple of a Master, he does not feel that he and his Guru are two totally different beings. He does not feel that his Guru is at the top of the tree and he is at the foot of the tree, all the time washing the feet of the Guru. No, he feels that the Guru is his own highest part. He feels that he and the Guru are one, that the Guru is his own highest and most developed part. Therefore, a true disciple does not find any difficulty in surrendering his lowest part to his highest part. It is not beneath his dignity, because he knows that both the highest and the lowest are his very own.</p>

<p>Sri Chinmoy was invited to give a series of six spiritual talks in the spring of 1973 by Columbia University's centre for religious activities, Earl Hall. The lectures were held in St.Paul's Chapel on the University campus.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy offers his deepest blessingful gratitude to P., who made the arrangements for these talks. The Master also offers his blessingful gratitude to B. who was in charge of coordination.</p>
<p>At the end of each lecture in this series, Sri Chinmoy invited spiritual questions from the audience. Selected questions and answers follow the talks.</p>
