<p>As soon as I sat down on the bamboo chair at that restaurant, I liked the chair so much. It was very large and comfortable, and I was taking lots of exercises on it.</p>
<p>I said jokingly to myself, "Since I am a multi-millionaire, I am going to buy the chair."</p>
<p>Savyasachi went to ask about buying the chair, but the boss was not there and the workers said they couldn't sell the chair. So we waited and waited for the boss. After about half an hour he came in, and Savyasachi offered him 20,000 rp. for the chair.</p>
<p>The boss looked at the workers and the workers looked at the boss. They didn't understand why we wanted this particular chair and they weren't sure what to do.</p>
<p>The boss said this chair was old, but we could buy a new one at another place. I said, "No, I want to buy this one."</p>
<p>Again they hesitated. The boss looked at us and the two girls looked at us, but nobody said anything.</p>
<p>Then Savyasachi took the 20,000 rp. and touched the hands of the two girls and the boss together. Finally they agreed.</p>
<p>What a crazy thing to buy a chair in a restaurant! But I had gotten such good vibrations from the chair while I was taking exercise on it that I said, "I am not going to leave this chair here."</p>

<p>Many reporters came to our press conference. Most of them were so nice. But the man from Jakarta was bad. Such nasty questions he asked!</p>
<p>First he asked why I was not going to Russia, China and North Korea. What kind of question is that!</p>
<p>I said that the time has not come for me to go to those places.</p>
<p>Then, when I was meditating before doing my lifts, he said, "Is there any special reason why you are looking towards the East?"</p>
<p>I said, "Here I don't know where East or West is."</p>
<p>Most of the reporters were so nice, but always there is someone to challenge and annoy us.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday the manager of the Bali Beach Hotel said that he had seen three holy men in his lifetime.</p>
<p>He saw the Dalai Lama from a distance when he came to Indonesia. He also saw the Pope from a distance.</p>
<p>Then he said that I was the third spiritual figure he had seen. Only with me he could talk and take pictures!</p>

<p>Since the television programme and the newspaper articles about me have come out, so many people recognise me.</p>
<p>Yesterday five young girls jumped up when they saw me. One pretended to play the flute and another pretended to lift a weight over her head. Then they sang "Bali, Bali," imitating our singers.</p>
<p>At another place three young men all pretended to lift weights overhead when they saw me.</p>

<p>About a thousand people came to our Belgium Peace Concert. They were so receptive! After the performance, about three hundred seekers passed by me. Many showed most sincere devotion. About a hundred of them prostrated themselves at my feet, according to Indian tradition. They were not showing off; they did it with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>For years and years we have been offering Peace Concerts here, there and everywhere. God knows how much light the seekers have actually received. But here some seekers definitely and wholeheartedly received peace, love and joy from me. So I was very happy and grateful.</p>

<p>After my television interview, a man from the Dutch radio station also wanted to interview me.</p>
<p>We were sitting face to face, and he was asking me many spiritual questions. At one point he stood up and came over to me and said, "There are some people who are very, very close to God, and I can see you are one of those."</p>

<p>For the first time, I met with the President and Prime Minister of a country and the head of their spiritual community, all in a matter of two hours. This happened in Iceland.</p>
<p>First I met with the Prime Minister for about ten minutes or so. He had agreed to meet with me because some Members of Parliament had requested it. But he did not know anything about me. He asked so many questions!</p>
<p>The room where we met was simplicity incarnate. Even the mayors' offices that I have been to are all decorated very gorgeously. But this room was simpler than the simplest.</p>

<p>Next I met with the President of Iceland. Her office was just next to the Prime Minister's. In the beginning she allowed the newspaper photographers and television people to take pictures, but then she asked everyone to leave. She knew all about me, and she wanted to have a very private talk, with no tape recorders or photographers. So we had a very soulful heart-to-heart talk for about half an hour.</p>
<p>We spoke about peace and both of us understood one another. Towards the end she was telling me that she wants to lead a spiritual life like us, but right now it is simply impossible for her.</p>
<p>She is very simple, very kind-hearted, very intelligent and quite dynamic. She is also mature, tolerant and self-giving. I was extremely pleased with the interview.</p>

<p>The Bishop of the Lutheran Church of Reykjavik was so nice from the beginning to the end. He showed me such affection. We had an interview for over an hour.</p>
<p>At first he said he wanted a private interview and that nobody could accompany me. But then he changed his mind and invited all the disciples to come in.</p>
<p>He was begging everyone to drink tea or coffee and to eat the bread and cheese that he had provided. It was like a family gathering.</p>
<p>He could not understand why I do not drink tea or coffee, so I had to give a long explanation. Then, when he heard that I am a vegetarian, he had a volley of questions.</p>
<p>He knew all about prayer but had no idea what meditation is. He could not imagine how anybody could meditate without thought. So we had a long discussion about prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>I told him that when I was in India I used to meditate for six or seven hours at a time. He believed what I told him, but he said that it was impossible for him to keep his own mind quiet for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>At the end we meditated for a minute or two and prayed with our heads down. Then he stood up and said, "You know, I am 86 years old." Then he placed his hands on my shoulders and pressed down on them with utmost affection! He was so sweet, so kind and so full of affection, love and wisdom!</p>

<p>When I went to Washington, D.C., I spent a long time inside the Jefferson Memorial. The design I liked so much, but the statue of Jefferson really disappointed me.</p>
<p>They showed him as a military man — with a heroic spirit. But his so-called outer heroism was nothing in comparison with his inner vision and wisdom-light. These were his main qualities. America loves dynamism, and the outer dynamism of a soldier this statue has. But the inner wisdom of a statesman or true world leader the statue does not show.</p>
<p>On the wall were some significant statements by Jefferson. Unfortunately, he came long before the world, especially America, was prepared for his beautiful and powerful wisdom-light. Always prophets come at least one minute before the world is able to appreciate them. When they are here, they are not accepted. They have such wisdom, but they are not taken seriously. Only afterwards does the world accept and appreciate them.</p>

<p>Then a man recognised me and said, "Sri, Sri, Sri Chinmoy! Your disciples are so lucky!" He had a little mustache and was drinking coffee on the way to the plane.</p>
<p>I wanted to say that I was the lucky one, but it didn't come out. So I just said "Thank you."</p>
