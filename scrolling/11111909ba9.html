<p>This morning an old lady with a dog said to me, "You are tired?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes, I am tired."</p>
<p>"How many miles?" she asked.</p>
<p>I answered, "Six and a half."</p>
<p>She said, "Kidding? Don't have to kill yourself. Don't be a fool, honey."</p>
<p>This was the first time I had ever seen her.</p>

<p>One night I wanted to go for a sixteen-mile run. I started about 3 a.m. at Flushing Meadow Park and my road crew was following me in a car. After I had gone six miles, it started raining heavily. It was a real torrential downpour which lasted the whole night. But still I went on, went on, with my faithful crew.</p>

<p>Last year I was practising on my running machine early one morning when a former disciple's soul visited me. The soul said, "I wish I could run as fast in the inner world as you are running on this machine." That night, this particular seeker visited the Jharna-Kala Gallery, seeing me for the first time in a few years.</p>

<p>At about five-thirty one morning, a husband and wife were in front of their house. The husband was putting garbage in the garbage can and the wife was watering the lawn.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wife got inspiration to water me with the sprinkler. Her husband said to her, "Honey, why did you do that? Do you think he appreciates it?" Then she laughed and laughed. Actually, I don't like the sprinkler at all. As soon as I see one I run away.</p>

<p>My road crew is very good, but sometimes when I give them a job, they forget to do it. Then, I bark at them like anything.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to run only 400 metres, and when I didn't see any mark, I said, "Perhaps I made a mistake." I went on running farther and farther. Finally it became one mile — 800 metres one way and 800 back. My road crew had forgotten to measure that route.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I had them drive that way in a car and we discovered that I had run one mile extra.</p>

<p>Today after I had run a mile and a half, a little dog...it was so ferocious...suddenly jumped at me and tried to bite me.</p>
<p>O God, what could I do? I was running in the street and there were a lot of cars coming. If you go that side, you will end up inside the car and if you go this side, the dog will bite you. Either way is dangerous.</p>
<p>But that is not the story. While the dog was trying to bite me, an elderly woman was enjoying it. And it was her dog! I had to change the position of my legs, scream something and pretend I had a stone. For twenty metres the dog chased me, and the old lady was enjoying it like anything.</p>
<p>I am not an American, and I don't know your American slang. But you people would have gone up to that lady and insulted her. But I just walked in the street, staying as far from the sidewalk as I could. It was very difficult.</p>
<p>From the spiritual point of view, a dog symbolises faithfulness. If a dog bites you, they say that you have lost faith. When have I lost my faith? No, I have not lost it. It was just an attack by the hostile forces. They can act through a dog also. So a dog is supposed to be a divine instrument, but it can be very undivine as well. Here I am having such a serious problem, and the woman is enjoying it.</p>
<p>People should not run in the street. If they do, a dog will come from a house and create such problems! Out of the blue they come, some times three or four at a time. Some bark beforehand and some do not.</p>
<p>Almost every day I have problems at various places with dogs.</p>

<p>It was drizzling, and I was running back slowly along the same road where the dog had attacked me earlier. An old lady, over seventy years old, was standing on the sidewalk. Her umbrella was a plastic garbage bag. When she saw me she shouted, "Hey, stop!"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "O God, another old lady!" But I am obedient, so I stopped. There was a red light there, and I enjoyed stopping and resting at the red light. Sometimes even at a green light I enjoy rest.</p>
<p>The old lady said to me, "Do you know the Grand Central Parkway?"</p>
<p>I said, "Isn't the Grand Central right here?"</p>
<p>She said, "No! What do you know?"</p>
<p>There were many cars coming by and she asked me, "Can you come with me?" I thought that she was asking me to carry her bag, so I said, "I will gladly carry it."</p>
<p>I was observing her to see if she was really crazy. I felt sorry for her. Perhaps she felt sorry for me. When I took her to the other side of the Grand Central, she just stood there. I didn't know if anything was going on inside her mind. She was not smiling, but at least she didn't scold me.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was running past the bus stop on 150th Street. A black man and a white woman were standing there waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>Because of the construction there, I can't run very fast and I always have to go from one side of the road to the other. When the lady saw me, she said, "Good going! You're going so fast."</p>
<p>The man said, "No, he's not. I could have run much faster when I was his age."</p>
<p>The lady said, "No, you couldn't have."</p>
<p>Poor man, he was jealous of my running ability.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, in the morning, I had covered about two miles when a car with a little girl and her father approached me. The man said, "Look, look, Sri Chinmoy is running!" When the child looked outside the window, she was so delighted and excited to see me running.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later I was running near Bohack. Very slowly a car came toward me and finally stopped. A black lady and a black man were inside the car. The black lady was driving. She said to me, "Hi, Sri Chinmoy. You are running, you are running!"</p>
<p>One minute later another car with two middle-aged men slowly drove by. The driver asked me where a particular street was. I said, "Sorry, I do not know."</p>
<p>The man said, "Damn you." So I said, "Thank you."</p>

<p>Five minutes later I was running on the street where the Greek school is — the one which leads to Agni Press. As I was running, I passed a young girl of sixteen or seventeen who was riding a bike. She came up to me and said, "Hi, Sri Chinmoy." She was smiling and smiling. Then for about 150 metres she rode beside me, and then she pedalled away quite fast.</p>
<p>When I came up to Agni Press, I saw her talking to a few of her friends, some boys. As soon as I came by, they all started shouting my name, and clapping and jumping with such cheerfulness. They were cheering me at every step: "Sri Chinmoy! Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>When I got home I asked one of my disciples to bring me twelve apples and twelve oranges immediately. But he didn't hear the word "immediately." Twenty minutes passed and I said, "By this time those divine children will have disappeared." So I asked another disciple to drive me in the car. Then I saw the first disciple. He was walking very slowly. I said, "What are you doing? I asked you to come 'immediately'." He said, "Guru, I didn't hear the word 'immediately', I just heard 'go and bring'."</p>
<p>Anyway, I went to the spot to see if those children were still there. To my great surprise, the girl was sitting on the steps in front of the Greek School, with a friend of hers. Since both of them were girls, I didn't think it would be proper to go and speak to them. "Best thing is for us to go to Guru Stationery and bring some girls," I said. So we brought back two girl disciples who were working there to the spot where the two girls were talking.</p>
<p>When the girl saw our car approaching her, she stood up and jumped towards the car. "Sri Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy," she said. She and her friend were both jumping for joy.</p>
<p>I said to them, "Can I give you some fruits?"</p>
<p>The girl who was then standing beside the car said, "Of course. You are such a sweet, nice man. Can I kiss you on your hand?"</p>
<p>I said, "Oh, no!" I gave them each an orange and an apple. Then I asked, "Where are your friends?"</p>
<p>They said, "We'll go look for them." They went into the school, but their friends were not there. When they came out, the other girl said how happy she was to see me running. She was also a runner, and she said that she had run in one of our ten-mile races in Connecticut. She had come into Guru Health Foods that morning to ask when our next race would be. Both girls were excited.</p>
<p>I asked if they would see their friends soon, so they could give them apples and oranges, but they said, "No, we will not see them." I said, "Then I would like to give you again another orange and apple."</p>
<p>A young boy was watching the scene. He was not one of those who had cheered me, but he said, "Can I also have an orange? I don't care for apples, however." He came up to me all excited, and I gave him an orange.</p>
