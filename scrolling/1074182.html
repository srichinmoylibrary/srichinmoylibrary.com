<h2>The Fairy world: conversation on a birthday</h2>

<p><em>On the morning of R’s birthday on 31 March 1974, Sri Chinmoy concentrated on R’s third eye and told her that he would enable her to see a fairy that day. The following conversation took place that morning, after Sunday morning meditation at the Master’s house.</em></p>
<p>I have brought three fairies here. They are all the time playing inside the house, doing all kinds of things. I have told them to let you view them during the day or at night. They will listen to me. You don’t have to do a thing. I am giving you the receptivity so that you can see them today. I don’t believe in boons and all that, but today I am giving you a boon. And others also can see the fairy world today. But if you don’t see, what can I do? I cannot force receptivity.</p>
<p>I see right now in front of me three fairies who are playing, jumping near your left shoulder. I have kept your third eye open, only this opening of your third eye and the opening of my third eye are a little different. God is very, very bad. It takes such a long time to realise Him, and He says that He is very close to us, dear to us. All kinds of things He tells, but when it is a matter of realizing Him, He shuts the door for us. Even for us to see a fairy He won’t allow. (laughter)</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I see you right now, is it my imagination? It is so vivid. The fairy world, like other worlds, is also a reality. You can either enter into these worlds or these worlds can enter into you. Only then will these worlds be a reality for you. I say that I was born in India and that such a place exists. Your mind will believe this to some extent, because you have studied about India in school. But when it is a matter of India’s becoming a real reality for you, then you have to see the place. Here also, the fairy world one can really see. But unfortunately my disciples are not blessed with that capacity. It is not at all necessary to use the third eye. If one can have a childlike consciousness, the consciousness of a three-year-old, then one can easily see the fairy world. For that world is a children’s world; it is not the world of grownups and mature individuals. So you can use either your third eye or you can use your innocence and simplicity to see the fairy world. Again, if you can remain in my consciousness for even two minutes, you will definitely see it. So this is not a mental hallucination. The fairy world is a reality.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Where are the younger ones? You people are all grownups. The mind is operating very nicely, very nicely, in all of you. Nobody here is in the child’s consciousness. You are all trying to work with your minds. Otherwise, in minutes you would see the fairy world.</p>
<p>This is all lack of receptivity. There is one disciple I was blessing on his birthday. For seven years I had been trying, but there was nothing, no receptivity. If receptivity does not come even on his birthday, then, Oh God, what am I going to do? So I had to use force. Then, after six or seven minutes, I was able to give him what I really wanted to give him. But it is very bad to use force. If you keep your heart’s door closed, if you keep all your windows and doors closed, then how will the sunlight come in? It is the nature of sunlight to enter into us; but if the windows are closed, then the sunlight cannot come. Again, sunlight is very powerful, and in some way it will enter. Force you can use, but that is very wrong. Sometimes it can damage the individual.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our difficulty is that if we don’t see a thing every day, then we won’t be convinced. If we see something once, then we will only interpret it as imagination. Twenty times we have to see; only then will the human mind become convinced that a thing does exist or does not exist. Otherwise, we think, “How is it that I am not seeing it at once if it really exists? If it really existed for forty years, what have I been doing? I would have seen it.” If we see it only once, still we can deny its authenticity. Our difficulty is the mind. Only if we see something twenty times do we feel that it is real. The first time we see something, we feel it is all hallucination because others have not seen it. But if I have a mango, then whether others believe it or not does not matter. It is their problem. I have got it and I have eaten it. It is all inside me. Where is the proof? The proof is inside me. It is in the taste. It is in my satisfaction. The real proof is in my satisfaction: not your satisfaction, but my satisfaction.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, you won’t understand their language, but you can hear it with the subtle ear. Again, you can get it with the third eye. Many times the third eye gets the voice infinitely sooner than the ear. It is not a language with words. The language they use is light. The message is in the light. They can sing and do everything through light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Disciple: Y saw a fairy once.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Disciple: Y saw a fairy once." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Y:</em> Well, I don’t think it was actually a fairy. It was in the old Connecticut Centre. Downstairs, in the living room, as you looked towards the altar on the right hand side, was a dresser. I think a statue of Guru’s head was on top of this dresser. It was four feet high. I was sitting in the ante room and I couldn’t see the altar itself, because I was too much to the side. I was looking at the dresser, and I was sort of half asleep, perhaps, or not in a completely awake consciousness, when I saw something very small. It appeared to be a girl wearing something long. I immediately got the feeling that it wasn’t anything of great importance; it was just some little being coming there and looking to see what was going on. But immediately my mind came forward, and said something like, “Is that an angel?” And when that happened, it disappeared.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the highest point of view, it is not at all essential to see a fairy. Not at all. You have to know that the world of fairies is a world that cannot be higher than this world. No. In this world you will realise God. You will not only realise God; you will actually become God. That is God’s Dream. Look at a fairy. It is just like a child! Compare the fairy’s capacity to your capacity, when it will be all blossomed. Even your present achievement cannot be inferior to the achievement of the fairy world, not to speak of your future capacity one hundred or one thousand years from now. The fairy world is a delicate, sweet, childlike world. It is like children playing in the garden. You get joy. But when you think of the children’s capacity, it is very limited. Their capacity is to give us joy. They are moving around; they are playing, dancing, singing, and that gives us joy. But when it is a matter of real accomplishment or achievement, it is a different thing.</p>
<p>So, in your case, what you saw was a fairy, not an angel. If you had seen an angel, your mind would not have said that it was of no importance. An angel is definitely of real importance. But again, it is not of infinite importance to see an angel. No, not at all. Still, when it is a matter of capacity, there is a tremendous difference between a fairy and an angel. Angels can do many things. In the Bible they do all kinds of miracles. These stories are true. Fairies cannot do these things. They are children. Fairies can give you joy, they can give you inspiration, they can give you enthusiasm and make you feel that you are a child.</p>
<p>So, what you saw was not an angel. But you were right when you said not to use the mind. While you are eating a mango, if your mind comes to the fore and says, “After all, it is not so important to eat a mango,” then the taste that the mango embodies, you will not be able to get. While eating something, if you say, “It is not essential,” then whatever little taste or capacity the thing has, you won’t get it. If you are doing something or feeling something or trying to achieve something, if you immediately say, “It is not so important,” then the capacity or wealth of that particular thing, you will not get to the fullest. Even if the capacity that it has is eager to come into you, still you will not get it. Let us say that I am giving you a flower with utmost love. I am giving you a flower, but I have much more than a flower.</p>
<p>Today I am giving you a flower to see how much devotion you have for me. If you take it with utmost joy, then tomorrow you will get something more, because the thing that I wanted to give you, you have taken with utmost joy, gratitude, love and delight. I came to you in the form of a flower and you have accepted me. Then, tomorrow, I will come to you in the form of a lion. But if you do not accept me in the form of flower, then I will hesitate to come to you in the form of something infinitely more meaningful.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Fairies give joy: inner joy, outer joy. They give joy to sweet, innocent people through dreams. Sometimes, during meditation, they dance around. On a limited scale, they can fulfil wishes. They are always happy. They don’t create any problems. They are divine to some extent. We have disciples who are very well-liked by the fairies.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Disciple: Are fairies cute?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Disciple: Are fairies cute?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some look cute, but sometimes they look clumsy. Right now with my third eye I am seeing some fairies which are not beautiful. Just because they are like cute children, we like them. No matter what children wear, say or do, we like them. Sometimes, the way the fairies dress, they are very untidy and unclean. Of course, we feel this only when we are using our purity-heart to see them and judge them.</p>
<p>If we see an angel, our whole being will be swimming in a sea of delight. But if we see a fairy, we may get an altogether different experience. At times the fairies are quite restless and, like human beings, they have a tendency to quarrel and fight and adopt undivine means. This can create a headache in the innocent human observer. Again, many fairies are good, like good human beings. These fairies undoubtedly give enormous delight to the human observer.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually fairies like many colours. They like gaudy clothes, all different colours: green, red, black. But angels don’t like gaudy colours. They like subtle, ethereal, delicate colours. Their beauty is very ethereal, simple, shining. If you see an angel, you really feel something. But if you see a fairy, it is like going and mixing with a child.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A few days ago, on our way back from Washington D.C., we went to a service station to buy chocolate. I was outside the car. Two young American men came out. They were looking at me with utmost contempt, but I was smiling at them. One was a bad fairy and the other was a good fairy. Bad and good were mixing together. If the good one had seen me alone, perhaps his reaction would have been different. But because he was with the bad one, they both looked at me with contempt.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The world that the fairies live in does not follow the process of evolution. Therefore, fairies do not and cannot evolve and they do not feel the necessity of coming into the world in different incarnations. Again, fairies don’t die. If they want to dissolve and end their fairy life, they can do so.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On very rare occasions it can. Every rule admits of exceptions. Otherwise, usually it is the other way around. From the fairy world, fairies will take human incarnation because they see the limitations of their own world. But this also is rare. Fairies or angels see that human beings have more capacity because human beings can pray, they can meditate, they can realise God.</p>
<p>In Puerto Rico, one of our disciple’s granddaughters was a beautiful fairy. After she died, she went back to the fairy world. Fairies come to the human world and think that they will change their fate. But usually they don’t like it, so they go back to the fairy world where they will be happy again.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are. Only they are not trying to become one with God consciously, like the human beings who want to realise God. They are happy with what they have and what they are. It is not necessary for them to realise God.</p>
