<h2>The Guru and the hostile forces</h2>

<p>While I was standing in front of you today during the meditation and I was about to bless you in the inner world, there was a tremendous attack. A very strong hostile force was going to attack my dearest X. While I was looking at him I noticed this. Immediately I took that force into myself for a few seconds and then I threw it into the Universal Consciousness.</p>
<p>I tell you people, unless one is fully realised, one should not accept any disciple or play the part of a Guru. The force was following X, but immediately I took it because he is so dedicated, so devoted, so close. I took it here and then I threw it into the Universal Consciousness. That power I have. And where is the Universal Consciousness? It is in my possession. But if somebody else had tried to deal with that force, he would immediately have fainted or done something extremely frightening. Please forgive me, I am only telling you people that to deal with disciples without being fully realised is to make the greatest mistake. Also, it is a great injustice to the disciples.</p>
<p>Very often, when I stand in front of some of the disciples, consciously or unconsciously they hurl arrows at me. If you entered into the inner world, you would see that my whole body is bleeding profusely. Actually, I swim in a sea of blood. I do it but immediately I have the power to throw all these arrows into the Universal Consciousness. If I did not have the power, by this time I would have been in the other world. All the spiritual Masters must have this power if they have accepted disciples in the true sense. If they have not accepted any spiritual disciples, if they have only accepted human beings as members of their organisation, then they can have thousands and millions of followers and there is no responsibility on their part.</p>
<p>Many times, before a disciple is about to be attacked, the force comes and strikes me as hard as possible. Why? Because my identification, my oneness with the disciple is so thick. It is just like when somebody wants to strike the child in front of the mother, because the child has done something wrong. Immediately the mother comes and says, "l know that my child has done something wrong, but don't beat my child. He is mine. Beat me instead." In my case also, I do the same for my spiritual children. But this is only true of those who have accepted me fully and unreservedly. Otherwise, in spite of my best intentions, the Supreme will not allow me to do anything for you.</p>

<p>God-realisation is not an easy task. Some of the disciples who were with the Buddha, the Christ, Sri Krishna, still have not realised God. It entirely depends on the Supreme's Grace and the seeker's capacity. Speed is necessary and God's Grace is necessary: from above, Grace, and from below, speed. If one prays and meditates sincerely for twenty or thirty years, that doesn't mean he will be able to realise God. It entirely depends on God's Grace and the individual's capacity and receptivity. Just because here some of my disciples will stay with me to the end does not mean they will run the fastest. Do you think all my disciples will realise God in this incarnation? I will be glad if I get one or two or three. God-realisation is a most difficult thing. It is not the number of years you spend with a Master, but how fast you can run.</p>
<p>It is not that they don't have an intense cry. An intense inner cry you can have, but the only thing is, how long can you maintain the intense cry? Early in the morning for an hour you maintain an intense cry. Then, if you go to our press to print my books, your intense cry goes away. Jealousy may start or other wrong forces may start. Afterwards in two hours' time, your consciousness starts descending, descending, descending, descending.</p>
<p>I can't deny your morning's intensity. But how long do you maintain it? If you can't remain meditating for five hours, then for four hours you enjoy real vacation, relaxation. A seven-hour meditation we had recently. Out of seven hours, there were some who did not meditate for seven minutes. They were glued to their seats but they were thinking of their breakfast or of all kinds of divine things. At the time you think they are meditating for seven hours, but you don't have occult vision. They are thinking of their breakfast, their boyfriends, their girlfriends. But when you look at them, you feel those people are most devoted. You say, "How I wish to be like that." But what is in their mind, God alone knows. Some elderly women stood up once to meditate. The audience was so moved. They never saw elderly women doing such wonderful meditation. But what was going on in their minds? Tomorrow morning's breakfast and how they have pleased their husbands and what they are going to wear. But everybody thought they did the best meditation because of the way they looked.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Master&#039;s physical presence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Master&#039;s physical presence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I am on earth, in the physical, it is the greatest opportunity for the disciples. In one incarnation you can make the progress of forty or fifty incarnations. Here, if you are depressed, if you need me, I can console you. But when I go to the other world, it will be infinitely more difficult. Then, if you are depressed, you will have to telephone me. But that telephone call is so expensive; the price is called aspiration.</p>
<p>When the physical goes away, it is difficult. Why do disciples of other Masters come to me for progress? Because they are unable to keep their contact with their Master. They enter into ignorance and then they do not hear their Master's voice. When the Master is in front of them, talking in a human language, it is so easy to hear him. Whether they want to abide by the Master's dictates is another matter. But if the Master wants to speak from the top of the tree, from the other world, the disciples don't hear because he is very far away At the foot of the tree he is using a human language, but at the top of the tree he is using some other language which is very different.</p>
<p>When the Master leaves the body, then he can take a little rest. At that time if his children and grandchildren are fighting what can he do? But now I cannot take any rest. I am shouting and barking. When the mother is sleeping, the children go out and strike each other. But when the mother is awake, then the children have to behave.</p>
<p>When the Master is in the physical, you may doubt him. "How is it that he insults us and scolds us?" Then, when the Master leaves, you forget the physical and suddenly you have tremendous faith. But that faith lasts only for two days or two months. Only a few disciples will miss the Master's physical presence to such an extent that they will want to leave the world when he leaves. They will feel that they cannot function without the Master's physical presence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Transformation of the seeker&#039;s consciousness</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Transformation of the seeker&#039;s consciousness" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>I wish to tell you that when you enter into the spiritual life, very often you see that the play of the vital world or your subconscious life comes to the fore and your mind becomes full of filthy, dirty thoughts and ugly ideas. Now what happens? You feel, "Oh, I was far better before I accepted the spiritual life. These thoughts did not appear in those days. I came into the spiritual life in order to have a better life, a life of joy success and progress, How is it that instead of making progress, I have once more become miserable? Such uncomely thoughts keep coming to the fore!"</p>
<p>I always say that the past is dust. But if the past looms large and comes to stand in front of you with its imperfections limitations and bondage, do not be afraid. Do not be afraid of your imperfect lower nature, This is the last blow that your vital wants to offer you. You should feel that on the strength of your genuine acceptance of your Master, he has taken full responsibility or your emotional life, your vital life, your sex life.</p>
<p>If you have accepted your spiritual Master really and truly, then he is bound to take your imperfections, your vital and emotional turmoil from you. He has the capacity and also he has been commissioned by God to do this. He hasn't come into the world to take only your aspiration and your divine qualities. He has come to transform your undivine qualities as well as to augment your divine qualities.</p>
<p>Some people have accepted their Master only in name. They say, "Oh, I have a Master," and then they enter into emotional life, the life of enjoyment with the feeling, "My Master will take the responsibility.' I wish to say that this is wrong .You cannot live a double life: coming to the Master to give him your life of devotion and going home or elsewhere to enjoy animal life. The Master is helpless if a seeker cherishes the animal life. This animal life has to be thrown into the Master's transcendental Consciousness if the seeker really wants to be purified. In that Consciousness the Master is not the body; he is the supreme Self.</p>
<p>If you feel that your undivine qualities are not being transformed, you cannot blame your Master. It is you who are not offering your undivine qualities to your Master. You are ashamed to offer them; you want to hide them. But this is the wrong attitude. You have to think of yourself as a child. A child is dearest to his mother precisely because he is like an open book to her. His very nature may be to go out and play and become dirty, but when his hands are dirty and he has sand all over his body he comes running to his mother. Then she embraces him and cleans him so that he becomes pure again. But if the child thinks that he has to be pure in order to approach his mother, then he will never become pure.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life it is the same. If the seeker has a Master, he has to be fully prepared to throw his emotional world into the Master's highest Consciousness. He cannot feel that he will keep his emotional life apart from his spiritual life. He has to give what he has and what he is. If he is creating divine qualities, let us say aspiration, that is wonderful. He is offering his aspiration to his Master. But if for some time he is wanting in aspiration, this state of consciousness he has also to offer consciously to the Master. If he can't meditate well one day and if he feels miserable, then that miserable condition he has to offer to the Master. And if he is successful in his meditation, then the joy that he gets he also has to offer. When one jumps into the vast ocean, one jumps with all that one has even if a particular limb or part of the body is full of darkness and filth. When both your success and your failure immediately come to me spiritually, you will be the happiest person on earth.</p>
<p>So if you want to be totally pure and if you really want to be identified inseparably with me, you have to give both your divine qualities and your undivine qualities to me. You can become one with me because I have consciously and soulfully told you that you have every right to consider me as your very own. I have given you my soulful promise that I have accepted you wholeheartedly and you also have given me your soulful promise that you have accepted me wholeheartedly. So you have to give me what you have: imperfection, ignorance and vital life. Let your possessions in the vital world, in the mental world or in any other inner world of yours be mine. You will see that where transformation is necessary, your Master will do it; where the increase of divine qualities is necessary, your Master will do it. Your Master will do everything. He will multiply the divine qualities into infinity and the undivine qualities he will transform into divine qualities. But this I can do only on the strength of your real and implicit acceptance of me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of you have an inner fear that you may one day leave the Centre because of depression or other wrong forces. But where will your Guru be at that time? Do you think he will be snoring? No. Even at the last moment, even if you actually leave our boat, if your soul pleads with me, "Bring my body back," I can do so. And even if this doesn't happen, your soul will maintain its connection with me forever.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if you have been with us for, say, five years and the body is constantly revolting against the soul's decisions, the soul may become disgusted. The soul may say, "I have tried to transform you, illumine you. Now wait; wait for God's Eternity, wait indefinitely." If the soul is disgusted, then you have to wait. At that time there is no hope although the person could have benefited from being with me. But when there is no revolt, then don't worry; there is no chance, no possibility of your leaving our Centre. And even if you go, your soul would bring you back. It depends on the soul's eagerness, the soul's need.</p>
<p>You may be far from God-realisation but some of you have made twenty incarnations progress by staying with me. Even though you are still far from illumination, if you had not accepted the spiritual life, the progress you have made, I assure you, would have remained a far cry. These things will be proved by your own soul's realisation. When you get illumination, you will see what your past would have been like if you had not accepted a spiritual path, any path. My disciples feel an affinity for our boat. It is our mutual love, our feeling of mutual oneness that keeps us together.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I came to America. I was inwardly commanded by my inner Pilot to come to the West and serve Him in the aspiring Western souls. Since then, I have been trying to serve Him according to the capacity He has kindly granted me. I have given talks at over one hundred fifty universities with only one intention and that intention was to offer my dedicated service to the young generation. At the university, the students usually get the knowledge that helps the mind. But the knowledge of the mind does not lead us very far. It is only the wisdom of the heart that leads us to the highest and the deepest realities of life.</p>
<p>We have a path called love, devotion and surrender. This love is divine love. This devotion is divine devotion. This surrender is divine surrender. The difference between human love and the divine love is this: human love wants to possess. But before it possesses, unfortunately it is itself possessed. Divine love wants only to serve and illumine. And while serving and illumining, it is equally served and illumined. Human devotion is nothing short of attachment. Divine devotion is our intensity for the fulfilment of a divine cause.</p>
<p>Human surrender is a forced surrender. It is the surrender of a slave to his master. Divine surrender is a spontaneous surrender. It is the surrender of the lover to his beloved. Here the God-lover is the seeker in us; here the beloved is the Absolute Supreme.</p>
<p>I am also fortunate to be connected with the I United Nations. Twice a week I offer my devoted service to the soul and the body of the United Nations. There, some of the members of the United Nations join me in my prayer and meditation. We are all spiritual seekers. We are trying to bring about world peace in a spiritual way, in the way we are well familiar with. The diplomats and delegates want to bring about world peace in their own dedicated way, the way that is known to them. Our way is the inner way. Their way is the outer way. Both the ways are equally effective. One way is to climb down the tree, the other way is to climb up the tree. A climber has to know how to climb up and how to climb down. If he cannot climb up, he will not be able to collect the fruits. If he cannot climb down, then he will not be able to distribute the fruits to hungry humanity.</p>
<p>What a seeker needs is satisfaction. But unless and until he has satisfied his countless brothers and sisters of the world, he can never be totally satisfied. So his own divine satisfaction and God-manifestation on earth go together.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the distinction between the vital and the physical?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The physical as such is blind and very limited. By nature, the physical is lethargic; it doesn't want to budge an inch. The vital is sometimes dynamic and sometimes aggressive. The vital very rarely will take rest. And the vital rarely cares for inner light. It is like a mad elephant. When the spiritual light enters into the vital, if the vital is not ready to receive, the vital will be crushed, broken to pieces.</p>
<p>But when the vital receives some of the soul's light, or when it has surrendered to some extent to the soul's dictates, it will undoubtedly have some purification. And that vital, instead of standing in the way of God-realisation, will help considerably. It will serve the soul in accelerating its onward journey.</p>
<p>There is the vital proper and there is the physical vital. The physical vital is inside the body and, at the same time, around the body. This is the vital that is deeply connected with the gross physical. But the vital proper is not part and parcel of the body. It is in the body, but it has its own independent existence. It is like the difference between the mind proper and the physical mind. The physical mind is in the physical acting the way the physical wants, whereas the mind proper has its own existence. Similarly, the vital proper will never be identified with the physical vital, The vital proper we use only when we try to fulfil a great aim or great mission on earth. Mighty kings and potentates are usually born with that kind of vital. Great leaders-not the so-called political leaders, but leaders of mankind-are born with that kind of vital proper, dynamic vital.</p>
<p>The physical can easily be distinguished from the vital, because the physical, by nature, will not open. It is like a blind child. It does not want to aspire. Constantly we have to feed the physical as we feed a child. But this physical eventually begins to aspire and it becomes proud of its inner reality. The physical is the cage and inside is the soul, the bird. When the cage, the outer body, becomes conscious of the fact that it has an invaluable treasure inside it, then it tries to exert its own power to help the soul, the heart, the mind and the vital in their combined aspiration and in their combined efforts to fulfil God's Will.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sometimes we use the term 'vital energy.' But the vital proper is a sheath. It is an inner sheath. When we say mind proper, it is a mental sheath that we are speaking of. When we say the physical, it is the physical sheath. When we speak of the vital after death, we have to say that the vital is a sheath.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the gross physical have more power than the vital?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the gross physical have more power than the vital?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The gross physical has inertia. This matter does not aspire. When you go very high, into deepest meditation, if you happen to see that the physical is cooperating, well and good. At that time it becomes part and parcel of the soul itself. Otherwise, it will be like a dead body, a corpse, and it is just a heavy load. The Light is descending, descending. But the lowest is the physical, and here the Light finds it extremely difficult to operate. The physical is the last obstacle to the descent of Light.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the difference between vital music and spiritual music?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the difference between vital music and spiritual music?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we play vital music, we starve our soul and feed our body. The creator is like the father and humanity is the child. When the creator plays vital music, the father is drinking something, but the son is starving for something else, for milk. But when the creator plays spiritual music, both the father and the son are drinking nectar at the same time. Even looking at the father's face, the child will be able to drink nectar. The very fact that the father is drinking nectar is enough for the child.</p>
<p>Soulful music is soft, subtle and delicate. It offers delight rather than vital excitement. Vital excitement is one thing and soul's delight is something else. The soul's delight is most powerful, most intense; but, at the same time, it does not create any kind of undivine, sensational pleasure in the body. It just transports; it carries the entire being into the Highest like a balloon and then, when the balloon breaks, you are swimming in the sea of Bliss.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: if someone wants to become your disciple, is it necessary to see the person&#039;s picture or actually see the person in the physical?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: if someone wants to become your disciple, is it necessary to see the person&#039;s picture or actually see the person in the physical?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not at all necessary. When a person wants to become my disciple, it means a portion of his soul is hovering around me. When it is time for me to decide on the physical plane about this particular person, immediately his soul will appear before me. That is why when I go through the seekers' pictures, sometimes I flip through very quickly without even pausing. It is because the soul appears before me and it is not necessary for me to concentrate on the picture. Sometimes, though, it is not the soul but the mind or the vital or the heart that wants to become my disciple. Then I have to concentrate for a second or two to bring the soul, so I can see if the person is meant to follow my path or not.</p>
<p>The reason I ask seekers to send in a picture is for the human aspect. If they think that I want to see their picture, then they feel that I care about them. It helps to convince their mind and makes them feel more familiar with me. But to be frank, it is not at all necessary.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Either by diving deep within or by crying most soulfully, we can get in touch with the life-producing, life-transforming, life- illumining and life-fulfilling energy. A seeker either has to go deep within and touch the inmost recesses of his consciousness or he has to bring to the fore his inmost cry.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I read once that we have more than two eyes. Is that true?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I read once that we have more than two eyes. Is that true?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, there are seven major eyes. You know about the two eyes. Then, between the eyebrows and slightly above is the third eye. Of all the eyes, this third eye is most powerful, most effective. With the third eye we can see the past, present and future. Now, above the third eye there are two more eyes, in the crown centre. With these eyes one can read somebody else's mind. One of the eyes in the crown centre is the eye of identification. If you are totally identified with me, then everything that is in my mind you will be able to know. Then, if you go up and open the other eye that is in the crown centre, you will enter into infinite Peace and infinite Light. If you don't want to come back to this world of sorrow and suffering but only want to remain in infinite Peace, Light and Bliss, you have to open up this eye and stay there. There are also two eyes in the feet.</p>
<p>'Eye' means light. All the chakras are full of light, so whenever we open up a centre, we can say that we are opening up an 'eye'. Actually we have more than seven eyes. Wherever we have light, we have eyes. Spiritual Masters and occultists know that there is light at the tip of the finger. Many times a spiritual Master will use his finger to touch someone or something. He doesn't have to use his third eye or his physical eyes; just by touching, the Master can see the person or thing clearly. Spiritual Masters and occultists use all the eyes whenever it is possible.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to be extremely grateful to the Supreme for giving you the opportunity to teach children, for it means that you are being given the opportunity to become a child yourself. Now you are twenty-two or twenty-three, but your aim is to become a child, the eternal child, so that you can make constant progress in the spiritual life. If you are all the time grateful to the Supreme, then you can make the fastest progress.</p>
<p>When you teach children, do not think that you are serving them because the school authorities are paying you. No, you are serving them because you want to be another child. And there is also another reason that you serve them. When they offer you a smile, feel that this smile immediately comes from the Supreme. Each time a child smiles, it is the expansion of God's Dream-Reality on earth. So, if you remember that, then you will try to serve the Supreme most soulfully and constantly.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to go deep within. Right now you are a beginner. Every day you have to go deep within in order to know. Today you dig one inch, then tomorrow it will be two inches, the day after tomorrow, three inches. The deeper you go, the clearer your vision will be. If your aspiration is intense, easily you will be able to know what the Supreme wants you to do in your outer life.</p>
