<p>At four in the afternoon, after running a half-mile, I stopped for two seconds in front of an old man, an invalid who was sitting in a wheelchair in front of his house.</p>
<p>He said to me, "Don't stop, don't stop! It is not allowed. Keep going, keep going. Don't stop, it is not allowed."</p>
<p>I thanked him, and then I ran a mile and a half. When I was returning, I thought that the old man would still be there and give me the same advice. So about 100 metres before his house, I stopped for a few seconds and thought of him. Immediately I saw a flash and heard him say in the inner world, "That's perfect."</p>
<p>When I saw him 100 metres later, I smiled and he said, "That's perfect." He didn't know that I had stopped 100 metres before.</p>

<p>After I had run about two miles and was near my tennis court, I saw an old lady who had just mowed her lawn. Leaves and grass were lying on the sidewalk. When I was about to run by, she said to me, "Please run softly and gently. Don't make a mess!" When I heard this, I immediately jumped into the street. "Such a nice guy!" she said.</p>

<p>When I was running the day before yesterday, I felt such tiredness in my body. The body was so undivine, not receptive at all. After 200 metres, I stopped for no rhyme or reason. After 400 metres, again I stopped. This time I got mad at myself. "Is it tiredness or is it something else?" I asked.</p>
<p>Inwardly I said a few times, "I am not going to stop, I am not going to stop." Then I began chanting out loud, at every step, "No, never! No, never! No, never!" In this way I covered one mile. If people had heard me chanting in the street, they would have said: "Insane!" Luckily, no one was around. Then I ran all the way back home, feeling quite happy.</p>

<p>Early yesterday morning around seven o'clock, as I was running towards Parsons Boulevard, I saw an elderly man sitting on a chair across the street. As I came by he raised his hand and said to me, "Hey, your style is beautiful. You look beautiful. You are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!"</p>
<p>When I came back from running around 7:30, one of the disciples came to my house to drive me to the playground. As soon as she opened the door and saw me on the porch she said, "Guru, you look so beautiful!" She used the same words as the old man. So in silence I blessed the soul of my laundress for my beautiful outfit.</p>

<p>In the afternoon at three o'clock I was running along the street near the turn-off to Guru Stationery. Many children were coming home from school at that time.</p>
<p>A little girl, eight or nine years old, said to a little boy, "Look, look, Shry is running!"</p>
<p>The boy said, "His name is Sri."</p>
<p>The girl said, "He runs like an old man."</p>
<p>The boy said, "He is not old."</p>
<p>The girl said, "But he runs like an old man."</p>

<p>After I had run 400 metres more, I saw a group of boys standing opposite one of my disciples' houses. One white boy was so excited to see me running. "Oh, Sri Chinmoy!" he said.</p>
<p>A black boy said, "No good, he takes away everybody's money."</p>
<p>The white boy said, "No, my father said he is a saint like our Christian saints. He never charges any money."</p>
<p>I didn't want to enter into their conversation, so I just kept going.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The missing water bottle</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The missing water bottle" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At night, one of my disciples was driving us along the route where one of my spiritual daughters, A., was going to run thirteen miles the next morning, so we could leave bottles of water there. She was saying that she wanted to get rid of all her old running shoes. Another of my spiritual daughters, B., who was in the car with us, said, "Why do you have to get rid of them? There will be many people to buy them." But she used some American slang expression.</p>
<p>A. said, "Nobody will buy my shoes."</p>
<p>B. said, "Why don't you give them to Casey to sell in his flea market? People will be happy to buy running shoes at a cheap price."</p>
<p>A. put bottles of water at the three-mile, five-mile and six-mile marks. On the bottles it was written, "This bottle is for a runner. Please do not remove!" or something like that.</p>
<p>The next morning A. was supposed to start running at six o'clock. At five o'clock I was out running along the same route. A little before the three mile mark, I said to myself, "Let me go and see whether the bottle is still there." I knew she had put it near the sidewalk at the base of a drinking fountain. I stopped there to look, but the bottle was not there. "Wonderful, wonderful" I thought sadly. "Somebody has removed it."</p>
<p>I was about to start running again on the street when one of my inner beings said, "My Lord, please run on the sidewalk." I didn't ask why. After 100 metres, right at the 1,500-metre mark on the sidewalk, I saw the bottle standing straight up. Someone had removed the bottle and put it on the sidewalk. Had my inner being not asked me to run on the sidewalk, I would not have seen the bottle since it was quite dark.</p>
<p>I picked up the bottle and ran back to put it in the original place. Then I continued my run.</p>

<p>At the four-mile mark I saw a middle-aged, innocent looking lady in trouble. She was having problems with her Volkswagen and had opened the hood. She said, "Can you give me a hand?"</p>
<p>O God, I know nothing about cars. I said, "I know nothing about mechanics, but please wait. In ten minutes I will be able to send you my chauffeur." She didn't understand my English, so I said, "My driver, my driver."</p>
<p>Then I began running quite fast to look for a telephone booth to call the disciple who drives me around. After 200 metres, I saw an ambulance driver asleep in his ambulance. As soon as I passed him he woke up and said, "Hey, such a beautiful, cool morning. Don't you know how to enjoy sleep? You woke me up."</p>
<p>I said, "Friend, can you do me a favour? A girl is having trouble with her car."</p>
<p>He said, "Pretty girl?"</p>
<p>I said, "Middle-aged lady." This man was a real joker. I never carry money when I run, but this time I happened to have seven dollars with me. I gave him the money, and the seven dollars talked. He immediately turned on the motor and made a wrong turn down a one-way street heading towards the lady. When I saw him finally talking to the lady, I said, "Now I have done my part. He is a joker, but he will fix her car." So I continued running.</p>

<p>Twenty metres away from the five-mile mark there was a parked police car with two policemen in it. One of them was asleep. The other one said to me, "Sir, how I wish I didn't have duty at this hour. Why don't you go and rest? Why do you have to run at this hour?"</p>
<p>I said, "I enjoy it."</p>
<p>He asked, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>I answered, "Somebody has put water at this spot to drink."</p>
<p>The policeman said, "Don't you want to drink it? Aren't you thirsty?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I am not thirsty."</p>
<p>"Go home and sleep," he said.</p>

<p>When I had run another mile and a half, I stopped for a second or two. Immediately a tiny dog came and sat by my right foot, wanting me to caress it and give it a little kindness. I never do this kind of thing, but this time I bent a little to touch the dog's head. The owner, who was bald-headed, wearing a grey coat, came over to me and said, "My Dolly has fallen in love with you."</p>
<p>I kept caressing the dog. The owner said, "Dolly, do you want to become a great runner like this gentleman?"</p>
<p>I said, "How I wish I could become a great runner!"</p>

<p>On my way back I wanted to see if the first bottle of water was still there. I was wearing my Pepsi Cola Bicycle Marathon hat and I put it under the bottle to see if my spiritual daughter A. would find it. Later, A. told me that some crazy person had put a hat under her water bottle and she had just left it there. Her intuition wasn't working. I didn't tell her whose hat it was.</p>

<p>The priest said, "Why not? All the time I see people like you running, running, running. Why don't you run inwardly? You don't believe in Heaven? By running in the street, do you think you will be able to go to Heaven?"</p>
<p>I was in a joking mood so I said to the priest, "I will find Heaven everywhere except inside your tongue."</p>
<p>He said, "Who are you, after all?"</p>
<p>"I am an ordinary man," I answered. "As you see, I am just a runner."</p>
<p>The priest said, "Why do you have to run?"</p>
<p>I said, "I am getting ready for the New York Marathon."</p>
<p>"You dark fool!" he shouted. "Look at your head, look at your head."</p>
<p>"It seems I have more hair than you," I said.</p>
<p>He said, "Like you, thousands and thousands of fools will be running in the New York Marathon. Go back to your running. I shall pray for your salvation."</p>
<p>I said, "Perhaps you need salvation more desperately than I do."</p>
<p>Then the priest swore again, "Damn you!" and crossed himself.</p>

<p>The journey to Greece, where I was going to run the marathon, took about nine hours. For me to sit for that long on a plane — especially with my right leg problems — was a difficult task. At one point, I got up to go to the bathroom. I was standing in line for about fifteen minutes but the line did not move. So very gently I was stretching my right leg while standing.</p>
<p>An elderly lady saw me and came up to me. "I am sure you are going for the marathon," she said. "Look, my husband too is going for the marathon."</p>
<p>Then she called her husband over and introduced me to him. I had a long talk with him. He came from Cleveland, and this was going to be his seventeenth marathon. Sixteen times he had run, but this was going to be his first time in Greece. He told me his time in his first marathon was 4:17. Now he does it in three hours or 3:15.</p>
<p>He was advising me to do hill work. "You must do hill work if you want to become a good runner. Nobody can become a good runner without doing hill work. If you want to increase your speed, if you want to strengthen your legs, if you want to have long strides, then hill work is the only answer."</p>
<p>I thanked him deeply.</p>

<p>Then, at the airport in Athens, a tall, fat gentleman came up to me and caught me by the shoulder.</p>
<p>He said, "Friend, are you going to run the marathon?" I smiled at him.</p>
<p>Then he said, "I am going to run. I come from Philadelphia."</p>
<p>I said, "Philadelphia gave me a very sad experience. I went to Philadelphia to run the marathon."</p>
<p>He said he was also there and gave up after thirteen miles. I said, "At twenty-one miles I gave up."</p>
<p>So in the same marathon where I gave up after twenty-one miles, he gave up after thirteen miles.</p>
<p>He had run one other marathon somewhere else, he told me; his timing was five and a half hours. So my ego came forward. I said, "I am not so bad." O God, in two more days what would happen!</p>
<p>Then we talked for a long time. Since my timing is a little better than his, I felt quite at ease talking to him.</p>
<p>Then the Cleveland man came up and joined our conversation. He was very sincere; he was not bragging, only advising us what to do.</p>
