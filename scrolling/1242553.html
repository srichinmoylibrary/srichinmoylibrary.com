 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Guru, many years ago I told you that my father had an unusual experience. You said that it was a very high experience, but my father did not value it. When somebody gets a very high experience like this from God, does God not know that the person might not be ready for it, or might not take it the right way?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some seekers pray to God again and again, “Give me a high experience.” God knows perfectly well that they may not use the experience properly. A little child begs and begs his mother to give him a dollar. The mother knows that her child is not going to use the money wisely or value it. Instead of buying some proper food with the dollar, perhaps the child will get some candy. Poor God, poor mother! Their children are begging and begging. To stop them from begging, God and the mother give their children what they want. But again, the children may not value it.</p>
<p>If God wants to give millions and billions of experiences to human beings, He will not look to see whether those particular individuals are going to use the experiences properly. Let us say I give you a mango. Either you can eat it all by yourself, or you can give pieces of the mango to others. I am not responsible at that time. In the same way, God is not responsible. Common sense says that if a high, lofty experience has descended upon someone from Above, that person will be so happy, so pleased, so thrilled. But sometimes, if you put something very beautiful and expensive, like jewellery, in front of a child, he feels that it has no value. He just grabs it and throws it away. Again, in the famous story about Hanuman, he saw that Lord Rama was not present in the locket he had received, so he threw it away. It was such an expensive locket, but he threw it away. This was Hanuman’s devotion to Lord Rama!</p>
<p>Many times people get high experiences, but they do not value them, they do not value them. Again, some people get simple, ordinary experiences, but they feel that those experiences are very high, from a very lofty region. They value those so-called minor experiences. Because they value the minor experiences, God becomes very pleased, and then He gives them very high experiences.</p>
<p>This world is so complicated! The day God created the world, complication began, because God created the mind, also. How many times do we use our heart to see the reality in its own way? Very rarely.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Who has been fully appreciated? Has anybody on earth been fully appreciated? Was the Saviour Jesus Christ fully appreciated? Will anybody who has the high, higher, highest vision be fully appreciated? God knows how many years it will take. Those individuals will be appreciated only long after the unimportant ones are appreciated.</p>
<p>The higher you go, the more you will be misunderstood. Appreciation comes from God, in the form of His Blessings.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, with seekers from established spiritual cultures whom we meet around the world, one of the most difficult things is to make them feel how our path is different from the traditional spirituality they were raised with. I am wondering if you could offer some advice.</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, with seekers from established spiritual cultures whom we meet around the world, one of the most difficult things is to make them feel how our path is different from the traditional spirituality they were raised with. I am wondering if you could offer some advice." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It will take time for some cultures to understand our yoga because they have their own way of thinking. Our path may be different from other paths, needless to say, but we will never say our goal is different from theirs — no! The Ultimate Goal is the same. Whether an individual follows Lord Buddha’s path, or Sri Ramakrishna’s path, or Sri Krishna’s path, the Ultimate Goal is always the same. But when we arrive at the goal, we may call that goal by different names. The goal is the same, but we may call it by any name, according to our liking.</p>
<p>First my name was Ganapati. Then it became Madal, then Chinmoy, Sri Chinmoy and, for my disciples, Guru. All those names refer to the same person. Like that, sometimes it happens that we arrive at the same goal, but we give different names to the goal.</p>
<p>Again, people may misunderstand our way. Those who live in the mind will often misunderstand. There were spiritual Masters of the highest order who did not write books, did not compose songs or poems, did not create thousands of paintings. In so many fields, specially with regard to physical fitness and exercise, other spiritual Masters did not take part, so it is very easy for people to misunderstand me.</p>
<p>People may say that other spiritual Masters meditate for hours and hours inside their rooms or in their own Himalayan caves. In my case, some people will say I am spending so many hours in all my outer activities, so when do I meditate? But these people will not understand, or will not even believe, that there is a kind of meditation which is called untiring, ceaseless meditation. There is such a stage. It is most difficult, unimaginably difficult to attain to that stage. Many, many spiritual Masters, even those of the highest order, could not attain to that stage. At that point the soul, or we can say the Inner Pilot, is constantly meditating. I meditate in front of the disciples, here and there. But inside me there is constant meditation, which nobody will be able to see. Who will be able to believe, even, what I am?</p>
<p>On the human level, sometimes, it takes a few minutes, half an hour or even hours for an individual to enter into his highest. You know what is your highest consciousness. Some people take a very long time, while others can reach that stage in the twinkling of an eye. Whether you believe it or not, in the twinkling of an eye I can go to my highest. Most of the time I am in my highest, but if I am not in my highest, even if I am chatting with the disciples, in a matter of a few seconds I can go to the highest.</p>
<p>We have not come into the world to prove anything. We have come into the world to complete a game in our own way — that is to say, the way the Supreme has chosen for us.</p>
<p>Some people believe in yoga. Some people believe that if you do <em>japa</em> millions of times, that is meditation. I never did <em>japa</em> in India — never! <em>Japa</em> my brother Mantu did. He repeated Lord Shiva’s name: “Shiv, Shiv, Shiv, Shiv, Shiv.” Here in America, two or three years ago I did some <em>japa</em>. Spiritual Masters of the highest order were inwardly saying, “What are you doing?” I said, “I want to do <em>japa</em> now. I did not do it in India, so now I am trying <em>japa</em>.” They said it was absolutely unnecessary for me.</p>
<p>Some spiritual Masters realised God in this incarnation, but your Guru, Sri Chinmoy, did not realise God only in this incarnation — no, no! Many, many, many years ago, hundreds of years ago, I attained my God-realisation. It was not in this incarnation. In this life, between the ages of thirteen and fourteen, I was revising my God-realisation-book. I was revising it very fast, very fast. Let us say somebody has studied a book and he knows everything in the book. After some time he reviews the book and brings everything to the fore very quickly.</p>
<p>In this incarnation also, in my early years, I meditated seriously for hours every day. I did not have any disciples at that time. I meditated for years at seven minutes past two in the morning. I started doing that after my Guru came to me inwardly every day for ten days or so to inspire me to get up at that time. I meditated in my room, I meditated in the street. While cycling I meditated. At home, while I was eating with my older brothers and sisters, I was also meditating. Sometimes I would recline with my legs up while eating, but my eldest brother, who specially deserved respect, did not mind how I was eating. My other family members also did not mind. That peculiar habit I have not given up: eating while lying down. Thousands of years ago also I did that.</p>
<p>Some seekers, some cultures have their own system. They say that if you pray, if you meditate, if you practise all kinds of disciplines, then you are spiritual. But I wish to say that spirituality is in consciousness. While walking, you can think of your breakfast or you can think of your enemies; you can think of anything. Again, while walking you can meditate. Sri Ramakrishna was often walking and meditating, mile after mile. He also meditated under the Panchavati tree. When Sri Aurobindo’s legs were in good condition, for six or seven hours he used to meditate while walking. Lord Buddha used to meditate while walking. Afterwards he meditated at the foot of the Bodhi tree. Every day Mahavira, while walking mile after mile, was meditating. There were many spiritual Masters who used to meditate while walking. In my case, while cycling also I did very good meditation.</p>
<p>God alone knows why, out of two thousand people or more, the Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram chose me to meditate in Sri Aurobindo’s room. To four or five disciples the Mother gave permission to meditate once a month in Sri Aurobindo’s room, on the first of the month. For three months we meditated. The leader of that group was so kind to me. He inspired me or compelled me to learn English metre. Today I know English metre and English poetry because he encouraged me to learn. One day he told me, “I have got permission from the Mother for you to meditate in Sri Aurobindo’s room.” I could not believe it. In the South Indian heat, from one o’clock to one-thirty we were supposed to meditate there. According to the Mother’s assistant, instead of meditating, some of us were fast asleep in the South Indian heat!</p>
<p>When the Mother heard this news, she withdrew her invitation to the group. But then she sent me a message: every day I must come and meditate. With that small group, once a month I meditated in Sri Aurobindo’s room for three months. Then the Mother’s assistant told me to come every morning to Sri Aurobindo’s door, to an important place where the Mother and Sri Aurobindo used to give <em>darshan</em>.</p>
<p>Again I am saying that my meditation is of a totally different type. Everybody’s meditation is unique in its own way. In our spiritual life, why should a garden have only one kind of flower? There should be other flowers. If one garden has roses plus other flowers, will somebody go to a garden where there is only a rose? That person will say, “No, I would like to have other flowers as well.” There are some stores where special things are sold, but why do we go to the supermarket? Because everything is there.</p>
<p>Alas, Swami Vivekananda had critics. Once he and his spiritual brothers were dancing while musical instruments were being played. They were dancing, dancing and dancing, and they were chanting very soulfully. Sri Chaitanya’s path is also like that. Singing and dancing, they go forward in the street. That is their style.</p>
<p>An American lady had given Swami Vivekananda a great deal of money. Some critics said to that American lady, “Look, look! What have you done? You gave him so much money, and now they are dancing! Indian meditation means to sit cross-legged and be very serious, one-pointed. Instead of that, Swami Vivekananda and his group are dancing here!”</p>
<p>This lady was a Westerner, but she also thought that Indian meditation had to be practised inside the Himalayan caves or in a closet, so she became upset. The critics convinced her that Indian meditation is meant to take place always inside a closet, with no public show.</p>
<p>Again, some spiritual figures are afraid of meditating in front of thousands of people. They feel that all the undivine forces, the lower vital forces of the audience will attack them, so the best thing is for them to meditate inside a small room. Alas, alas! People who are afraid of facing the world still have to deal with their own mind. They can remain in their room, but their mind, like a magnet, can invite millions of thoughts, unhealthy and unaspiring.</p>
<p>Some followers of Sri Krishna’s path here in America, in Russia and all over the world are dancing and dancing. I am very grateful to them for offering their aspiration. They have found their way in devotional dancing. We have found our way: through our Peace-Blossoms, our Peace Run and World Harmony Run and so many other activities. We do not have to convince any seekers that our way is the best way. We will only say that our way is one way. Their ways are their ways. We cannot convince anybody. If I am satisfied with ice cream, I will eat ice cream. I do not have to worry what others say about ice cream.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for some seekers to accept other ways. Then again, the same people, when they see that the rest of the world has claimed someone, will also claim that individual. Three weeks before Tagore got the Nobel Prize, in one magazine a poem of his was mercilessly criticised. The critic said the poem was simply horrible. Three weeks later, what happened? The same critic, in the same newspaper, said so many nice things about that poem. It was absurd, unimaginable! He extolled Tagore to the skies for that poem. Before Tagore received the Nobel Prize, that critic gave Tagore his ruthless criticism.</p>
<p>Before Swami Vivekananda became well known, nobody paid attention to him. He had a few devotees here and there, and some critics. But once Swami Vivekananda became famous, once the Western world accepted him, his compatriots claimed him immediately.</p>
<p>If we are successful in arriving at our goal in our way, then others will claim us. We will show the seekers our way, but if they do not accept our way, let them find their own way.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, are you offering special performances for the strongman Hugo Girard in response to something unique in his soul, or is there some special inner reason?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, are you offering special performances for the strongman Hugo Girard in response to something unique in his soul, or is there some special inner reason?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am offering my little contributions to the strength indomitable and, at the same time, to the infinite power of the universal soul. There is an adage: <em>Nayam atma bala-hinena labhyo</em> — “The soul cannot be won by the weakling.” People who are by nature weak — physically, vitally, mentally, psychically, spiritually — will not be able to realise God. At the same time, one does not have to be a stronger than the strongest human being — no! The amount of physical strength God has allotted to each individual should come to the fore. Physical fitness is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, many spiritual Masters of the hoary past did not believe and also many spiritual Masters of the present-day world do not believe this infallible truth.</p>
<p>The universe has strength. Spiritually we use the term “power,” but when we use the term "strength,” it is mostly physical and vital strength that we are referring to. Mental power we do not see, but the physical power, the physical strength we do see, if we can lift something heavy.</p>
<p>I am honouring Hugo Girard. He is one of the world’s strongest men. Where can you find such a strong man — the strongest man? It is not an everyday affair to meet with an individual who is physically so strong, unimaginably strong. He deserves my utmost appreciation and admiration. I have lifted over eight thousand people. When I honour them in this way, I take it as my dedicated, devoted service. Otherwise, I could not have lifted more than fifteen or twenty or thirty people. The human mind would have come to the fore and said, “This is not appropriate for a spiritual figure.” The mind tells us all kinds of nonsense!</p>
<p>When we bring spirituality into any field, whether it is physical or vital or mental, the first thing that happens is that our human pride goes away. Many people may misunderstand me. They may think I am very, very proud because I lift such heavy weights. But I wish to say in all sincerity that I have taken my weightlifting as a dedicated service.</p>
<p>Again, my way is not the way. My Supreme’s Way is the only Way. When I was in India, heavyweight champions, people dealing with the body-consciousness, like wrestlers, boxers and weightlifters, I could not appreciate at all. I thought that something was wrong with them. How could they have any subtle feelings, tender feelings? How could they develop their intellect and other aspects of their being? But my way is not the way; God’s Way is the only Way. It was my Inner Pilot who wanted me to enter into weightlifting. Otherwise, if I had been left alone and gone in my own way, I would always have given a wide berth to weightlifting. It would have been impossible for me to enter into this field!</p>
<p>On the outer plane it is true that I am honouring Hugo Girard. I am honouring him the way I have honoured my supreme hero Mahasamrat Bill Pearl and others. It is not an easy task to be one of the strongest men in the world, and he has a very simple heart, a sincere heart and a pure heart. When simplicity, sincerity and purity I see in abundance in somebody’s life, I do have tremendous appreciation, admiration and love for that person. I love him because of his simplicity and sincerity, and also because he is a man of humility. Some champions in the physical field — boxers, wrestlers and others — do not believe in humility. When I see that somebody has contributed so much in the physical world and still maintains humility, I admire and I love that person. Hugo is one of those. Outwardly,</p>
<p>I am honouring him with my utmost love and admiration. Inwardly, I am dealing with the soul, the soul of the universe that supplies us with energy, untiring energy and strength.</p>
<p>So many people with abundant strength do not believe in humility. They proclaim, “It is my strength, my strength, my strength!” Julius Caesar said, <em>Veni vidi vici</em> — “I came, I saw, I conquered.” We say, “I came, I loved and I became." That is our motto. I have become one with the physical and with the spiritual. My life-boat plies between the physical strength and the spiritual power.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, can you please talk about the experience you had before you realised God?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, can you please talk about the experience you had before you realised God?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I realised God definitely not just in my last incarnation, but quite a few incarnations earlier. I was the dearest disciple of someone.</p>
<p>In my earlier incarnations I mixed freely with “monkeys and donkeys.” Those monkeys and donkeys are called occult powers. Some spiritual Masters call those powers monkeys and donkeys, and I also am of the same opinion. I used those powers right and left. But when we develop wisdom, we do not feel like using those powers — that is, outwardly. Inwardly there is not a single day when spiritual Masters do not use their occult powers. Outwardly we may not use them often. On rare occasions we do use them outwardly, and sometimes people may see that something is happening.</p>
<p>You asked me what happened before I realised God. What happens before God-realisation? A little lotus flower blooms and blooms and blooms. All of a sudden it is fully blossomed. It is like day and night. The night is very thick, but little by little the sky is clearing. All of a sudden we can see that the sky is fully clear. But the best thing is to think of a flower that is blooming, blooming, blooming. All of a sudden it blossoms. Similarly, when aspiration becomes very strong, when the inner flame goes high, higher, highest, it knows it is reaching the highest. Somebody is climbing, climbing from the foot of the tree. He climbs up, up, up, up, and then he reaches the topmost branch. With his aspiration he is going up, up, up, up. Once he gets to the top, he is stationed there.</p>
<p>At this point, some people are satisfied. That is the end of their achievement. Again, some people are not satisfied. Their inner hunger is so intense. Someone will touch the foot of the God-realisation-tree. Then he will climb up a few steps. Then he may climb high, higher, highest. Again, the God-realisation-tree itself always grows. People will think that it is absurd; the Highest is the Highest. But I wish to say that my Guru Supreme, who is Infinite, Eternal, Absolute, is transcending Himself. I see Him always expanding, expanding. People will say, “How can this be? He is God. He already has everything!” God has everything, God is everything, true; but in His Creation He has coined the word “progress.”</p>
<p>God is dealing with Infinity. Do we understand what Infinity is? He is dealing with Eternity. What is Eternity? With our mind we know how to spell “Infinity” and “Eternity” very well; we will not make a mistake. Eternity we see with the soul; Infinity we see with the soul. If we use the soul, we see that there is expansion. If we use the soul, if we become the soul, then we are bound to see that God the Infinite is expanding. He is progressing and expanding in every field because that is the seed that He has sown, the progress-seed. When He used His Vision, He said that He would go beyond, beyond. “Beyond” is the Message of the Supreme. There is no fixed goal, no fixed boundary — no! The Supreme’s only Message to us is to go beyond, go beyond, go beyond, go beyond.</p>
<p>In my case, little by little I saw a bloom, and then a blossom. I have been blossoming, blossoming, blossoming since I realised God. But again, I have not reached my final goal.</p>
<p>My Transcendental Photograph has height. Believe it or not, some people have seen God inside my Transcendental Photograph. About fifteen years ago, I was meditating in my house. There were about twenty disciples with me. I was seated on my throne, and there was a Transcendental Photograph hanging on the wall. There was absolutely no wind, no disturbance. At around four-thirty or five o’clock, the Transcendental Photograph fell down. And what did I see? My Transcendental Photograph fell at my feet. How can I tell you this, and how can you believe it? I smile at you, I laugh with you, I enjoy so many activities with you; but I do know that I have gone beyond my Transcendental Consciousness. The Transcendental Photograph is enough, more than enough — not only for my disciples, but for humanity. It is enough for human beings to see my divinity. But the Supreme did not want to stop there, at the height of the Transcendental Photograph.</p>
<p>The Supreme does feel that the Transcendental Photograph is enough; but when it is a matter of my realisation-expansion, the transcendence of my realisation has taken place. In this way I can clearly see that the highest Absolute Supreme is also like us. His Vision is to go on, to go beyond, beyond, beyond. This is His Message to everybody, to the whole world, whether people are my disciples or somebody else’s disciples. <em>The Ever-Transcending Beyond:</em> these are not mere English words. The Ever-Transcending Beyond is the Vision of the Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Might is not light; light is might. Now we are seeing that many people feel might is light. I am showing you how to become good disciples, good seekers. My spiritual power is showing you how to be good. Light says, “I love you, I love you; I have become one with you. I love you to such an extent that I have become one with you.” That is the message of light. That light has to guide us. Might has not to guide us. If might guides us, we will see only destruction everywhere. By beating someone, by screaming at someone, by cursing someone, no individual is going to show the light. That is not the way of light. When light guides us, it is all oneness-embrace.</p>
<p>A nation has to believe in light, not in might. Individuals and Governments have to care for light, light. Might thinks that it is showing the light, or that it is the light, but that is not true. Light is might.</p>
<p>When people give talks on our philosophy, they should only try to offer light. What we need is light, and light has might in it. If we start with might, might does not embody light. But when we embody light, our might is totally different. That might does not break the world; it only embraces the world.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this moment, the world needs peace. We need peace much more than anything else. The entire world needs peace; each human being needs peace. If one gets the Nobel Prize for Literature, only some people will get benefit from it, either in the heart or in the mind. But if the right person receives the Peace Prize, it touches the very depths of everybody’s heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At one time we had a very good Centre in Jamaica, West Indies. I used to call the leader my mother, because she was full of compassion and affection for me. She was a black lady, very stout.</p>
<p>Alas, after some time this lady felt that I was starting to give all importance to young boys and young girls in the Centre, and that I would have no time to pay any attention to elderly people. She did not wait to see what was going to happen. Unfortunately, the disciples believed her, and then they left our Centre.</p>
<p>The very first time I spoke most seriously to about forty disciples in my house, this lady was there. She came up to me and put her hand on my head. She said, “Son, I think you have got a very high fever. That is why you have scolded us.” This was one of my “mothers”!</p>
<p>I was also in a spiritual community. I did not have my physical mother at that time, but I had four or five other “mothers.” The Ashramites were very kind and affectionate to me. My sisters and brothers and I were quite close to the Divine Mother, and inwardly we were very close to Sri Aurobindo. When I did something good or great, my sisters and brothers were infinitely, infinitely happier than I was, believe me. I could not equal their happiness. When I competed in the long jump or high jump, my brother Mantu took care of my worries and anxieties. I was not at all worried or anxious, but he was worried. The moment he heard that I had stood first in running or jumping or some other event, you cannot imagine his joy! In this lifetime there is no match for the happiness that I witnessed in my dear ones, my brothers and sisters, when I did well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When the mind is pure, absolutely pure, we can easily hear the inner voice. At that time we can hear the inner voice clearly, plus correctly. Sometimes when we hear the voice, it is twisted by the impure mind. If the mind has impurity or wrong thoughts, then the voice is twisted. We hear the voice, but we hear it in a different way. But when the mind is pure, absolutely pure, the inner voice we will hear exactly the way we are supposed to hear it.</p>
<p>If we want to hear the inner voice, the mind has to be very clear. It need not be impurity as such — vital or physical impurity — that prevents us from hearing the inner voice. If any wrong thought enters into our mind, the inner voice does not come to us very clearly. This is the problem.</p>
<p>The inner voice is always eager, eager to help us. The inner voice is not something that we have to pray, pray and pray for all the time. It is like the mother, who is always ready to tell the child, “Do the right thing! This is the right thing.” But the child does not pay attention because the child has so many other things to do.</p>
<p>Purity and silence are needed. If we can develop purity and silence in the mind, then we can easily hear the inner voice. The inner voice is always eager to help you and to help us all.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The difference is that my sisters and brothers never expected anything from me in return, period. They expected nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing! They only wanted my joy, in my own way. My disciples give me joy, and at the same time they expect from me. Since they have given me joy, since they have done something good or great, since they have smiled at me, since they have achieved something, since they have received a good performance report from their office, they expect something from me. Always if somebody does something good for me or even for himself, which is the same thing, there is expectation, expectation. The individual expects that I will say something nice, something encouraging, or I will give him something.</p>
<p>In my case, my sisters and brothers never, never cared for expectation. They never expected anything from me. They expected from me only in a silly way: that I would come to eat at a certain time. If I was late, they scolded me so affectionately. These expectations were on the very ordinary level. Once when I was late, my cousin playfully said, “I will kick you!” I said, “All right, kick me! Show me how you will kick me.” My cousin raised her leg to show me how she would kick me, and then she could not lower it, because I used a little bit of occult power. This was her silly expectation: only that I should not come late. Again, the same cousin showed me such affection. In return, she did not expect anything from me.</p>
<p>When my disciples do something good, there is expectation. When there is expectation, there is always a problem. At that time joy goes away. The human problem is always expectation. We say, “I did so much for you. Can you not do something for me?”</p>
<p>The whole philosophy in our spiritual life is “give, give, give.” If so is the Will of God, God will give us back. We pray and pray and pray for something good. Our prayer goes on, goes on, goes on. If it is the Will of God, we will get it; but our expectation ruins our joy. Then again, our desire may not be fulfilled. From the beginning we have to say, “I desire this, my Lord. If it is Your Will, kindly fulfil my desire. But if it is not Your Will, then please forget about it.”</p>
<p>Here is the problem: expectation. The solution is to live in the heart. We can live in the heart no matter how old we are — even if we are seventy, eighty or ninety years old. If we live in the heart, everything is possible, everything is possible. When we give something to a little child, he is so full of affection. Here and there he moves around with such joy. In exactly the same way if we can live in the heart, we can love others and we can fulfil ourselves.</p>

Then you have to feel that I have a “hotline.” I have the closest connection with the Absolute Lord Supreme. Since I have this connection with the Supreme, I will definitely feed your soul.

Is that true? I am worried because I have a cat at home." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some people are very fond of cats, while others are fond of dogs. Still others may be fond of horses and other animals. These gentle animals — not tigers and lions and panthers — can teach us affection and sweetness, and we can also offer them these qualities. You give affection to your little cat, and the cat can give affection to you in its own way.</p>
<p>People are so fond of their dogs, and dogs are so fond of their masters. The master gives the dog just a little food, and the dog is ready to give its life for the master at any moment.</p>
<p>As soon as you see your cat, when your cat is moving around you, your affection comes to the fore. Even if you are stonehearted, even if you are given to quarrelling and fighting and there is no compassion in your life, when your own cat comes near you and moves around you, licking your feet, for the time being you become the most kind-hearted person.</p>
<p>I have never said and I will never say that cats and dogs or other animals that we keep in the house will take away our spiritual progress — no! They only add to our spiritual progress. If we are affectionate to them, if they are affectionate to us, it will not take away our spiritual progress. Again, there are certain immortal stories in the <em>Mahabhatata</em>. These are very rare stories. An old lady was very, very devoted to Lord Krishna. Sri Krishna and Arjuna were observing her. Arjuna said to Sri Krishna, “This old lady is so devoted to you. She struggles so hard to take care of her cow. Can you not give her some means so that she does not have to work so hard?”</p>
<p>Lord Krishna said, “No, I want the cow to die,” and the cow did die. Why? This particular lady was very spiritually advanced, so Sri Krishna wanted her not to be attached to that cow, but only to think of him. This kind of incident is very, very rare. That lady was a super-class devotee of Lord Krishna. Ordinary seekers, budding seekers and seekers who have been on the spiritual path for many years can easily have a cat or dog. But if one is on the verge of God-realisation and attachment comes into the picture, then it is not good. In the beginning of the spiritual life or in the middle stage, it is all right to have a cat or dog. You are fond of someone, let us say, and someone is fond of you. But you have to be sure that this fondness is not attachment. Attachment is totally different. I have never written and I will never write anything against innocent fondness.</p>
<p>In my family, I was for dogs and my sisters were for cats. It is a matter of individual preference. Many years ago when I was living in Manhattan, a devotee’s cat passed by me. Then it sat on my lap. It wanted to have a new life, a human life, and I did grant a human life to that cat.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I give a spiritual name, it can be meant only for this incarnation, or for the future incarnations as well, eternally. When I give a spiritual name, it has to do with the soul’s qualities and capacities. The soul has many, many qualities and capacities, and I give the spiritual name for the fulfilment of the soul’s qualities and capacities.</p>
<p>In this incarnation some disciples are with me, but the unfortunate thing is that in their next incarnation they may not care for the spiritual life. They may care for ordinary life, worldly life: getting married, having children and so on. At that time the soul’s qualities and capacities will not be manifested. Then again, after some ordinary lives, if an individual once more enters into the spiritual life, the soul’s qualities that I have seen will again start manifesting. In this incarnation nobody will be able to manifest all the qualities of the soul — nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody! But if the disciples continue to follow the spiritual life, then they will go on, and they will be able to manifest their soul’s qualities. If they take up ordinary life, then again their progress will stop.</p>
<p>In this incarnation, there is great hope. As much as you can, as much as you can, bring to the fore your soul’s qualities and soul’s capacities. Some people are doing quite well with their soul’s qualities. They are manifesting these capacities through aspiration, dedicated service and oneness with my will.</p>
<p>Very good question!</p>
