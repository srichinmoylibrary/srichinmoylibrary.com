<p>Just as I lifted 313 pounds for the first time, I saw in front of me Sri Aurobindo. I saw Him in the Consciousness He had when He used to meditate on Mother Kali for some time and become inseparably one with Her. Sri Aurobindo was watching me and He was extremely happy and proud.</p>
<p>Here I was at the height of my concentration, and all of a sudden I saw Sri Aurobindo. Such a kaleidoscope goes on!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Bill Pearl’s name</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Bill Pearl’s name" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>About two and a half years ago, before I knew anything about bodybuilding, before I started weightlifting, I heard from people that Bill Pearl had been Mr. Universe five times. As an individual who had become Mr. Universe, Bill Pearl did not mean anything to me because I was not in that world. But, to be very frank, as soon as I heard the name “Bill Pearl,” something like the Liberty Bell started ringing in my heart, not for Bill Pearl, Mr. Universe, but for Bill Pearl, the supremely chosen instrument of God. So, Bill Pearl as a bodybuilder or supreme authority on bodybuilding did not mean anything to me at that time. But Bill Pearl as an individual, a supremely chosen instrument of God, that name started ringing so melodiously in my aspiration-heart and realisation soul. Because I am a conscious, devoted instrument of God, as soon as I hear a name, I get a vibration. In the inner world his name started ringing so powerfully and melodiously in the inmost recesses of my heart. This was my top secret: there was something in the very name Bill Pearl.</p>
<p>When I was in Japan — in Tokyo, Fukuyama, Kyoto and quite a few other places — his very name used to give me tremendous joy. My song on him that I composed in Japan became my mantra. A mantra is an incantation that we repeat countless times to realise God. I have composed thousands of poems and songs, but there is no song that I have repeated as many times as I have repeated the Bill Pearl song. Again, this is not because he is the supreme Himalayan authority on bodybuilding. The inner reason is that I see him as an absolute giant in the inner worlds of aspiration and dedication. God’s Vision-Dream is so powerfully manifested in his life.</p>
<p>So his very name gave me, still gives me and will forever and forever give me the same intensity of ecstasy and delight.</p>

<p>I have been studying many, many pictures of Bill Pearl. In each picture I see clearly a different inner wealth. One is flooded with power, one is flooded with compassion, one is flooded with determination. Each picture of his, each pose, has a very, very special significance for me in the inner world. He reveals his inner strength and power through his outer body-manifestation. And it is no exaggeration, no exaggeration!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Lord Shiva’s encouragement</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Lord Shiva’s encouragement" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today when I lifted 320 pounds — double my body weight — I invited Kailash and a few other boys to my house to watch. Kailash was sitting on the floor in front of me and slightly to the right. In India Mount Kailash is our most sacred mountain, and it is the favourite place of Lord Shiva. He always remains there in His cosmic self-forgetfulness trance.</p>
<p>While I was lifting, I saw with my third eye Lord Shiva sitting in the lotus position, deeply absorbed in meditation. He was sitting about three feet higher than Kailash’s head.</p>
<p>After my second attempt to lift 320, Lord Shiva gave me a little, little smile.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to try the lift for the fourth time, from the very depths of my heart I literally screamed in the inner world: “Shib!” In India, we Bengalis say Shib, not Shiva. Most powerfully I screamed His name, and simultaneously He responded, “Chin!”</p>
<p>Outwardly nothing happened, but at that moment a bolt of energy entered into my arm and I lifted up the weight.</p>
<p>As soon as I did it, Lord Shiva jumped with joy and gave me a broad smile.</p>
<p>Shiva has both power and compassion. On the one hand Shiva is very compassionate. But on the other hand He uses His third eye to destroy ignorance. His power aspect He uses to destroy ignorance and His compassion aspect He uses to lift up humanity.</p>

<p>Today was the first day I attempted to lift 320 pounds and it was also Agraha’s birthday. In the morning I tried to lift the weight four times, but I did not succeed. Then Agraha made such a sincere and fervent request for me to try again that I did try again late in the afternoon. That time I did it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Unmilan’s birthday, so I was honouring both Agraha and Unmilan with my lift. Without Unmilan’s machines, my weightlifting does not exist.</p>

<p>Today before I lifted 320 pounds, double my body weight, I knew immediately that something special was going to happen.

<p>Yesterday, on my calf machine, I lifted a total of 106 tons, and afterwards my legs were hurting like anything.</p>
<p>Later, when I went to the United Nations, I met with a great Bengali novelist in the office of Ambassador Chowdhury of the Bangladesh Mission. The novelist is of my age, but immediately he wanted to touch my feet. At least three times during our meeting, with great difficulty, he went to touch my feet. I felt extremely sorry for him, and I desperately wanted to bend down and lift him up, but because of my leg pain, I could not do it.</p>

<p>I was showing a video of myself lifting 340 pounds. On the tape there was a section where the actual weight was 110 although the sign next to it mentioned 340. The disciples had taken off some of the plates in order to weigh them.</p>
<p>I saw how easily I lifted the 110. Not long ago, I would make such loud sounds while lifting this kind of weight. Now, I am lifting 230 pounds more than this.</p>
<p>Then Agraha said, “Guru, in another year you will be lifting 700 pounds, and 330 pounds for you will be like lifting a feather.”</p>
<p>The Supreme was definitely speaking through Agraha.</p>

<p>Yesterday when I tried to lift 350 pounds for the first time, 350 was responding so nicely. I told some of the disciples that it was a matter of days, not a matter of weeks, before I would be able to lift it. Then I asked them to guess how many days it would take. Some said three, others four or five and one said two. Inwardly I knew that I would lift it today, but nobody guessed one day.</p>
