<h2>Question: How do you learn to concentrate?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> One cannot meditate well unless one knows how to concentrate. At first the seeker should not meditate but only try to concentrate. Then after two weeks, a month, or if necessary two months, he can start meditation.</p>
<p>What do we mean by concentration? We mean inner vigilance, alertness. There are thieves all around us and within us. Who are the thieves? Fear, doubt, worry and anxiety. These inner thieves are the real thieves, not the thieves who steal our money. When we start to concentrate, we have to feel that we will not allow any thieves to enter into our minds. When we are concentrating, we make it hard for hostile forces to enter into us. Otherwise, we become victims to the undivine effects of the wrong forces.</p>
<p>Please try this exercise to develop concentration. In Sanskrit it is called <em>tratak,</em> which means 'gazing'. First wash your eyes properly with cold water, not warm water or hot water. Then make a very small circle on the wall at your own eye-level, and inside it make a dot. It should be black, not blue or red or any other colour. Then stand facing a wall. There should be a distance of about three and a half feet between you and the wall. Focus your attention on the circle with your eyes relaxed and half open. The force of your concentration should come from the middle of your forehead. After three or four minutes, open your eyes fully, and then try to feel that your eyes have covered your whole body. Feel that from head to foot you are all eyes. Your whole physical existence has become nothing but vision. Then please concentrate on the dot inside the circle. Then you have to start making the object of your concentration smaller. After a few seconds try to feel that your whole body has become as tiny as this dot on the wall. Try to feel that the dot is another part of your own existence. Then you will enter into the dot, pierce through it and go to the other side of the dot. From the other side, you have to look back and see your own body. Your physical body is on one side, but on the strength of your concentration you have sent your subtle body through the point of concentration into the object. Your subtle body is now on the other side. Through your subtle body you see your physical body and through your physical body you see your subtle body.</p>
<p>When you began to concentrate, the existence in your physical body became all vision. At that time the dot was your reality. When you entered into the dot, then vision and reality become totally one. You are the vision and you yourself are the reality. When you look back at yourself from the dot, the process becomes reversed. Now you are the vision there, and the place to which you are returning is your reality. At this time, again the vision and the reality become one. When you can see it in this way, your concentration is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>If you can concentrate and go to the other side of the point you were calling reality, your whole existence will be far beyond the vision and the reality. The moment you can feel that you have transcended your vision and your reality, you have boundless power. You will be able to use this power of concentration for your spiritual life, for your intellectual life, while working, while cooking, while doing anything.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The moment I sit down to meditate, all kinds of silly or ugly thoughts come into my mind.

Is there any specific technique you can recommend to help me overcome these thoughts?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to determine whether the thoughts that are attacking you are coming from the outer world or from deep within. In the beginning, it is difficult, I must say, to distinguish the thoughts that are coming from outside from those that are arising from inside you. But gradually you will be able to feel that some thoughts are coming from outside, and these thoughts can be driven back faster than the thoughts that attack you from within. So it is better that each of you right now fight with the outer thoughts first and deal with the inner thoughts later on.</p>
<p>When you see that a thought is about to enter you, please try to muster your soul's will from your heart and bring it right in front of your forehead. The moment your soul's will is seen by the intruding thought, the thought is bound to disappear.</p>
<p>Now I wish to speak about thoughts that you have already accumulated within you. When you see a thought arising from deep within you and when that thought is not divine, but absolutely impure and unlit, then immediately you should try to do one of two things. Try to feel that there is a hole right at the top of your head and then make that thought flow out like a river which goes only in one direction and does not come back. It is then gone and you are freed from it. The other method is to feel that you are a boundless ocean, with its calm, quiet feeling of tranquillity, and that the play of the fish is on the surface. The ocean pays no attention to the ripples of the fish.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: It is difficult for me to concentrate on my heart for longer than just a few minutes. Is there any advice you can give me?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: It is difficult for me to concentrate on my heart for longer than just a few minutes. Is there any advice you can give me?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you concentrate on the heart, the first thing you should try to remember is love. Love means the victory over time. You have all love, all affection, all concern for your husband and son. When they fall sick or need you, you will spend hours and hours with them. You are at their disposal twenty-four hours a day; you are ready to give them everything because of your love. Now, your dear ones are with you for fifty years or sixty years and then they leave you. But you have to know that inside your heart is someone who is infinitely dearer than your husband and children, and that is God. In this world you have some dear ones for a few years, and then you give them everything you can. It seems there is no end to the love you offer them. But the dearest One you will have for all Eternity, and if you want to offer Him your love, naturally it will be all infinite and eternal.</p>
<p>If you concentrate on your heart and soulfully repeat a few times, "Love, love, love," then you will see that love is extending its own horizon. It is identifying itself with time and, again, it is going beyond time, because it needs fulfilment. When love wants fulfilment, it will not stay with time for five or ten minutes. It will extend throughout Eternity. If you know this and meditate on your heart, then the expansion of time comes, the expansion of delight comes, the fulfilment of the soul comes. If you try to feel love, you will extend the capacity of your aspiration, extend the capacity of your realisation and extend the capacity of your oneness with the entire world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When we want to concentrate or meditate on a special thought or problem, how should we do it?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When we want to concentrate or meditate on a special thought or problem, how should we do it?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First let us consider a problem. You have to know the seriousness of the problem. If it is a serious problem, naturally you will have to meditate on it for a long time. If it is not serious, you can solve the problem in a few minutes. If you concentrate on any problem, big or small, think of it as something made of glass. If you drop glass, it will break. It is brittle and fragile, and at any moment it will give way. If you think of a problem in this way, you will find that this is the easiest way to solve it. But if you take it as something very heavy or solid, you will not be able to solve it.</p>
<p>Now let us take a thought. You will say that naturally you concentrate only on good thoughts. But unfortunately, we do unconsciously meditate on bad thoughts. Jealousy, doubt, suspicion — all these we cherish unconsciously. When this kind of bad thought comes, you have to feel that the bad thought represents a person. Just think of jealousy, fear, doubt and hypocrisy as people, and immediately give them a human form: "This fellow has undivine qualities." When it is a good thought, also give it form: "This man has all good qualities — humility, sincerity and so on."</p>
<p>Then what do you do? When you see a good man, feel that he is leading you and try to follow him as long as he wants you to. But if you see a bad man — a man full of fear, anxiety and so forth — feel that he is going to chase you mercilessly and that you have to immediately run away from him. You must never allow him to come near you. When you see someone destructive in front of you, immediately react as though he will destroy you. Feel that your very life is in danger. Very often in the spiritual life, people do not take bad thoughts seriously enough. We cherish these undivine qualities and feel that they are only insects pinching us. But when you have these undivine qualities, you have to feel that they are worse than dragons, something very dangerous.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, how important is it to meditate with our eyes open? Sometimes I can feel your presence more when my eyes are closed.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, how important is it to meditate with our eyes open? Sometimes I can feel your presence more when my eyes are closed." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In ninety out of one hundred cases, disciples who keep their eyes closed fall asleep. For five minutes they meditate, and then for fifteen minutes they remain in the world of sleep. There is no dynamic energy, no will, nothing but lethargy and self-complacency. They only feel a kind of restful, sweet sensation. Then, after some time, by God's miraculous Grace, again they come back and meditate for two or three minutes.</p>
<p>When you keep your eyes closed during meditation and enter into the world of sleep, you may enjoy all kinds of fantasies. Your fertile imagination will make you think that you are entering into the angel world. There are many ways you can make yourself believe that you had a wonderful meditation. In the ashram where I once lived, elderly members who had been there for thirty or forty years would enter into their "highest meditation" and get caught by a nightmare and start screaming. But they were not aware of it. And then, when someone shook them, they would say, "What are you doing? Why are you disturbing me? I was in my highest meditation?" I had a cousin who used to meditate eight or twelve hours a night with her eyes closed and get up the next morning and quarrel and fight with others. This is not meditation; this is a very easy way of self-deception.</p>
<p>If you keep your eyes open, then at that time you can become the judge of your own meditation. If you go very high in your meditation and have a really good vision, you will not feel it is all hallucination if your eyes are open. If you have a really good vision when your eyes are open, you are not going to lose it. And if it is a false vision, you will know it immediately.</p>
<p>If you are having a good meditation with your eyes closed and you feel, say, a cockroach, you will immediately jump up startled or agitated. While you are in a higher world, if your eyes are closed and this creature of Mother Earth disturbs you, at that time there is no connecting link between that particular creature and your own existence. Automatically you become frightened or annoyed. You feel, "Here I am in my highest, and this undivine creature is bothering me." Because you are agitated and disturbed, your meditation disappears. But if you keep your eyes open a little, you know that you belong to this world. You are maintaining your poise and inner power here on earth. You are keeping your mastery over the physical plane.</p>
<p>When you keep your eyes open, you act like a hero in the battlefield of life. It is best to meditate with the eyes partly open and partly closed. This kind of meditation, with the eyes half-open, is called the Lion's meditation. If the eyes are wide open and staring, you will be straining yourself. Half open is always best. In this way, aspiration can flow through the eyes.</p>
<p>You are the root of the tree and, at the same time, the topmost bough. The part of you that has the eyes half open feels it is the root, symbolising Mother Earth. The other part, with the eyes half-closed, is the topmost branch, the world of vision or, you can say, Heaven. A tree without roots is no tree; and again, a tree must also have branches. When you keep your eyes partly opened and partly closed, you can feel yourself a tree in totality, right from the root up to the topmost bough. Your consciousness is up on the highest level and, at the same time, your consciousness is here on earth, trying to transform this world.</p>
<p>When your eyes are half-open, you are focusing your conscious attention not only on the physical plane but also on the subconscious plane. Since your eyes are partly open, you will not fall asleep and end up in one of the lower worlds. You are threatening the world of the subconscious. "Look, I am all alert. You cannot take me into your domain." You are conquering and gaining mastery over the subconscious world of sleep.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other world, the world of alertness where you are keeping your vigilance, is also inviting you with its noise and distractions. If the outer world disturbs you, in the beginning you may want to keep your eyes closed. But when you become more advanced in your spiritual life and have become inwardly stronger, you can overcome these distractions.</p>
<p>Let us take meditation as something very powerful and constant. In the battlefield of life, we have to conquer fear, doubt, anxiety, worry and all our imperfections. When we want to achieve something on the physical plane, we never keep our eyes closed. If we want to win a race here on earth, we can't run with our eyes closed. We will stumble and fall. It is the same in the spiritual life. When we want to run the fastest, when we want to develop inner power, we have to be vigilant, dynamic, alert all the time. We have to run with our eyes open.</p>
<p>The physical mind sometimes has to be convinced of what we are doing. Suppose the Master is bringing down Peace, Light and Bliss. If the disciple is very receptive and can identify his existence with the Master's inner operation, then that person need not keep his eyes open. But even this type of disciple will benefit if he keeps his eyes open and sees what the Master is doing, for then the Master's physical eyes can convince the seeker's mind. The light actually is coming from the Master's spiritual eye, the third eye, but it is offering its wealth to the seeker through the physical eyes. In the movement of the Master's eyes there is light. If one wants to receive the Master's light devotedly, he can do so more effectively if he actually sees the Master's eyes. Otherwise, if the seeker keeps his eyes shut, he may think, "Perhaps the Master is not even meditating on us. He may be here physically, but his consciousness is roaming somewhere else." If, however, the seeker's eyes are open and he sees his Master in deep meditation right in front of him, then he is more convinced of what the Master is doing for him. After meditating for a few minutes with his eyes open, if at that time the disciple has identified himself with the Master totally, then even if he closes his eyes he is bound to see and feel the Master right in front of him.</p>
<p>If you feel that your meditation is more profound when your eyes are closed, if you can stay wide awake and feel my inner presence distinctly without entering into the world of imagination, then I have no objection if you keep your eyes closed. Every rule admits of exception. There are many spiritual Masters who have meditated with their eyes closed, although the very dynamic spiritual Masters used to keep their eyes open. But most of the time — and I know from personal experience and from my oneness with my disciples — if you keep your eyes half open, then it is much better.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you feel it is necessary to assume a particular posture when you meditate, to sit in the lotus position, for example?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you feel it is necessary to assume a particular posture when you meditate, to sit in the lotus position, for example?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the individual. The main thing is to keep the spine erect and straight, and to keep the body relaxed. There are many people who meditate very well while they are seated in a chair. And there are many who sit in the lotus posture only to show off, while their mind is roaming elsewhere. You have to know how much control you have over the mind. If you have control over your mind, you can meditate while running, while talking to people; but if you do not have control over your mind, then it is better to sit in a particular corner of the room and keep your body, especially your back, erect.</p>
<p>Usually when a beginner enters into a spiritual path, he becomes a victim to laziness. Meditation is something new to him and he may not get a satisfactory result all at once, or he may not have the necessary patience. So it is necessary for him to discipline himself as quickly as possible. But for one who has already tasted some inner food — inner Light, Peace or Bliss — it is not necessary to go through this rigorous discipline because meditation has become spontaneous. While he is walking, while he is doing office work, his mind is on God, he is meditating on God. While he is talking to a person, only his mouth is functioning but his mind is somewhere else.</p>
<p>In your case you are the best judge. When you start to meditate, what happens? If your mind roams, then you have to be very careful. If your mind does not roam, if you know that you can hold the reins, then it is not at all obligatory to sit in the lotus posture while you meditate.</p>

But this has never happened to me." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> People say many things, books tell us many things, but the individual experience is of paramount importance. I am not saying that the books are telling you lies or that the people who have had this experience of energy are mistaken. No, they are right in their own assertion, in their own experiences. And what you are experiencing is also right for you.</p>
<p>But unfortunately you are making one mistake. If you feel that just by sitting cross-legged for fifteen minutes or half an hour you are going to develop inner energy or get higher experiences, then you are mistaken. There are many people in the Indian villages who can sit for hours cross-legged. But ask them if they have had any spiritual experiences and, if they are sincere enough, they will say no. There are many who have been practising <em>asanas,</em> physical postures, for many years without ever having had even one solitary experience. Why? It is not just the actual posture. It is not the pose or how you sit. It is the aspiration. If you have the capacity, you can even lie down and meditate. You can run and meditate.</p>
<p>Meditation has to come from deep within, like the cry of a child hungry for food. When the child is hungry, he cries desperately, and the mother comes running, whether she is in the kitchen or in the living room, to feed the child because she feels that the cry comes from the child's heart. If you feel the inner cry for God or if you feel that you need to develop this divine energy within you, then you are bound to develop it. This energy is bound to climb up.</p>
<p>So please do not worry about sitting in the strict lotus posture, <em>padmasana.</em> Just sit straight but relaxed. When you meditate, do not stiffen your body. Sometimes people do <em>padmasana,</em> this cross-legged lotus posture, but they bend forward or make their whole body very stiff. And when the body is stiff, naturally the divine qualities, the fulfilling qualities, which are flowing and streaming, will not be received. So when you sit cross-legged, if your body is rigid, then please immediately forget about your posture. Only try to sit straight but relaxed.</p>
<p>In your case, unfortunately, I can clearly see that your position is correct, but the thing that is actually needed in the lotus posture is missing. When you are sitting cross-legged and are breathing in, the whole body should consciously feel stream of divine Love flowing in and through it. Without Love there is no God, and there is no human existence either. You love yourself, you love God, you love your dearest and nearest ones and you love humanity as a whole. So first please try to bring to the fore God's Love aspect, and once you have established within yourself the Love aspect, then you will see all other aspects are bound to come. Love is the pioneer of all divine qualities. So when you cry for God, feel Love — immediate, spontaneous, unreserved, soulful Love. All the divine qualities of God are bound to follow this divine Love.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to tell you that that kind of meditation is not at all advisable for the beginner, nor even for those who have been meditating for several years. It is only for the most advanced disciples and for realised souls. Others who try to meditate while lying down will immediately enter into the world of sleep or into a kind of inner drift or doze. Furthermore, while you are lying down, your breathing is not as perfect as it is when you are in a sitting position, since it is not conscious or controlled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: In our meditation, can we consciously invoke our soul? And if so, how?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: In our meditation, can we consciously invoke our soul? And if so, how?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In your meditation you can consciously invoke your soul and bring its presence to the fore. In fact, that is one of the fastest ways to realise God. But it all depends on how much benefit you want to get from the soul's presence. I am in front of you right now. You know that a God-realised man is in front of you. You are seeing me, and many other people are seeing me. If somebody has more aspiration than you, then naturally that person will get more benefit, more achievement, more fulfilment from my presence than you will. When you bring the soul to the fore, you make very fast progress if your aspiration is intense.</p>
<p>Now, if you know that when the soul comes forward you make faster progress, how can you bring the soul to the fore? This is the easiest way: when you start meditating, feel that you do not have the body, you do not have the vital, you do not have the mind, you do not have even the heart — you have only the soul. The only thing in your possession, the soul, is the most precious thing on earth.</p>
<p>Next, feel that the thing that you cherish most, treasure most, should become your whole life. Do not feel that you have to possess it; feel that you have to grow into it. When you are in a very deep meditative mood, all of you cherish me, your Guru. Why? Because you feel that your Guru has realised something, has achieved something. This is your first realisation. Your second realisation should be that it is not enough just to feel that I have realised something; you also have to grow into that realisation.</p>
<p>If you cry for the soul to come forward, and feel that you have to grow into the divinity of the soul, the soul will feel that you need it, and see that you want to become it. When your earthly desires have faded away, and only the heavenly aspirations remain in your life, at that time the soul is bound to come to the fore because it feels that you are ready to receive it.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the best attitude to have when meditating with others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the best attitude to have when meditating with others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First you have to know what kind of vibration you are getting while you are meditating with others. Here all of you are good meditators. You have been under my guidance, inwardly and outwardly, for a long time, so here nobody will pull anybody else down. When you are meditating with disciples of your standard, or disciples a little less advanced, you will not feel any resistance, because everyone knows how to meditate in his own way and everyone is meditating.</p>
<p>Try all the time to go up. And when you have gone up to some extent, feel that you are a bird with two wings. Now what will you do? Just come down and lift your brothers and sisters with your wings. Your wings are very powerful, so you come down and take your brothers and sisters up. While you are with nice people, who are also doing good meditation, this is the best attitude to take.</p>
<p>But suppose you meditate with another group. Then you will get a different vibration, a different experience. Suppose you feel that there are people with a lower standard of mediation beside you, people who don't know how to meditate, or who are enjoying vital thoughts, emotional thoughts, impure thoughts. They are sitting beside you trying to fool you, trying to make you believe that they are doing a wonderful meditation, but perhaps they are thinking of their boyfriends or girlfriends, or other emotional things, and you feel that a very ugly vibration is entering into you. At that time what will you do? You will go with your own aspiration to the Highest and then, when you have solid strength, you will try to protect yourself. Do not allow these people to enter into you, and you will not enter into them. If you want to enter into them, you will be caught: whatever you got during your meditation you will lose. And if you allow them to come into you, it is like allowing foreign elements to enter into you; they will enter into you and ruin you.</p>
<p>In the first group, there were no foreign elements; all the disciples there were only an extended part of your consciousness. If you wish to serve them, then with your own meditation go to the Highest and offer them good will through your heart and through your illumined mind. But do not enter into the physical plane to practise it. Do it from your inner good will. That good will itself has power. You go to the Highest and say, "These brothers and sisters are impure, they are not doing well. O Supreme, give them purity. If they have a little purity, they will sincerely aspire." That should be your prayer — to give them some purity so that they can have a better meditation. It has to be done this way.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate with a group, feel that the seekers sitting together are not separate entities but only one entity. Do not think of each individual disciple. Feel that you are the only person meditating and you are entirely responsible for the meditation. Collective meditation is meditation with the feeling of inseparable oneness, absolute oneness. You are the only person meditating and you are the one who is watching yourself; there is nobody else. You are the observer and you are the seeker, not because of your ego, but because of your inseparable oneness.</p>
<p>Otherwise you may look to one side and think, "What have I done today that I cannot meditate as well as she?" Or, "Why do I have to meditate beside him? His consciousness is so low." Or, "Why did I come here? Let me go home and meditate." This way you will think that somebody is meditating better than you or that somebody is dragging you down and it is beneath your dignity to meditate with him. When you start meditating collectively, if you take everyone as your own, then you will have a good meditation. When all have entered into you, when everyone is flowing in you and through you, then you will get the maximum benefit.</p>
