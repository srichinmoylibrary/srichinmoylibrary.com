<h2>Question: Has it ever happened that the soul changes its mind about a particular reincarnation after a baby is born and therefore the baby dies?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> On very rare occasions it has happened that a feminine body with a feminine soul is being born, but in the occult world Mother Kali, let us say, wants a masculine body with a masculine soul. At that time, a spiritual Master has had to use his highest, fastest and strongest occult power. For more than seven hours the Master was fighting and fighting. It is very difficult when the material body is already formed. One has to completely change the heart and remove the soul so another soul can come in.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you are forty years old and for a special reason God wants you to stay on earth for another fifty years. Perhaps your heart, vital and body are extremely good, but your mind is not surrendering to God's Will. You could make the fastest progress, but your mind is standing in your way. In a case like this, God could ask a spiritual Master to replace your mind with a new mind. It is done with good intentions and infinite Grace.</p>
<p>If it happens, it is like an experiment. If it works well, then it is a miracle. But sometimes the old mind does not want to leave, so it comes back. When a Master puts in a new mind, it is like coming up with a new machine that has more capacity and potentiality than the old machine. You expect the new machine to perform well, but sometimes it does not work.</p>
<p>But things like replacing minds happen very, very rarely because they defeat God's Purpose. If God has to put in another mind, then it defeats whatever purpose He had in giving the original mind to the individual.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, they decide in the soul's world that they will come, for example, as father and son or mother and daughter. It is not by chance that a great tennis star is born into the family of another great tennis star. In the soul's world they already had decided that they would play tennis, so one came as the father and the other as the son.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It does not mean that they were twins. It means that in previous incarnations both of them had similar inclinations and similar interests. Twin souls see the truth from a similar perspective.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Some souls come down together and move around together while they are on earth. A group of souls came down together around Sri Ramakrishna and became extremely close to each other. Outwardly they may have felt insecurity or jealousy towards one another and had all kinds of differences, but basically they were fond of each other.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When the soul takes incarnation, are the astrological forces also chosen or is the soul more or less stuck with the astrological conditions that happen to prevail when it descends?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When the soul takes incarnation, are the astrological forces also chosen or is the soul more or less stuck with the astrological conditions that happen to prevail when it descends?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul is not 'stuck'. The soul is descending and the planets are recording what is happening. It is like somebody standing on the street corner observing you while you are going to the bank. On the way to the bank you may pass this individual or that individual, and the person on the street is observing your movements. But you are not seeing him or paying any attention to him because you are focusing only on your destination. When the soul is descending, its destination is earth. We cannot say that the planets are compelling the soul to come down or take a particular body. The planets have nothing to do with it; they are only recording what is happening.</p>
<p>That is why I say a person's astrology can be nullified. It is like a tape. You say something on a tape; but if you want to erase it, then you can record right over what you said with something new. When the soul is descending, it is not inviting people to watch and write a book. From the planets the astrologers are making a chart and predicting what will happen. Sometimes their prediction comes true, but if God's Grace descends, then everything may be nullified.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul comes from a plane infinitely higher than the reach of the planets. It is not that the soul has meetings with the stars and planets to decide how they will work together. No! Before descending to earth, the soul will have an interview with the Supreme, with the Highest, concerning how much it will achieve in its next incarnation. The Supreme tells the soul what He expects it to do in its next incarnation. At this time, the soul is guided either by the Supreme Himself or by one of His messengers. The soul promises that it will do such and such for the Supreme while it is on earth, and the Supreme says, "I hope that you will do it. I have faith in you." So the soul makes a promise to the Supreme, and the Supreme's Hope lies in the soul's promise.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul's name that I give is very often the outer indication of the soul's promise. If I give you a spiritual name, which describes your soul's qualities, that name will help you remember your inner qualities so that you can try consciously to manifest them. Inwardly your soul is all the time telling you what to do. But if outwardly also you are conscious of your soul's qualities and trying to manifest them, then your mind and your soul will go together. The message is coming from the soul and the physical mind is receiving it and trying to fulfil it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the soul wants to keep a connection with the family members from its previous life, it can do so. It may not only keep a connection, but it may actually reincarnate in the same family. At that time, however, it may not have the same relationship with the other family members. Suppose you were somebody's daughter in one incarnation. In future incarnations you may come as that person's mother or sister.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The family is more important than the country, but the country also plays an important role. In my case, it was so easy for me to come to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram because I was born into a spiritual family. Then, when it was God's Intention, I came to America, a young country full of life and promise. America is an excellent place, but it would have been a mistake for me to have taken incarnation in America.</p>
<p>Because I was born in a small village where religion and spiritual life are practised with utmost sincerity and humility, my spiritual background is very solid. The soul-seed was sown in the right place, and then it was nurtured in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, which was also the right place. If I had been born in America, perhaps I might have gone into another line instead of following the spiritual life. So it was absolutely necessary for me to take incarnation in India in a spiritual family.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The last note of the song is played either by the soul or by some being or representative of the Supreme. It is like what happens when a machine is turned off in a factory. There are many workers who know how to turn off the machine. The machine has been running for a long time and then the manager says, "Now one of you turn it off!" He does not point to someone in particular and say, "Do it immediately!" He only says, "Now we shall stop!" Sometimes a few days or even a few months will go by before it happens.</p>
<p>In some cases the manager will say, "Do it immediately!" In that case, death may come abruptly. But in other cases, he says, "One of you turn off the life-machine." The workers are taking their own time, and the manager is not very strict. Then, after some time one or two of the workers will say, "The manager said to turn off the machine. Let us do it; otherwise, he will be mad." Then one of them goes and turns off the machine.</p>
