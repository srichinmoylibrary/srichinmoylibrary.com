<p><em>(Yagnyavalkya and Katyayani.)</em></p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Katyayani, I am now an old man.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: My Lord, there comes a time when every human being becomes old. You are no exception.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Yes, you are right, Katyayani. Katyayani, I wish to make a simple suggestion to you. May I?</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Certainly, by all means.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: As you know, I have now reached a ripe old age. According to tradition, at this stage of life one must enter into the forest and offer one’s life to God in prayer and meditation. It is high time for me to do that.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Who stands in your way, my Lord? Certainly I am not the one who will ever prevent you from doing the right thing.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA Thank you, thank you, my dear Katyayani. Now here is the problem.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: What is it? Tell me, my Lord.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Before I leave, I wish to offer you half my wealth, property and possessions, and the other half I wish to give to my other wife, Maitreyi.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: That is fine with me, although it is I who take care of you most of the time. Maitreyi only wastes her time in fruitless meditation.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Katyayani, my dear, Maitreyi’s meditation is not fruitless. Nor does she waste time when she meditates.</p>
<p>KATYAYANI: It is simply useless to tell you anything about Maitreyi. What I have said is not at all against her. I have just brought to your attention a mere fact, an undeniable fact. Anyway, since she too can claim you as her own, you may as well divide all your possessions between your darling Maitreyi and your maidservant Katyayani. I hate Maitreyi, I literally hate her! I do everything for you, and she takes all the credit. I have never seen such an irresponsible, careless and callous woman. Yet you love her dearly, more dearly than your very life. I tell you once and for all that I hate Maitreyi with all the hatred of the world at my command!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Maitreyi)</em></p>
<p>KATYAYANI: Just think of the devil and the devil appears! Maitreyi, you have appeared unexpectedly, and I disappear deliberately!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Katyayani)</em></p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, I wish to meditate for a few minutes. Will you kindly join me?</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Certainly I will.</p>
<p><em>(Yagnyavalkya and Maitreyi meditate together. Meditation over, Yagnyavalkya blesses Maitreyi.)</em></p>
<p>MAITREYI <em>(thrilled and overjoyed)</em>: My Lord, O matchless sage, I have seen, I have seen!</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: What have you seen, Maitreyi?</p>
<p>MAITREYI: I have seen your third eye wide open. Fathomless is its beauty. Measureless is its power.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: I am proud of you. I am proud of your aspiration. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Maitreyi, I have something quite important to discuss with you. Do you have the time?</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Of course, my Lord, for you I have always the time. I am always at your disposal. This life of mine is ever at your express command.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: I knew it. I knew it. Now Maitreyi, I have already discussed the matter with Katyayani. She has fully agreed.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Please let me know what it is all about.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Ah, of course, forgive me. The time has at last come for me to enter into the forest and spend my remaining days meditating on the Absolute, offering my existence, inner and outer, to my inner Pilot.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, indeed, that’s a splendid idea.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: But listen, my divine wife. I want you to have one full half of my wealth, property and possessions, and the other half, needless to say, goes to Katyayani.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: My Lord, do listen to me first, before I accept or reject your kind offer. You have always taught me that material wealth is of no avail. It is nothing in comparison to the inner wealth. Why, then, do you bind me with material wealth? Tell me one thing, my Lord: will this material wealth in any way add to my heart’s mounting cry?</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p>MAITREYI: Then why do you impose on me things that will take me away from the path of Truth, from the path of Divinity, from the path of Immortality? My Lord, my heart pines only for the immortal, transcendental Self. I want nothing but Immortality’s Life. <em>Yenaham namrta yam kim aham tena kuryam.</em> What shall I do with the things that cannot make me immortal? Let Katyayani have all your material wealth. Let her cherish your earthly possessions, and I shall treasure your heavenly possession — your loftiest realisation, your total oneness with the Absolute.</p>
<p>YAGNYAVALKYA <em>(while blessing Maitreyi)</em>: Maitreyi, you are my heart’s pride. You are my soul’s pride. You are the pride of the absolute Supreme. Your footprints on the sands of time are indelible. Maitreyi, here is my last request: please sing a few soul-stirring songs for me.</p>
<p><em>(Maitreyi sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Yenaham namrta syam</em><br /><em>Kim aham tena kuryam</em></p>
<p><em>[What shall I do with the things that cannot make me immortal?]</em></p>
<p><em>Hiranmayena patrena</em><br /><em>Satyasyapihitam mukham</em><br /><em>Tat tvam pusan apavrnu</em><br /><em>Satya-dharmaya drstaye</em></p>
<p>[The Face of Truth is covered<br /> with a brilliant golden orb.<br /> Remove it, O Sun, so that I who<br /> am devoted to the Truth<br /> may behold the Truth.]</p>
<p><em>Vedaham etam purusam mahantam</em><br /><em>Aditya-varnam tamasah parastat.</em></p>
<p>[I have known this Great Being,<br /> effulgent as the sun,<br /> beyond the boundaries of tenebrous gloom.]</p>
<p><em>Anandadd hy eva khalv imani bhutani jayante</em><br /><em>Anandena jatani jivanti</em><br /><em>Anandam prayantyabhisam visanti</em></p>
<p>[From Delight we came into existence.<br /> In Delight we grow.<br /> At the end of our journey’s close,<br /> into Delight we shall retire.]</p>

<p>YAGNYAVALKYA: Maitreyi, dearer than my life, to you I offer my heart’s eternal gratitude. This heart of mine shall remain sempiternally with your supremely illumined heart in the direct Vision, pure Revelation and total Manifestation of the Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p><em>(King Ashwapati and his daughter Savitri.)</em></p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, you are so beautiful.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, you are so spiritual.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, I love you more than I love my own life.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, I love you, too, more than I love my own life.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, you are my All. In you is my realisation of the Truth. In you is the Perfection of my inner life. Do you know, my daughter, why I have named you Savitri?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: No, Father, I do not know.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: For many years your mother and I had no child. So I prayed and prayed to the goddess Savitri to grant us a divine child. After a long time the goddess was pleased with me, and gave me the gift I longed for. And that gift is your life, your dedicated life. So it is from the goddess Savitri, my Supreme Mother. that you get your name.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, I am so happy, so proud to hear that. From now on I shall try to identify myself with that Supreme Goddess Savitri. and I shall try to please you in every way.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Savitri, all along you have been pleasing me. You already please me in every way. I am so proud of you. Savitri, now the time has come for you to have a partner. You need a divine consort. I have tried very hard to get a suitable husband for you, but I have not succeeded. It pains me severely, but I don’t see anybody on earth who is really worthy of you.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, forgive me, but you are mistaken.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: I will be happy if you can prove that I am mistaken. I really want to be proven wrong, for when I see that you have someone whom you love and who is really worthy of you, I will be the happiest person on earth. Please tell me, my daughter, what is the name of your future husband?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, it is Satyavan.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Who is he?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, he is the son of King Dyumatsen. I am sure you have heard of Dyumatsen. He is the King of Shalva.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Yes, my child, yes. Of course I know of Dyumatsen. But don’t you know that he has been driven out of his Kingdom by his enemies? He is now roaming in the forest like a beggar.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Yes, Father, I know, I know. It was in the forest that I met his son, Satyavan. He has conquered my heart, Father.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, my Savitri, to please you is to fulfil my soul. But I know that on the physical plane you will suffer much if you marry the son of a beggar. You are embracing poverty, but I am ready to offer all my wealth to make you happy and to make Satyavan’s parents prosperous again. In your happiness is the fulfillment of my life and the manifestation of my soul.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, Father, Father, I am yours. My life is yours. My life-breath is a garland of gratitude which I place at your feet.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Narada.)</em></p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: O sage Narada, do you know anything about Satyavan, the son of King Dyumatsen, who is now dethroned and roaming in the forest?</p>
<p>NARADA: Yes, I know, I know. Dyumatsen has now become blind. And his son — I have seen him quite a few times. He is very intelligent, very beautiful, very spiritual and divine. In every way he is a great, most promising young man.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: I am so happy, so happy to hear you say this, because my daughter wants to marry him.</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri? Savitri wishes to marry Satyavan?</p>
<p><em>(Savitri looks down, embarrassed.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: O sage, please tell me, what is wrong with that? What is disturbing you?</p>
<p>NARADA: Nothing is wrong with me, but everything is wrong with you, O Savitri.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Please, please tell me what is wrong with me?</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri, you have no vision of the future. But I do have that vision, and I tell you that Satyavan is going to die soon. Savitri, he will live on earth only for one fleeting year.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: Only one year, one year? And then I have to see my daughter a widow? Impossible, impossible!</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, just a few minutes ago you told me that to please me is to fulfil your soul. Now you are changing your mind. Father, real love does not care for earthly years. I love him, and that is all. I do not need anything more from my life. If my Satyavan is destined to live only for one year, I am fully prepared to accept him as my husband for that short time. If he dies, what can I do? To see him, to be with him for as long as I can, is the only thing I need in my life.</p>
<p>ASHWAPATI: My daughter, I am all for you. You want him; that is more than enough. I am going to speak to his father, Dyumatsen, and then we shall make arrangements for your wedding.</p>
<p>NARADA: Savitri, on the day you get married, start counting the days. When one year is completed, you will lose your husband. But my blessing will be with you, Savitri, because you are most devoted to him.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Bless me, O sage. Satyavan, Satyavan! He is my heart’s light; he is my soul’s sun.</p>

<p><em>(Dyumatsen, Satyavan and Savitri in the forest.)</em></p>
<p>DYUMATSEN: Savitri, my daughter, you have now been one of us for some time. My son is so fond of you, and I am so fond of you. We are all fond of one another. But my heart breaks when I see you working so hard, and when I see my son going every day to cut down trees for fuel. This life of hardship is unbearable. I was a King. I was thrown out by my enemies. Now I am in the forest, helpless. I have lost my sight, but you and my son, Satyavan — both of you are my inner eyes. My outer eyes God has taken away, but He has given me two inner eyes. One is my son; one is my Savitri. Through your eyes I see the world, and through your hearts I feel the world, O Savitri, O Satyavan.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Father, we shall make you happy. Satyavan and I will make your life happy. You may not get your Kingdom back, but you have us. We shall give you constant joy, constant satisfaction. We assure you, Father, at every moment we shall try to please you in your own way, according to our capacity.</p>
<p>DYUMATSEN: I know, I know. You and Satyavan will do everything for me. I live on earth only to feel happiness in your two dedicated lives. You are spiritual, my son is spiritual and I am spiritual. Our life of spirituality is our only consolation. Our life of spirituality is our only illumination. Our life of spirituality is God’s real Pride. <em>(Pauses.)</em> You know, Savitri, Satyavan, I am happy I am happy because my life I have dedicated to the Will of the Supreme, to the Will of God. I have no will of my own. He is now my All. He gives me inner joy, inner satisfaction. My Kingdom I have lost, but I have found God inside my heart. The kingdom of falsehood has deserted me, but the Kingdom of Truth has dawned in my devoted heart.</p>

<p><em>(Savitri is alone.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(thinking aloud)</em>: Today is the last day of my husband’s life. Throughout the year I have prayed to the god Surya to protect my Satyavan, but this is the fatal day. I have kept it a deep secret. Nobody knows, neither my husband nor my father-in-law.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Satyavan.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(to Satyavan)</em>: Lord, today I would like to come with you. I would like to follow you into the thick forest where you cut down trees for fuel.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, why do you want to go into the thick forest? Why? Why?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: My Lord, since our marriage I have never made a request to you for anything. This will be my first and last request. If you fulfil my request, I will be most grateful to you. I will never ask you for another boon as long as I am on earth.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, is there anything on earth that I would not do for you? My body, my vital, my mind, my heart, my soul are all for you, for you, my Savitri. Come with me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Scene IV</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Scene IV" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>(Savitri and Satyavan are in the thick of the forest. Satyavan has just plucked a few fruits, unripe, which they both are eating.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: Do you come here every day? This place is not safe. I hear the sounds of ferocious animals. How do you come home safely?</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, you have more faith in God than I have. It is God who protects me. It is God who has given me the strength to cut down the trees and make fuel. We are poor, Savitri, you know, but there was a time when we were rich and my father used to rule the Kingdom of Shalva. Now the days of outer prosperity are gone, but the days of inner prosperity have started. This last year, since you have come into my life, has been all Joy, all Love, all Delight, all Divinity. Savitri, you have transformed our inner kingdom. Before we met you, our inner kingdom was the kingdom of worries, but now it is the Kingdom of Light and Delight. Our outer kingdom was the kingdom of frustration; now it is the Kingdom of Joy and Fulfilment. <em>(Pauses.)</em> Savitri, I have finished eating. Now you observe, while I go and cut down trees.</p>
<p><em>(Savitri meditates with folded hands, silently looking at Surya, the sun god.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI <em>(in a low voice)</em>: O God, Lord Surya, O Sun, today is the last day of my husband’s life. Protect him, protect him. Narada told me that today would be my husband’s last day. I know the prophecy of the sage Narada can never prove false. But, O Lord Surya, you can save me, you can save my husband. I pray to you.</p>
<p><em>(She begins chanting Surya’s name.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Satyavan comes over to where she is sitting.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Savitri, I feel extremely tired. I don’t know why, but I am unable to move. My hands have no strength at all. My feet have lost all strength; I can’t stand up.</p>
<p><em>(Satyavan falls to the ground. Savitri takes her husband’s head on her lap. Enter the King of Death, Yamaraj, tall and stout.)</em></p>
<p>SAVITRI: Who are you?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: I am Yamaraj, the King of Death.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: What brings you here?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Your husband’s life has ended.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I was told that it is your messengers who come to take people away. How is it that you have come yourself, O King of Death?</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Your husband led a most devoted, spiritual and divine life. That is why I personally have come instead of sending my messengers. Savitri, now your husband is my possession. I am taking him with me.</p>
<p><em>(Satyavan rises and follows Yamaraj, like a sleepwalker. Savitri follows Yamaraj and Satyavan.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: What are you doing? Where are you going?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I am Satyavan’s wife. Wherever my husband goes, I have to go.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Go home. You will not be able to come with us. I will not take you: your time has not come. We will walk very fast. We will disappear.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O King of Death, be compassionate. I have been all devotion to my husband. I want to be with him. Now, can you not take me also? To live without my husband is impossible for me. Take me with you, please. Do me this favour. I am at your feet.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, don’t be so silly. I cannot do that. But if you go home, I will give Satyavan’s father back his eyesight. I will grant you that boon, if you will go home now.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Thank you. I am so grateful that you will give my father-in-law back his eyesight. But I cannot leave my husband. I want to go with him.</p>
<p><em>(Savitri has been following Yamaraj for a long time. She is becoming exhausted, but she will not stop.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, I am ready to give you any boon you want, but I tell you, I can’t take you with me, nor can I give back your husband’s life.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, either take me with you wherever you carry my husband, or give his life back to me. I will not leave him.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, your love for your husband is unique. I shall give you another boon. I shall bless you with one hundred sons. These sons will make you happy.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, what kind of boon are you offering me? How will I have one hundred sons without a husband? How is it possible? I have been all faithfulness, all devotion to my husband. You know, during this one year of our marriage, what kind of life I have led.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, forgive me. Forgive me.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: O Yamaraj, I do not want to have one hundred sons. Even if you give my husband’s life back, I do not want a hundred sons. I want only my husband. My husband is all I need. Either give his life back to me so that we can go home where his old blind father is waiting for us, or allow me to go with you wherever you carry him. I shall follow your footsteps. I am tired, I am exhausted, but I am prepared to die while following my beloved husband.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Savitri, your faithfulness, your devotion, your love have pleased me. Yours is the life of love, yours is the life of devotion. Your life has taught humanity what love is, inseparable love, divine love. Your life has taught and will teach humanity what devoted oneness is. Savitri, I give you your husband.</p>
<p><em>(Yamaraj touches the forehead of Satyavan and disappears.)</em></p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Where am I, Savitri? I don’t recognise this place. Where have you brought me? Where am I?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Is this place new to you?</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: Totally new. I have never seen this place. How did you bring me here?</p>
<p>SAVITRI: Well, I shall tell you tomorrow how I brought you here.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: I was fast asleep, Savitri. Why didn’t you wake me up? True, I was exhausted, but I would have gotten up. I would not have been offended. Now what will Father think of us? He will think that both of us today have been very immature. Poor Father, I am sure he is thinking of us, he is missing us. Every day in the evening I come back home. Now it is already night. Father will think that, just because today we have been together in the forest, we have forgotten all about him.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I shall speak to your father. I shall ask him for his forgiveness and he will surely grant it.</p>
<p>SATYAVAN: But tell me, tell me, how have I come here? How is it that we are here? This place is so unfamiliar.</p>
<p>SAVITRI: I will tell you all about it, O Satyavan, O Lord of my life. Let us go home, let us go home. I have a sweet story to tell you. This story will give you immense joy. Let us go home. Father is waiting. He needs us desperately. Let us go home.</p>

<p><em>(The home of two devotees, husband and wife.)</em></p>
<p>WIFE: Kali, Kali, all the time Kali! What has Kali ever done for us? She has only created untold problems.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Krishna, Krishna, all the time, all the time! What has Krishna done for us? He has only deceived the world, and he is deceiving you.</p>
<p>WIFE: Krishna has deceived the world? My Krishna has deceived the world? My Krishna is all love, all love for mankind. Your Kali is ruthless. She kills people, she destroys people. She is called destruction. I have lost my only daughter because of her. When she was seriously ill you prayed to Kali. You assured me that Kali would cure our daughter. Now we have lost our only daughter. <em>(Cries.)</em></p>
<p>HUSBAND: Why didn’t you pray to your Krishna? If he is so kind, so generous, so compassionate, why didn’t you call on him? Why didn’t you pray to him to cure our daughter?</p>
<p>WIFE: I didn’t invoke Krishna because I did not want to conflict with your prayer. I thought that since you were praying most ardently to your Kali, your Kali would cure our dearest, sweetest daughter. We have lost our daughter because of Kali. Now if our son gets even a headache I will not allow you to pray to Kali. I will pray to Krishna, my Krishna. He will cure our son. There is no danger on earth which I cannot conquer with my prayers to Krishna. Our son will remain on earth, happy and prosperous, all by Krishna’s Grace. Our son will become great, very great. And I know it is Krishna’s Grace that will make him great.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: I also want our son to be happy and great. If you feel that your Lord Krishna will make our son happy and great, then you pray to Krishna and I shall remain silent. I shall silently pray to my Kali to give me joy, to give me peace of mind, so that I can bear your constant scoldings and insults.</p>
<p>WIFE: If I scold you, then you have to know that you deserve it. You are callous, useless, hopeless in every way.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Let us not quarrel. Let us not fight in front of our son. I wish you to be happy; I wish my son to be happy; I wish my Kali to make me happy.</p>
<p>SON: How I wish I could do something so that all our problems would be solved! Father is fond of Kali; Mother is fond of Krishna. I do not know of whom I am fond. No, I <em>do</em> know of whom I am fond. But if I say I am fond of Krishna, Father will be displeased; and if I say I am fond of Kali, Mother will be displeased. So I won’t say.</p>
<p>WIFE: All right, keep it secret.</p>
<p>HUSBAND: Even if you say you are fond of Krishna, I will not be displeased. You are free to choose.</p>
<p>WIFE: I also want to tell you, my son, that if you are fond of Kali, you must not think I will be displeased with you. You have a free choice. But it is better for you to be fond of one particular deity, to have total faith in him and love and adoration for him, You should worship only one deity, and that deity will make you really happy, great and prosperous.</p>

<p><em>(Night. The son is sleeping. He suddenly awakens.)</em></p>
<p>SON: What a strange dream I had! I dreamt that I struck the statue of Kali which is in my father’s room and broke it to pieces. I was so happy to inform my mother that now there is only one statue in the house. All along I have been inwardly, secretly praying to Krishna. I am fond of Krishna and not of Kali. Let me go and see if the statue is broken or not. <em>(Opens the door to his father’s room and sees a statue of Krishna, not of Kali. He is wonder-struck.)</em> How can it be? How can it be? <em>(Goes to his mother’s room and looks in. Her own statue of Krishna is still there.)</em> Now we have two statues of Krishna! But perhaps I was mistaken. Let me go again to Father’s room and see. Maybe Father has replaced Kali’s statue. Perhaps he has given away Kali’s statue and bought a statue of Krishna so that Mother will be happy. Perhaps he does not want to quarrel with Mother anymore. <em>(He goes to his Father’s room and sees that the statue of Krishna is still there. He wakes his father.)</em></p>
<p>FATHER: What are you doing here at this hour?</p>
<p>SON: Why have you replaced Kali? Why do I see Krishna’s statue?</p>
<p>FATHER: Krishna? Krishna? How did Krishna get here? Has your mother brought her statue here and put it in my room?</p>
<p>SON: No, the same Krishna statue is in her room. I was just there.</p>
<p>FATHER: Let me go into your mother’s room and see.</p>
<p><em>(Father and son go into the mother’s room and see the same statue of Krishna there.)</em></p>
<p>MOTHER: What is the matter? What are you doing here at this hour? What are you doing in my room?</p>
<p>SON: Mother, Mother, now there is only Krishna in our family! In your room is Krishna and in Father’s room is Krishna.</p>
<p>MOTHER: What? Is it true? I can’t believe my ears! That means your father has now become Krishna’s devotee. I am so glad. I am so glad that at last you have replaced Kali with Krishna.</p>
<p>FATHER: I have not done it. I don’t know how Krishna’s statue got into my room.</p>
<p>MOTHER: Then how could this happen?</p>
<p>SON: Father, this must be a miracle. Since it is a divine miracle, let us meditate together. Let the three of us meditate together and see what we can learn from within.</p>
<p><em>(They sit down to meditate. An angel appears.)</em></p>
<p>ANGEL: It was your son’s prayer that we heard. Your son has always been suffering from your quarrels. One of you cries for Krishna, the other is all for Kali. Although he was fond of Krishna, your son felt miserable because each of you was always fighting for his own chosen deity. In order to prove to you that Kali and Krishna are one, Kali has taken the form of Krishna. From now on there will be no quarrel between you, no dispute between husband and wife, for you know that Kali and Krishna are one. Now Krishna is in both rooms because both wife and son like Krishna. Let there be no more disputes about which deity is better. You two may worship Krishna directly, and you <em>(addressing the husband)</em> may worship Kali inside Krishna. She is most certainly there. They are one.</p>
<p><em>(The angel disappears and the whole room is flooded with light.)</em></p>
