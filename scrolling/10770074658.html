<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Let us give dream a higher and more fulfilling name; let us call it ‘vision’. The relationship between vision and reality is extremely sweet, significant and invaluable. What we call vision tomorrow that very thing is reality. But we get this experience only when we are in the physical plane, the vital plane, the mental plane or the psychic plane. When we are on a very, very high plane, the plane of the soul, or in a plane which is higher than the soul’s plane — such as the plane of the cosmic gods and goddesses — there vision and reality are inseparable. On other planes, vision and reality are two different things which eventually become one, but on the soul’s plane or higher they are <em>already</em> one. On other planes they are playing a hide-and-seek game. But in the higher regions, you can see that they are inseparable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It helps you if you write down your dreams, but you should not analyse them. Only a spiritual Master can analyse your dreams. If you have inspiring dreams you can write them down, either on a piece of paper or on the tablet of your heart. Then when you are sad, depressed and doomed to disappointment, if you read your inspiring dreams, it immediately elevates your consciousness to the highest height. But if you analyse, you use your stupid mind and then all the significance, the subtle essence of the dream will vanish immediately. All its importance, meaning, glory and capacity — everything that is divine and essential in the dream — will be taken away. Don’t use the mind. Do not analyse and scrutinise; only keep the dream inside your heart. Cherish it and treasure it. Then, as soon as you become a victim to undivine forces, place the dream in front of you. Then look in the mirror and see how divine you have become.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does the soul gain any experiences to help its evolution from negative dreams, as it does from real experiences in life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does the soul gain any experiences to help its evolution from negative dreams, as it does from real experiences in life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> ‘Negative dream’ is a very complicated expression. A positive dream we know is something that is inspiring, something that is aspiring in and through us. But negative dreams can be of various types. If, because of a lack of aspiration, somebody dreams about the lower vital life, sexual life, these dreams do not help the soul at all. But if one dreams that he is trying to do something, such as study, but he is failing in his outer examination, or if he wants to be pure and devoted but he is not getting his wish, these kinds of negative dreams can be beneficial. These negative experiences, these temporary pangs, will not stand in one’s way as they might if they were experiences in the outer life. One suffers for five minutes, but when he wakes he is determined to do the thing and to be successful. New determination and new aspiration enter into him and he becomes stronger and more powerful.</p>
<p>We have to take these kinds of dreams as experiences which are helpful at times to make us strong. The son of a boxer is fighting with his father. The father is teaching him how to box, and all the time, the father is striking him and knocking him down. Or a wrestler is teaching his son how to wrestle and the son is being pushed and shoved. These experiences of the buffets of life do help the soul, because they make everything that composes one’s existence — the physical, vital, mental and psychic — strong in the battlefield of life. These experiences add to the soul’s reality and the soul’s light because the stronger the soul becomes, the more opportunity it gets to work through the person for the manifestation of its own light.</p>
<p>Negative dreams of this kind definitely help the soul, just as dreams of progress and success help the soul. If the dream is just about success in the vital world, the soul does not gain anything. But if success is achieved by virtue of one’s divine qualities, one’s sincerity and devotion, then the soul gains. And if the dream is of progress, of progress in the spiritual life, that progress will definitely offer substantial help to the soul.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, if you tell us something in a dream, how do we know if it is true?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, if you tell us something in a dream, how do we know if it is true?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will know whether it is true or not just by your meditation. If I tell you to do something in a dream, first of all you have to know whether it is actually I who have said it. Sometimes it happens that mentally you create a figure of me. No hostile force can take my form, but imagination is very strong in my disciples. You create from your own wishful thinking a being with my face, my body. Like a painter, you create me and you make yourself feel that it is I who have said certain things. If you create that kind of Guru with your wishful thinking, it is not really I who am giving you instruction.</p>
<p>But if you have meditated and prayed during the day, and at night I just appeared to you without your expecting me and gave you a message, and if your heart is thrilled, then you will know that it is I. If you are ready to jump out of bed with the capacity and inspiration of a lion, then you will know that I have given the message to you. Even if I scold you in a dream, you will be thrilled, although if I scold you in the outer plane, you may feel sorry or depressed. But the thrill has to be in the heart, not in the mind or the vital. If you can see me in a beautiful or luminous form, it is genuine. But if mentally you create me, like a sculptor or painter, at that time you will doubt the experience. Your own soul will enter into the false dream and warn you about that other person. But when you have a pure dream of the highest order, you do not have the capacity to doubt it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If they are bad dreams, do not try to remember them at all. On the contrary, forget about them immediately! The sooner you forget, the better it is for you in every plane of consciousness. But if it is a good dream, remember it, but do not give undue value to the dream. That is to say, don’t think of the dream all the time and forget about your reality-life, which demands your conscious and constant attention. But if you remember the dream inside your heart, it will give you joy, inspiration and aspiration so that in your reality-life you can be more devoted, spiritual, divine and perfect.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While you are having a bad dream, if you really want to transform your bad dream into a good dream, then you must immediately try to wake up. Stand up and stretch your limbs; then sit down and meditate. If you dive deep within, then the strength of your inner meditation and light is bound to transform your bad dreams into good, illumining and fulfilling dreams. This is what you have to do if you want to transform them. But if you want to get rid of the bad dreams, then get up immediately right after you have had the dream and say, “Ah, I am now relieved from the evil attack. ” Before you go back to sleep, smile and laugh and dance that the attack is over.</p>

Length is Infinity’s Smile. And man’s dream is an ever-binding hunger which is supported by obscurity’s hunger, impurity’s hunger and insecurity’s hunger.</p>

This you will do in order to unlock the doors to these centres. While locking the navel centre and the lower centres, try to feel the dynamic and volcanic energy of the hero-warrior. While unlocking the heart centre and the higher centres, try to feel the cheerfulness and delight of a child.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can derive much benefit from writing down your dreams in the morning provided that they are good dreams, illumining dreams, encouraging dreams, fulfilling dreams. Each dream is like a flower on a tree. Each flower adds to the beauty of the tree. When you have a dream, you have to feel that your life-tree has borne a flower, a flower of joy, a flower of gratitude, a flower of beauty or a flower of peace, which can be placed at the Feet of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An ocean signifies vastness, immensity. Water signifies consciousness. When we dream of water in the ocean, it means consciousness in its immensity, in its vastness. In the ocean, consciousness is static, whereas in a river, consciousness is dynamic. A river is movement, movement toward the destination. When we dream of a river, we have to feel that consciousness is flowing toward its destination, the sea or the ocean.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why do people walk or talk in their sleep?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why do people walk or talk in their sleep?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You will be surprised to know why people walk in their sleep. When the restless, agitated, uncompromising mind asks the body and the vital to move forward into uncharted land and they do not listen, at that time the mind uses its mental power to create a false body and a false vital. The mind then enters into the false body and false vital and compels them to do what it wants them to do — that is, to move about aimlessly. Again, sometimes one of the inner beings, a divine being, inspires a man to walk, so that it can bring the message of Eternity’s journey to the physical body, vital and mind. This, however, is a rare experience.</p>
<p>For various reasons people talk in their sleep, but there are a few main reasons. One reason is that they are defending themselves in the battlefield of life. Another reason is that they have become victims in the battlefield of life. A third reason is that when they consciously or unconsciously become instruments either of brooding ignorance or of illumining light, their ignorance master or their knowledge-light master train them so that they, too, can recruit more soldiers for their side.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A dream that is like a vision is a living reality. Not only that, but this vision or reality is an indication of great progress in our life’s journey to the ever-transcending Beyond or of our heart-life’s mastery over life’s ignorance-sea.</p>
