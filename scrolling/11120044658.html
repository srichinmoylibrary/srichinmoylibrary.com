<p>Yesterday morning at about 5:30 I was running on 150th Street near Sandhani and Snigdha's house. Suddenly Navina's soul came to me for blessings. I said, "Fine. Why did you not come to New York after the April celebrations?" I decided to ask Kailash why Navina had not come.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I was walking to circus practice. On Snigdha and Sandhani's steps I saw three persons standing: Snigdha, Durga and a third person. So I smiled at them. Snigdha was pointing out the third girl to me, but I couldn't recognise her. I am blind! Then I saw it was Navina. Navina was with them, but her hairstyle had transformed her face.</p>

<p>Early in the morning I walk at a 20-minute pace — very solid. One morning, when I had covered a mile, all of a sudden I saw a lady pass by me. She had a bag on her shoulder. My ego came forward. How could she go faster than me, carrying a bag on her shoulder? O God, I tried to defeat her.</p>
<p>That was the morning I had taken an oath that I wouldn't go very fast. After five minutes, I saw another lady. This one was running for the bus, and she also was passing me. I said, "This is too much!"</p>
<p>Then I walked very fast. I was on the street and she was on the sidewalk. I managed to pass her, but it made me very tired. Was it worth it? In three or four seconds, again she was going ahead of me. I asked myself, "Why did I compete with her?" Then I decided not to compete with her anymore.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Tricking the mind</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Tricking the mind" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>When I run mile after mile, I meditate. When I don't feel like meditating, I sing in silence. I have lists of songs that I play on the double bass, cello, violin, Moroccan instrument, Chinese instrument and harp. There are about 40 songs altogether. While running I sing each song inwardly, only once. In this way, when I go out of the house I kill three or four birds at once.</p>
<p>This morning at 7:00 I went four miles. I sang very soulfully, in a prayerful way.</p>
<p>When I walk, my mind says, "Once upon a time, you used to walk at an 11 or 13-minute pace. Now you are walking at a 17 or 18-minute pace." So the mind brings discouragement. But then I play a trick on the mind. I say, "Yes, it is a 20-minute pace, but I am gaining in another way. I am meditating longer."</p>
<p>At home I have millions of problems to deal with. In these 20 minutes when I am walking, I am all by myself; so I am very happy. If I take three minutes more, who cares? Nature is helping true. With nature's beauty I am meditating. The mind brings discouragement, but then I tell my mind that for 20 minutes without interruption I am able to meditate. So the mind remains silent. We have to be super-smart when the mind wants to discourage us.</p>

<p>The other day I was walking to the tennis court. On the way an elderly Indian man came out of his house and said, "May I speak to you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Why?"</p>
<p>He said, "You are a great man. My daughter is getting married this Friday. I wish to invite you and your disciples. I wish to honour you."</p>
<p>I said, "Your daughter is getting married. This is her day. Why do you have to honour me?"</p>
<p>He said, "If you come to our house, you will bless our house and bless us."</p>
<p>I said, "You have my inner blessings."</p>
<p>He said, "I want your outer blessings."</p>
<p>"Please forgive me," I said, "I will not be able to come."</p>
<p>Then we shook hands and I went on.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The hat</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The hat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Today, first I walked two miles. Then I covered another eleven miles by running for 1400 metres and walking for the last 200 metres of each mile. I call this combination "running." Then I walked another half mile — for a total of thirteen and a half miles.</p>
<p>After the 1100-metre mark, near my seven-mile point, my hat was bothering me, so I took it off. Then I saw a beautiful lawn with a fence. I put the hat on one of the bars of the fence very nicely and left it in charge of God. I said, "God will take care of it. If it is His Will, He will keep it here."</p>
<p>Then I started jogging. After 40 metres I saw a gentleman smiling at me. God knows why he was smiling at me, but I also smiled at him. We were two gentlemen.</p>
<p>I went to the nine-mile mark and then started returning home. When I came to the seven-mile mark, I remembered that I had left my hat on the fence. I was about to look for it when I saw the same gentleman who had smiled at me holding the hat. He gave it to me and said, "I feel you are a nice man."</p>
<p>I said, "I know you are an excellent man!" Then he started laughing, and we shook hands.</p>
<p>This all happened right in front of his house. When I had left the hat there, at that time he had been 40 metres away. But when I came back, he was standing right in front of his house holding the hat. Can you imagine!</p>

<p>The other day a car was about to drive away from a gas station. It was waiting for the other cars to pass by so it could enter into the street. The driver was looking to this side and that side. I was running on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The car was not disturbing anybody, and I ran behind it. But just when I was behind it, the driver suddenly got the inspiration to go backward instead of forward. I shouted very loudly, at the top of my voice. What can you do with people like that? Luckily I escaped.</p>
