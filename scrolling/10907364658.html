<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Since I am your Guru, if you are sincere you will always feel that I am responsible for your meditation if you sincerely try to meditate but cannot do so. There are insincere people who will not get up to meditate early in the morning even once in three months. For these people I will not be responsible. But if you are trying, I will be responsible for your meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How should we concentrate on your transcendental picture?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How should we concentrate on your transcendental picture?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you want to concentrate, first look at my face, the whole face. Then gradually try to concentrate on my forehead. Then try to think of the place in between the eyebrows and a little above. Feel that only that particular spot exists, and there is nothing else. Try to bring your eyes to that point and feel at the same time that you don’t see anything else in the picture. Then try to dig there; go as deep as possible. Feel that you have got a knife, a divine knife, and you dig, dig, dig, and go as deep as you can. The deeper you go, the stronger will be your power of concentration.</p>
<p>Then, if you want to meditate, try to look at the whole picture. Try to feel that the entire picture is ready to give you whatever you want. If you want Peace, then try to look at the picture with the idea, the inner feeling, that the picture has infinite Peace. If you want Light, if you want Bliss, or anything divine, just feel that the picture has it, which is absolutely true.</p>
<p>To start with you have to have imagination, and then it becomes reality. Scientists discover so many things, but they have to start with imagination first. Then comes intuition and then comes realisation and reality. So, when you start, you have to imagine that this picture has what you want. Then go deep within and there you will find the reality. A day will come, in a few months or a year or two, when you won’t have to take help from your imagination. At that time, your own solid inner aspiration will make you feel what the picture has, what consciousness is there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Is my picture frightening you?</p>
<p><em>Yes!</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> What kind of crime have you committed that you have to be afraid of me? Who is afraid of me? A thief, a hooligan, a jailbird. You are none of those, so why should you be afraid of me? If somebody has done something very wrong, then they may be afraid of me. They will say that I shall expose all their secret inner defects and misdeeds. But, fortunately or unfortunately, here you will not be exposed. On the contrary, my compassion, like a mother, will hide your imperfections.</p>
<p>A spiritual Master is not an X-ray machine. With the X-ray machine, as soon as you stand in front of it, you are totally exposed. Similarly, when you stand in front of me, sooner than at once I can see everything, but I will be the last person to expose you to anybody, or complain about you to the Supreme, saying, “Look what a bad disciple I have.“ If I did, the Supreme would certainly say, “Who asked you to take this person?” When I accept someone as my disciple, as I have accepted you, I accept all his imperfections, real or imaginary.</p>
<p>You should never be afraid of me. I am not a tiger; I am not a lion. I am not going to devour anybody. Never! Even if you feel that you are darkness itself and I am the sun, no harm. Anything that the earthly sun shines on immediately is exposed. But the sun which shines within me is the inner sun, which only illumines. This sun can illumine your darkness, but it cannot expose it. If it shines on darkness, it transforms it, it transforms everything into divinity, and then offers this divinity to the world at large. So there is nothing for you to worry about.</p>
<p>Many times disciples, for one reason or another, create millions of imaginary imperfections. Real imperfections disciples do have, everybody has. But they also create imaginary imperfections, because they feel that if they can tell me about lots of imperfections, I will show them more compassion, concern and love. This is all wrong. If you have real imperfections and tell me about them cheerfully because you wish to transform them, at that time I can help you. But when you create imperfections in order to draw more attention and concern, at that time I withdraw, for I know that there is no truth in them.</p>
<p>I have heard many complaints that my transcendental picture is aloof, indifferent or frightening. I do not agree with these opinions, but if you insist that they are true, then please meditate on some other picture of me, even if that particular picture is not of my very highest consciousness or realisation. Any picture of me wearing my dhoti, taken in any Centre, is good for you to meditate on. I am sure in those pictures that my consciousness will be at least one inch higher than my disciples’ consciousness. As long as my consciousness in any picture is one inch higher than yours, you can meditate on that picture with complete confidence. If you feel that my smiling picture inspires you more, please use it. If you feel that in some other picture I am not indifferent, then meditate on that one. I tell my disciples to meditate on my transcendental picture, but if after two or three months you are not successful in this, it means that there is something wrong between you and the picture. Since there are hundreds of other pictures, please select one that will help you in meditation. There is no hard and fast rule that you have to use my transcendental picture.</p>
<p>I am telling all of you, please, please never to be afraid of me. You can be afraid of anything on earth, but don’t be afraid of me or of my transcendental picture. I will never harm you in any way. On the contrary, it is my business to transform your imperfections and mould and shape you into your own divinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When you call us up in front of the room to meditate facing the other disciples, what is the best approach for us to take?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When you call us up in front of the room to meditate facing the other disciples, what is the best approach for us to take?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you meditate in front of the disciples, you have to feel that your spiritual brothers and sisters are being inspired by you and, at the same time, that you are being inspired by them. When you stand and meditate with your utmost devotion, immediately they are inspired by you. And then, when you look at their faces, you get inspiration. You see that while you are helping the disciples, they are also helping you. It is not showing off. You are helping each other, without any competitive spirit. When you have that kind of feeling, that you are inspiring and being inspired, then your meditation will be most successful.</p>
<p>But do not meditate on the disciples. You know that I am behind you. And what do I represent at that time? I represent the heart’s identification. If you can identify your heart with mine, automatically you will have the inspiration to do extremely soulful meditation. You will feel me behind you as the heart. Then feel that I am standing in front of you and facing you, and that I am the sole witness. I am looking like a judge, to see whether you are meditating or not. You have to feel that I am before you as a judge, but behind you as your mother or father — identifying with you, encouraging you and inspiring you. With my soul I become the judge, and with my heart I become one with your aspiration.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Many disciples become self-conscious and nervous when called up to meditate in front of you or the other disciples. How can this be controlled?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Many disciples become self-conscious and nervous when called up to meditate in front of you or the other disciples. How can this be controlled?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I know that most of you are victims to this kind of self-conscious attitude and nervousness. Sometimes when I place my palm on your heads to bless you, I see and realise what nervousness and self-consciousness are.</p>
<p>When you are self-conscious, what happens? You become self-critical. You immediately feel that someone is observing you and you wonder what he is thinking of you. You may think, “Perhaps while looking at me Guru is seeing that early this morning I told a lie. Now my lying consciousness has come to the fore in me, and he has caught me.” Or you may think, “Is Guru observing the good thing that I did early in the morning? Does he know the wonderful thing I did?” Usually, self-consciousness takes a critical form, but it may be also a subtle feeling in which you demand appreciation.</p>
<p>But why should you feel that others are judging you? I am only feeding you with Peace, Light, Delight and Power. Others may judge you according to their light, but they are all fools. They do not know anything about your inner life. When you go to sit down, another person will come up to meditate, and he too will have told a lie or done something bad. You are all in the same boat. The best thing is to play your part with utmost sincerity; neither show off nor criticise yourself, but enter into your present aspiration. Then, when you come up in front of me to meditate, I shall receive only devoted qualities.</p>
<p>Another reason you become nervous is that you enter into the nervousness and uncertainty of others around you. It is like you are all students in front of an examiner. You do not know what question the examiner is going to ask, but you look around to see what page of the textbook the other person is studying. You do not pay attention to your own inner truth, but think that the question will come from the page the other person is reading. “Let me read that particular page,” you say. Then you start to become nervous, not because you are trying to read the same passage he is reading, but because the other person himself is nervous. He is reading a passage, but he also feels that perhaps this is not the right passage. Already he is uncertain, and when you start reading his passage, you enter into his consciousness and take on his uncertainty and fear.</p>
<p>How can you control your nervousness? In your life of aspiration you always have to feel, “If Guru asks me to do something, he has given me the capacity to do it. If he asks me to meditate in front of eighty or a hundred people, then he has definitely given me the capacity to do it well. He is not asking me in order to see how much capacity I have or how much I can show. He has already given me the capacity.” A mother will not put a very heavy burden on the shoulders of a child. The mother knows that the child will not be able to hold it that he will collapse. The mother gives the child only what she knows he can easily carry. Similarly, in the spiritual life, when I ask a disciple to come forward, I have already given him the necessary strength and capacity.</p>
<p>If you identify with me, you will never feel nervous. In my case there is no nervousness; it is all oneness. If I am absolutely one with you, I don’t have to worry about what I am doing, what I am offering, what you are thinking or how I can prove to you that I am sincere. I don’t have to prove to you that I am a spiritual man or a realised soul. Similarly, you don’t have to prove anything either. When you enter into me and become one with me, you enter into Peace, Light and Bliss in boundless measure. So the moment I ask you to come up and meditate, simply try to identify yourself with me. Identification never means imitation. Far from it! I don’t want you to be a carbon copy of me. I want you only to identify yourself with my highest consciousness, since you are crying for the Highest and you feel that the Highest is inside me. If you take that inner feeling as something true, throw yourself — body and soul — into me. Then you will see that there cannot be any self-conscious feeling or nervousness, but only certainty and a flood of reality and divinity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not everybody meditates with the same standard every day, but I will tell you how those who did best today meditated so if you want to try their way, you can also meditate well. X meditated best. When she meditated, I saw her soul’s integral identification with my highest consciousness inside her fully surrendered heart. Second came Y. She merged totally into my dynamic flood of Compassion-Light and my inner Beauty’s glory. Third was Z. He entered most devotedly into my all-fulfilling Consciousness with a divine child’s purity, loving surrender and certainty. Next was V. He meditated with his heart’s most intense inner cry to offer himself entirely in the service of the Supreme, with the inner assurance of becoming a chosen instrument of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you think that I am a divine child and you are playing with me, that is an excellent way of seeing me because at that time, my inner purity will enter into you. I always say God is an eternal Child. If you see me in the form of a child, in a childlike consciousness, it is very important that you also feel that you are a child. You have to put both of us at the same level — two children playing in the garden. You must feel that you are a child and I am a child with all divine and innocent qualities. Don’t think of yourself as an adult with a mind, or many thoughts or ideas. Also, do not think of yourself as a father and me as a divine child with whom you are playing. No, this is all wrong; there will be no balance. One is in the mind and one is in the heart. But if you can see and feel yourself as a child with only a heart, and feel that I am a child with only a heart, then two hearts are being blended into one and that is a very good form of meditation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know how far you have already walked along the path of spirituality. If you want to be a singer, you cannot become a good singer overnight. For a dancer also it takes time to learn to do the steps in perfect order. But eventually the dancer and the singer become experts. Then they can do many things at a time. When a doctor performs an operation, an ordinary person would be wonderstruck to see how many things he can concentrate on at once. When you are just learning to drive, you are nervous; but once you become an expert driver, you can look at this side and that side but everything is under perfect control.</p>
<p>How can we develop this kind of capacity? In the beginning, it is impossible. If somebody says he has entered into the spiritual life today and today he has this capacity, rest assured that he is fooling himself. But this capacity is like a muscle. When you take exercise, you develop your muscles. In the spiritual life also, if each day you practise meditation regularly, devotedly and soulfully, then you are bound to develop these inner capacities. Then, when you are in the office, when you are in school or when you are in some other place with your friends, you will feel an inner presence guiding you. Even if you talk about earthly, mundane things you will not lose the inner wealth that you have accumulated during your meditation.</p>
<p>In the beginning, perhaps the seeker starts with only five minutes of meditation early in the morning. Then a day comes when he can sit and meditate for half an hour, then an hour, then two hours; and he can meditate well more often, not just on rare occasions. Some people sit, but they are not meditating at all. But if somebody can meditate for two or three hours at a stretch with perfect equanimity, without losing his mental balance, naturally he has made some progress in his inner strength, inner power and inner light. Everything depends on the disciple’s achievement. Things he has really achieved in the spiritual life, he can use. If I have money, I can give it to you if I want to; but if I don’t have money, in spite of my best intentions, I will not be able to give it to you. Inner power, inner light and all the divine qualities are inside you. Your inner being has accumulated them. Now these qualities have to be brought to the fore.</p>
<p>We have to go to work, we have to go to the office or to school. Your classes may not be spiritual at all. Others are trying to create problems; they are trying to influence you unconsciously or consciously. You become a victim to their merciless treatment, and then you are totally lost. But if your inner being supplies you with your own inner peace and joy, then you will be able to swallow their undivine behaviour. You will be answering your professor’s questions or talking to your boss, but inside you will feel the presence of your own inner being which helped you when you were meditating early in the morning. You will feel its presence like a divine child within you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If your meditation is very high, very powerful, fire is emanating from your eyes. Then if one who is cherishing worldly thoughts looks at you, he will be compelled to give up those thoughts. Many times I have seen when three or four aspirants meditate together, if one of them is in a very high meditation, then the others have to leave the place or are compelled from within to meditate soulfully.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we meditate twenty-four hours a day?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we meditate twenty-four hours a day?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Nobody can meditate twenty-four hours a day. If you are always meditating, who will run your shop? People will come to buy your merchandise, and you will not be interested. So how are you going to sustain and manage your life if you are seated at one place twenty-four hours daily? First of all, you cannot constantly sit and meditate. It is impossible; you would die. Second, the world demands your attention and concern.</p>
<p>Your question should be, “How is it possible for us to have constant aspiration?” Constant aspiration you can have in each activity. Right now you are meditating here. From here you will go home and eat. When you are eating, instead of thinking of the outer world, you can meditate, or think of your Master. You can think of love, purest love, and how you can love the whole world. You can think of devotion and how you can devote your whole life to your Inner Pilot. You can think of surrender and how you can surrender your ignorant life to God. When you harbour these divine thoughts in your mind instead of undivine, silly thoughts, worldly thoughts, then what are you doing? You are meditating. People will think that you are doing nothing but eating. But you are doing something infinitely more significant.</p>
<p>Like this you can constantly aspire while you are in the store. It is not the money you get from the customer that is important. You are giving what you have and the customer is giving you what he has. But while you are giving, you have to feel that you are offering the light that you have in the form of the things you sell. And when a person gives you a five dollar bill or a ten dollar bill, don’t think of it as money, but think that that person is giving you light. Then your light and his light become one and when you are conducting your business in light — in your light and his light — you are aspiring.</p>
<p>In each activity you can bring down light and this light is the highest form of aspiration. Whatever you do, see the divine part, not the human part or earthly part, in your action. In this way you can constantly meditate for twenty-four hours. While you are talking and moving about, ask yourself what your attitude is, where your consciousness lies. Where your consciousness lies is of paramount importance. If you want to be totally conscious of the Highest even in your deep sleep, you can have this capacity if you constantly aspire twenty-four hours a day. The opportunity to aspire is given in and through each activity of yours. In each of your actions you can aspire.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the individual soul to cry for God in the heart of his meditation. It is the duty of the divine soul to constantly guide and assure the individual soul on its eternal journey. When a cry goes up, immediately assurance, God's Blessing-Assurance descends. In the past several years Sri Chinmoy has been approached by untold numbers of aspirants seeking his inner and outer assurance in their life of aspiration. This book, a collection of questions and answers, represents a portion of that dialogue.</p>
