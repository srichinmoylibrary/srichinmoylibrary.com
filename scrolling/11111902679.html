<p>This morning I almost had an accident. One fellow had stopped at a red light but his car was still moving as I was running across the street. He was just looking to one side and so I had to bang on his car, because he didn't know what he was doing. Of course, I banged on it very politely.</p>

<p>I was running across an intersection in San Juan. One car was coming from one direction and another was coming from the other. One of them had a red light and one of them had a green light. At the intersection, the driver of the second car got inspired. All of a sudden, instead of waiting at the red light for the other car, which had a green light, he took a shortcut through the intersection. I screamed.</p>
<p>A gentleman with a briefcase was crossing the street at the time. He started chasing the car and screaming, using all American vulgar terms. He even crossed the street and followed the car for 50 metres. Then he began cursing himself, saying that instead of running after the car he should have taken down its license number.</p>
<p>He came up to me and said, "I can see you are a nice guy." He said he also runs and a few days ago he had had a similar experience. How badly they drive in San Juan!</p>

<p>Today I saw one of my disciples running, about 200 metres ahead of me. Then my ego came forward and I said, "Just because her husband defeats me, that doesn't mean that she will defeat me."</p>
<p>So I ran past her, and then I ran practically 200 metres more.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a policeman smiled at me and spoke to me in Spanish.</p>

<p>There was a very big puddle about 400 metres from the Centre, near Lilo's Health Food Store. A lady was driving by quite fast, but she stopped her car in the middle of the street so that she would not splash me. Perhaps she had seen me somewhere â€” on television or in the newspaper. She asked, "Master, when did you come? How do you do?" The people waiting in the cars behind her were blessing her.</p>

<p>Every day, at about four in the morning, I run down Ashford Avenue, but it is so dark that I can never really see it. Then, during the day when I ride in the car down Ashford Avenue, it looks so different. I can't believe that I have run that far. I can only marvel and say to the disciples with me, "Look how far I have run!"</p>

<p>On the way to Jamaica High School I saw a man about my age wearing a suit. He looked like a perfect gentleman, and he had a briefcase in his hand. As soon as I crossed the street and ran past him, he gave me a very, very broad smile.</p>
<p>You know I may be miserly in other fields, but not in offering smiles. So I also gave him a very broad smile, but I didn't stop running.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I heard someone running behind me. I turned around and saw the same gentleman running after me. This time he was almost shaking with a kind of reverential awe.</p>
<p>"Are you Sri Chinmoy?" he asked. Usually I can't speak when I run. It takes time for me to catch my breath. So I just looked at him and again gave him a very good smile.</p>
<p>Then he said, "What a precious man and what a precious morning!" I continued running. When I had covered another ten metres, I turned around and I saw him still standing there, looking at me.</p>

<p>Today I saw a dog that I have seen a few times before. But for the first time I also saw the owner. It was an elderly woman, and she was holding the dog on a leash.</p>
<p>As I ran by, the dog blocked my way, so I just stopped and stood there. The dog was not barking at all and the lady said to me, "Don't worry, don't worry! She is as kind as any human being can ever be. She can be your best friend as well, if you want her to be.</p>
<p>I said to the lady, "Thank you, thank you."</p>
<p>Her dog can be her best friend, so true. After running a few more metres I turned around, and the lady was still looking at me.</p>

<p>When I run up the hill on 150th Street, always I come and stop at a particular tree. I breathe in four times and then again I resume my running.</p>
<p>The other day, one of the disciples told me that she was parking her car near there when a lady said to her, "I saw your leader this morning. I see him every day. He goes running up the hill and he stops right by that tree. He looks so thirsty, I want to give him a glass of water, but I know I can't. Your leader is so terrific. You're so lucky to have such a good leader. He's such a wonderful man."</p>
<p>I think she is one of the ladies who had the fight with another lady and her dog a few months ago by the bus stop.</p>

<p>The other day I entered into Flushing Meadow Park and I happened to see one of the disciples. On other days when he sees me or when I see him, he runs quite fast. But on that particular day he was running so slowly. I said, "Today is not his day."</p>

<p>Yesterday in Flushing Meadow Park a group of black and white girls were playing with a doll on the grass. I was running by on the street when all of a sudden one of the black girls came into the street. She was quite fat and short, and she stood blocking my way and showing her muscles. I stopped running and went two metres to the right, and then I started running again. How she was flexing her muscles!</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was running near the start of the Road Runners' 100-mile race. I was running slowly. Near the bridge there were five or six young boys and one girl, all black. When I came by, they started using all their American slang and pointing at me, but I didn't pay any attention.</p>
<p>But O God, one girl didn't stop at just cutting jokes. In two minutes' time she started running side by side with me. All American rubbish language she was saying, but I was deaf and dumb, absolutely not answering. She ran with me for about 150 metres. She was holding a baton or small stick. Finally, she threw it at me, but fortunately it did not strike me. Then she ran back to her friends.</p>
<p>That is why I ask my disciples, especially the women, to be very, very careful while running. I am an older man and yesterday I was wearing a running outfit and looking smart, too. But still they were joking and disturbing me. So please be very, very careful when you run.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was returning home after having covered only two miles. Suddenly, somebody from behind said, "Hey, hey! Hello, hello! Hello, Guru!" Now, you guess who it was. It was one of my disciples.</p>
<p>Then I told him to run according to his own speed. So he ran very fast, but he halted at an intersection. I continued running and I came very near him â€” 100 or 150 metres away. I was watching him. There was no car there, no red light, nothing. Even then he was waiting there. I said, "Oh, he is my perfect disciple. He can say that he is at an intersection, so it is all right to take rest there."</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, around 5:30 in the morning, three dogs came running after me. One little dog ran very fast and came within a metre of me. He wasn't barking; he was just running. I didn't even see this dog until it tried to bite my ankle. Luckily, a car went by and the noise scared the dog away.</p>

<p>This morning, while I was running near the Grand Central Parkway, a man said, "Wait!" So I stopped and waited, but I didn't know what he wanted. Then he said, "This will be cooler," and he sprayed me with a hose.</p>
<p>He asked me where I was from. I told him, "India," and I asked him where he was from. He said, "Ireland." He was very happy to learn that I had been to Ireland a few years ago and had met the President. On my way back I again saw him working in his garden. I waved to him and he said,</p>
