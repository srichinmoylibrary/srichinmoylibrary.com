<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The intellect is very limited, but the soul is unlimited. For this reason an aspirant dives deep into the inmost recesses of his heart, for it is there that the soul abides. The Truth can be known only through aspiration. The true attributes of God are Peace, Light, Bliss and Power. These attributes all exist in boundless measure in the heart of Eternity. Only the seeker of Truth who aspires to go beyond the domain of the intellect can enter into the Light, Peace, Bliss and Power of the highest Absolute. Not intellect, but psychic aspiration is needed to know and to realise the attributes of God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you aspire for the inner cry, you should know that that very cry comes from God's Concern and Compassion. So the most important thing is to offer your gratitude. If you offer gratitude, then immediately your inner cry increases. It becomes continuous and constant. When you offer gratitude, your inner cry mounts to the highest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can I have more will power and clarity?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can I have more will power and clarity?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Unfortunately, very often when we think of will power, we think of it as being inside our head, inside our brain. We never think of will power here in the heart centre. We feel that the heart is feminine and the mind is masculine. In the mind there is a tiger, a lion or a bull there to fight. This is our human conception. But it is not true that will power is inside the head. Will power is inside the third eye, and the third eye is not inside our physical head. None of the centres are inside the physical. If they were there, medical science would have discovered them long ago. Real will power is also inside the heart. The soul's light is will power, real will power. The easiest and most effective way to cultivate will power is to concentrate on the heart. Two years ago I gave two or three exercises on the physical plane on how to develop will power. They were printed in one of my books, I am sure. So read these and you can develop will power. From your will power you can have mental clarity.</p>
<p>You also want clarity. Now you are in darkness and if you have a little light, then you can walk, you can see what is around you. So if you can get even an iota of soul's light, I tell you, you will be able to see everything and walk along the darkest path if you want to. If you can see or feel the soul's light, it becomes all illumination. So, if you want clarity in your mind, concentrate on your heart and then dig there. Think that you have a tool to dig with, and every day dig. But don't be satisfied with your digging. Today you have dug and you have come to a certain point. Then tomorrow again you have to dig further. The deeper you can go, the sooner you will feel and see the light. First you feel, then you see, then you become. First you will feel that there is something inside like a very tiny insect: that is the light. Then you will see it with your inner vision or with your human vision. Finally you will grow into it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have to do first things first. Who has satisfaction? Who is satisfaction? God. So if we do the first thing first, if we pray and meditate on God, then satisfaction is at our disposal. If we go deep within, we see that satisfaction is there.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God has countless children. Of all His children, He loves Peace the most precisely because Peace does not know and Peace does not need anything more than what God has and what God is, which is Peace.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, they are not. Love is oneness; awareness is not oneness. You can be aware of an incident or an event; you can be aware of a person or an accident or a movement; but that does not mean that you are inseparably one with the person or the event.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to feel that there is something called the heart. You do not have to go to a spiritual Master in order to know that you have a heart of your own. Between the two lungs is the physical heart and the spiritual heart is also there. Then, you have to feel that inside the heart there is something called the soul. First go into the heart and feel that inside the heart you are trying to unlock another door. That is the door of the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There is only a slight difference between delight and bliss. You can see the difference between delight and bliss in a very simple way. Delight takes a liquid form. It is like water, a vast expanse. Bliss is something thick and condensed. Bliss does not spread. It does not have the capacity nor does it want to spread. Everything it has; it stays in one place. But delight flows and spreads. Bliss does not want expansion, but delight wants expansion, the expansion of its capacity. Also, in delight there is subtlety, transparency and light. Inside delight there is light in a flowing form. Light is flowing in delight.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Should we try to justify our spiritual practices to others?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Should we try to justify our spiritual practices to others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, that is a mistake. When we try to convince others that what we are doing is right, in a certain sense we unconsciously try to convert them. If we know that we are doing the right thing, then we should simply do it. We know that the right thing for us to do early in the morning is to pray and meditate. But we will not go to our neighbour who is fast asleep at the time of at the time of our meditation and tell him to get up because it is the right thing to do. We will not say, "Look, I am praying and meditating; I am doing the right thing. You must not sleep at this hour, you also must get up." If we say that kind of thing, then our neighbour will simply say, "Mind your own business!".</p>
<p>In the spiritual life we don't try to justify ourselves. We just live for ourselves, for the God within us. God has told us to pray and meditate on Him.</p>
<p>When the time comes for others to pray and meditate then God will illumine and awaken them. But if we go to them and say, "Look, we are doing the right thing and you are doing the wrong thing; it is our duty to awaken you and illumine you," then we will not be helping their spiritual progress in any way.</p>
<p>Let us stay with our own conviction. But if somebody challenges us and tells us that we are doing the wrong thing, at that time for a few minutes we can justify what we are doing. Even then I feel it is definitely better not to enter into an argument. If they say that we are doing everything wrong, then all right, let them say it. Justification is not illumination; not at all. The mind is so tricky. Even when we try to justify our own cause we don't get illumination. This moment the mind has taken the side of the heart. That is why the mind is trying to justify the heart's cause. The next moment, if the mind is separated from the heart, the mind will try to fight against the heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does each person have a different way of meditating?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does each person have a different way of meditating?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want peace, then you have to meditate on peace. If you want love, then you have to meditate on love. If you want joy or any other divine quality, the best thing is to meditate on it. That is the only way you can get these qualities. Each individual will have a different way of meditating because his mind or his heart will want different qualities. You will be knocking at a particular door and somebody else will be knocking at another door. Each one has his own way.</p>
<p>The general rule for my students is to knock at my heart's door. That is an absolutely general rule. Once the door is open, if you want to go to the kitchen, you go. If you want to go to the living room, you go. If you want to go to my study you go. If you want to go to the meditation room, you go. But the general rule is to open the door first and then select the room that you want to enter.</p>
<p>In the heart there is no necessity of justification; it is all illumination. In the heart we see light which does not have to justify its existence. The sun does not have to justify its existence on earth. Light is light. Its very presence is illumination. When we accept the spiritual life, it is all aspiration. Aspiration itself is light, illumination.</p>
<p>We try to justify ourselves when we see that somebody is doubting us and we feel sure of what we are doing. If we are really sure, then immediately our justification capacity comes forward to prove that we are doing the right thing. But if we know that we are doing the right thing and we also are the right thing, then we don't have to justify. Let us become the sun. The sun does not justify its light because it knows that it is light itself.</p>
