  <h2 id="page-title">The formless</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The formless" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We go to the formless only through the form. We go to the Infinite via the finite. To go beyond the form, we are going through the form. There is Leonard Bernstein the man and Leonard Bernstein the divine composer and supreme conductor.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> How can I go beyond the man when you keep reminding me of him with these two words?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An Indian mantra is like that. By repeating and repeating a mantra we grow into the very essence and quintessence of the mantra.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I have my mantra. It was given to me in the name of a cosmic god. It was very beautiful when I received my mantra. There were offerings of flowers, vegetables and dried things from the fields. I never get tired of my mantra but I get very tired of my name because it confines me; it restricts me to an individual person. The wonderful thing about a mantra is that it is not your name. You can forget your name and become what you are with this incredible leader.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Your name may confine you, but it illumines us in the world of music. It may confine you because it is your name. But, in our case, when your name enters into our minds or into our hearts, immediately it throws us into an ocean of musical light and delight.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I can understand that being somebody else's mantra, but for myself, it confines me. It can open gates, but not for me because it always makes me feel confined. I understand you; that is the main thing. But what I don't understand is them <em>(pointing to the Singers)</em>. The memorisation of so many units of information — bits, as they say in information theory — millions and millions of bits of accents and notes and syllables and words and combinations. I don't understand it.</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> But when you conduct a classical work by heart, you have to memorise so many more things.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But I could not sit in the orchestra and play one of the parts. I could have the overall picture. I could be a Rabbi, a teacher, and show them what they cannot see because they are confined to one part, just as each of you is confined to his or her part. So <em>(turning to Haridas)</em> I can understand your function. But all those people that I conduct have notes in front of them, as well as all the remarks and observations that I have made to them. To some it's a revelation and to some it's just information. But they have it all written in front of them. But you have it all here <em>(pointing to his head)</em> or here <em>(pointing to his heart)</em> or wherever it is. And my admiration is just unbounded. I can't understand it. I kneel before that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Our admiration is boundless</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Our admiration is boundless" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our admiration for you is also boundless. Just recently in Central Park, you gave so much joy to 500,000 people — not for a fleeting second but for hours. It is beyond the flight of our imagination how a single God-lover can inspire, illumine and give joy to 500,000 people. For us, this is something unheard of!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> I think the secret is what you said about not a fleeting second. The secret of music is that it makes time stop. We are all prisoners of clock time: "I have to be at my job" or "I have to see my wife" or "I promised I would be there at eight o'clock and it's now that time." What music does is release you from that, so that you can be in the time of the music. And though it may last 35 minutes or 65 minutes, it's an eternity because within the dimensions of each composition there exists an eternal time, which is the time of that composition. Even if it's a little piece like the "Marriage of Figaro Overture," which is four minutes, while you are listening to that Overture, you are in cosmic time. It could be the equivalent of four years of experience — a lifetime! And if it's "Tristan and Isolde," which is four and a half hours plus intermissions, then that's another kind of lifetime that you live during the duration of the music. Some kinds of time cannot be counted. It's neither hours nor minutes nor seconds, but the time that is expressed by the genius who wrote the music: Mozart, Wagner, Stravinski or whoever it is. And it's a great privilege to live in that piece of time — to exist within that piece of music forever. It is a privilege like being with Sri Chinmoy. It is timeless, whatever the duration of the work is. While in this world, you don't have to make an appointment. You don't have to rush. You just listen for the next inevitable note or chord or pause. Those of us who are musical are privileged to have that experience. You are all so musical. How do you sing so well in tune? I don't understand that either.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> It does not always happen.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You mean he has to correct you a lot? I never could sing in tune even when I had a decent voice — before it got ruined by cigarettes and screaming at orchestras. I hear the notes exactly, but what comes out of my mouth are ugly toads, and they get uglier all the time. When I sing something for an orchestra to show them how I mean it to sound, they say, "What?" I say, "Well, you know what I mean." I know that it's the wrong notes and the wrong key, but they always know what I mean. But if I had to be one of you and sing in this chorus, I couldn't do it. I would love to be able to do that.</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> I invite you.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> You would regret that invitation, I assure you; you would rue the day that you ever asked me because I would ruin your chorus. I can't sing two phrases in tune. <em>(He sings "Leonard Bernstein.")</em> Is that right?</p>
<p><em>Haridas:</em> It is perfect!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> No, it's not perfect! I have often thought that I would exchange all the gifts that I have been blessed with from Heaven if I could only have the ability to sing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Then what would happen to those who have got such inspiration, joy and satisfaction in life from you? If you want to change your field, what will happen to them?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> If I could sing, if I could get out on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House and make people thrill to the ringing conviction of my resounding baritone, I would give everything up. Singing is what it is all about. That's all I try to do with the orchestra. That's what I try to teach and try to do on the piano. That's why I admire so much what you are doing. King David sang his psalms before the Lord on the steps of the temple with his musicians accompanying him. One hundred and fifty-odd psalms — no small repertoire, but it is nothing compared to Sri Chinmoy's! That is my ideal in life — to be able to sing like David and praise God. Maybe I did it in a former life. Maybe I used to be a second-rate baritone in an opera company.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Perhaps you did everything, so now you are fed up with it. Now you are giving a new experience to the world. I would like to offer you this.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Oh, not something else! You gave me this, you gave me that, you gave me so much!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is something for your birthday. Better late than never!</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein (looking at the cake with his picture etched in icing):</em> Who is that silly looking man?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (to the choir):</em> Please sing the Happy Birthday song.</p>
<p><em>(Choir sings "Happy Birthday" and at the end Leonard Bernstein conducts them.)</em></p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Thank you very much. You are godly people <em>(clasps Sri Chinmoy's hands)</em>. It is a privilege to be with you. Have yourselves a piece of cake. I mean it. Is there somebody with a cake knife? You deserve at least a piece of cake. You are probably all very hungry. It is way past your dinner time.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Would you kindly come to our tennis court to play tennis?</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> Sunday I am going to Europe and I will be gone for a month or more. When I come back, I think it will be post-tennis time. It will be late October. Then until March I am a composer. I am very busy. That is the hardest work I do — much harder than all this public stuff. I am very private, and I am usually in Connecticut, most of the time alone, just seeking these notes. It is hard work, but at least I can control my own schedule. I am off the clock. That's like being in a piece of music. If I want to work all night, I can, and I can sleep in the day, or the other way around. I can play tennis or meditate or walk in the woods. I love that. It is very lonely. It is a completely different kind of life from the one I have now, which is with many people and photographers and newspaper people from Paris and Hong Kong. They are around all the time.</p>
<p>Did you people get a piece of cake?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> On the way out, we will be able to take some cake.</p>
<p><em>Leonard Bernstein:</em> But I would like to see you eating it now. I would like to see you happy and well fed. <em>(He embraces Sri Chinmoy.)</em> I don't know what to say. I am just overwhelmed by the perfection. Perfection is your key word.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We are all dreamers of perfection, but perfection is still a far cry.</p>
<p><em>(Leonard Bernstein speaks with Haridas briefly in French, then chats with the singers as they leave.)</em></p>

<p>Leonard Bernstein passed away on 14 October 1990. A memorial tribute to him was held at the United Nations in New York on 6 November by <em>Sri Chinmoy: The Peace Meditation at the United Nations</em>.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy opened the programme with a period of silent meditation. A video was then shown of the choir performing Sri Chinmoy's song for Leonard Bernstein at the Maestro's apartment.</p>
<p>Following this, a number of delegates and staff members offered words of appreciation and gratitude for Leonard Bernstein's deeply significant offerings to humanity during the course of his life.</p>
<p>On 14 October 1993 Sri Chinmoy offered a Peace Concert at the Medical Association Hall in Miyazaki, Japan. He dedicated the concert to Leonard Bernstein on the third anniversary of his passing:</p>
<p>"Today's Peace Concert I am most lovingly and most gratefully dedicating to the immortal emperor-musician-conductor Leonard Bernstein, the third anniversary of whose passing takes place today. On two occasions he showered his blessings, compassion and encouragement upon me and my talented singers. His heart of compassion and love, encouragement, warmth and oneness my students and I shall forever cherish in the very depth of our gratitude-heart."</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Biographical Note</h2>

<p>Yehudi Menuhin was born in America in 1916 of Russian parents.

He made his debut with an orchestra at the age of eleven in New York. In 1959 he moved to London and became a British subject in 1985.</p>
<p>Since 1945 he has toured extensively all over the world and is greatly admired for his love of both Eastern and Western musical traditions. In 1974 he recorded an album with legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar. He has founded yearly music festivals in Gstaad (Switzerland), Bath and Windsor. He has conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra since 1982 and the English String Orchestra since 1988. He has also directed and conducted the Asian Youth Orchestra.</p>
<p>Mr. Menuhin has received many honours and awards for his musical contributions, including the Nehru Award for International Peace and Understanding (1970), the 30th Anniversary Medal of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France). In 1993 he was created a Baron (Life Peer) of Stoke D'Abernon in the County of Surrey.</p>

<p><em>On 3 February 1992, Maestro Yehudi Menuhin warmly welcomed Sri Chinmoy and some of his students into his suite at the Rihga Hotel in New York City. During the hour-long meeting, they discussed music and spirituality, and Sri Chinmoy and his students performed several songs by Sri Chinmoy in the Maestro's honour. Following is a transcript of that meeting.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> This is the greatest good fortune, because I have been wanting to meet you for a good many years. Once when I was going out to some college on Long Island, one of those people whom you've inspired tried to arrange something, but unfortunately it didn't happen. Then again last night at my concert, he turned up. Is he here?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> He's the one! He turned up, and I said, "Well, all right, I will be here tomorrow."</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Never give up! For the last 15 years I have been most devotedly longing to meet with you, and now God has fulfilled my long-cherished desire.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I'm always afraid that people who have looked forward to meeting me will be very disappointed. They've looked forward too long, and here I am — just a very, very ordinary human being.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, no! At God's choice Hour everything takes place. This is God's choice Hour for us to meet.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, I suppose there is a certain destiny, a certain fatality about events. Some of the events are beyond our control, aren't they? Some people don't believe in accidents at all. I don't really know. There must be some sort of reckoning that doesn't necessarily depend on a universal computer. It depends on what our thinking and our feeling generate in the whole world.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Yoga</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Yoga" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have been practising yoga for so many years. Yoga goes beyond the domain of science and technology, as you know. Yoga means oneness with the universal consciousness, which is far beyond the domain of the mind. The capacity of the mind is quite limited, whereas the capacity of the heart-which you have and you are-is unlimited. People love, appreciate and admire you because of your inseparable oneness with the universal heart, the universal life and the universal consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I have just followed what was offered to me. The first time I was in India, I felt overwhelmed by a world so different from anything I had known. And yet, I had always wanted to go to the East. Most people have gone to the West to find new things.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We come to the West mostly for material wealth. When we go to the East, it is for inner wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, it's true. And I found that there were so many aspects of thought to be considered. Good and evil have always bothered me. In the West we try to separate the two and put evil in prison. We imagine we can create perfect good around us, which is childish nonsense.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> According to Indian philosophy, we feel that evil is a part of ignorance. Evil is simply lesser light. There is abundant, infinite light; again, there is lesser light. When we compare this lesser light, this iota of light, with the infinite light, we call it evil.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, but as long as we are human beings, as long as we are not pure in thought and as long as we have to deal with our survival, don't you think that good and evil are very much intertwined?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now they are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. But on the strength of our prayer and meditation, we are hoping that there shall come a time when ignorance itself will be transformed into light. A day shall come when this ignorance-night will be transformed into wisdom-delight by virtue of our soulful prayers and meditations.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Buddhist chanting</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Buddhist chanting" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I do believe there are various Buddhist forms of chanting which are wonderful, wonderful things. There is a Buddhist sect in Japan that regards chanting as the principal act of belonging to a better world. I think that's very important.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you would permit us, we could start by chanting one of the main Buddhist chants or mantras. The Buddha's followers chant, <em>Buddham saranam gacchami. Dhammam saranam gacchami. Sangham saranam gacchami.</em> My students could start with this prayerful Buddhist mantra if you would permit it.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I'd love it, I'd love it!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been to Japan a few times, and we have chanted at Kamakura in front of that most powerful statue of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I believe that music is part of our lives, and that we can learn a great deal from listening and from playing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Music, for me, is the very breath of our universal existence. Inside our body is the heart and inside the heart is our breath.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I feel music is a point where the tangible and the intangible meet. It goes directly through our ears into our body, and we are subject to the vibrations of the whole universe. It's an art of constructing a work of art in time, because a piece of music is a bit of life; it's a stretch of life. You live that music. Instead of living yourself, you live that music.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the finite that stretches itself into Infinity. When music stretches itself into Infinity, the breath of music enters into the Cosmic Life.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, it's true. Of course, that is especially true of the chant. In the West it has taken the form of an organised structure like a play or a poem or a novel. What impressed me about the music of India was that, like the civilisation and the river Ganges, it has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is an eternal flow.</p>
<p><em>(Singers perform "Buddham saranam gacchami.")</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Beautiful! I love the long, long notes and the meditative quality from one note to another. It's a quality that is specific to religious music as opposed to folk music. This similar to a Gregorian chant in unison, as we had in the Middle Ages. It has very little rhythm; it is music at the service of thought and words. Are the words here determining to a large extent the music? The words are holy, aren't they?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The meaning of the chant is "I go to the Buddha for refuge. I go to the Dharma for refuge. I go to the Order for refuge."</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, they are the eternal words that we dream of and meditate on-words that last a long, long, long, long time. They give a certain peace, a wonderful sense of serenity. It's not a beat like an African beat. It's another part of life that demands recognition. It's our heartbeat.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Silence and sound go together.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, but they are also separate. One is the beat of life, the rhythm of our pulse-of our vibrations themselves. The other is what we dream of-a certain form of dedication and serenity. But you have to have a mood for it. I don't think that if you chanted that on 42nd Street, it would work. That's why people build temples. They build temples to house that spirit. And then you go into the temple in the right mood. You have transformed this room into a temple, and that is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Last night when I learned that I would be fortunate enough to meet with you, I was immediately inspired to compose a soulful song in your honour. It was at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I am very grateful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> And this morning I was inspired to compose another song. Unfortunately, they did not have a chance to learn it, so I have to sing it.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> That's very, very sweet. I'm very, very touched. You shouldn't have. I feel totally unworthy of this.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (showing some photographs of his meetings with other musicians):</em> This is Pablo Casals. He was shedding tears when we met and saying, "In the evening of my life, you have come." He played his cello for me. It happened in Puerto Rico many, many years ago.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, I knew him very well. Very interesting.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In Manhattan we met Leonard Bernstein twice. Each meeting we started with a meditation.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Lenny Bernstein's lifestyle was quite different.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But when he was with us, he was always fond of meditating.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> He was a genius, a remarkable man, a marvellous man. But he was torn inside. <em>(Sri Chinmoy shows photographs of his meetings with Zubin Mehta, Kurt Masur, Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan. Then he presents Mr. Menuhin with a copy of the song that he has composed about him.)</em></p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Song</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Song" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is the song they are going to sing.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> When you see it that way, you realise the great chasm there is between the printed notes and the actual act of singing.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They will be singing it now.</p>
<p><em>(Singers perform the song.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Thank you. You learned that by heart? It's wonderful. You know, it's a dreadful habit to look at music. One should forget about it. It's wonderful that you sing it from memory. <em>(To Sri Chinmoy)</em> Did you teach it?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> Yes, he taught it to us personally. He always insists that we not use the music.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> Last night he taught it to us.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> What was the process? Did you think of the music?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> No, he writes the words and then he composes the music to the words. He wrote the entire song on a little keyboard.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> And then you chant it?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> He teaches us the music and we write it out in Western notation and learn it. He has written thousands of devotional songs. And just as you said, he encourages us not to use the music because when we look at music, we're using our minds, whereas when we sing without the music, we're using our hearts. This is what he encourages us to do: sing these songs with our hearts and souls.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, I think it's amazing the way you sing together, and without having music. So none of you ever looked at the music?</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> We studied the music and learned it by heart.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> Sri Chinmoy has us sing it over and over until we get it as he wants us to sing it.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, that is very effective. And you probably have quite a repertoire.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, literally hundreds and hundreds of songs they know by heart. I have composed about 6,000 songs in Bengali and another 3,000 in English. Here is the song I wrote during the day. They had to go to work this morning, so they could not learn this.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy reads the words to the second song he composed in Mr. Menuhin's honour.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I don't deserve anything.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> May I sing it for you?</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I should get on my knees for this.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy (sits down at the harmonium):</em> And also, I have set to music two most significant utterances of yours. <em>(Reads words.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> How do you teach your group?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We live in Jamaica, Queens, and meet together at least two or three times a week to pray and meditate. We take soulful music as part of our spiritual life. When we sing soulfully, we feel we are praying to God.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Do you also give lectures, or is it just prayer, meditation and singing?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have given talks all over the world-in most of the major universities. The talks are about Indian philosophy and our spiritual way of life. I have been praying and meditating since my childhood.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, I can believe that.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Indian philosophy</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Indian philosophy" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have studied our Indian philosophy thoroughly — the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita and all the other major sacred books. On the basis of these teachings and also my own inner awakening, I have been offering my soulful services in many parts of the world over the past 28 years. Also I have been serving at the United Nations for the last 22 years. Every Tuesday and Friday I go there to pray and meditate, and the delegates, diplomats and staff who are interested in praying and meditating come and join me.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Through this meditating and singing and through your wonderful talks, do your students acquire an attitude about contemporary life and what is happening in the world?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, our way is not the way of renunciation. Our way is the way of acceptance. We have accepted the world as such and we are trying to better it through our prayers and meditations. We do not reject or shun the world, far from it! We accept the world as it is with the hope that we can be of service to improve the world and help it to have a better consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> The only way I know, the best way, is to improve ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. We all belong to the same life-tree. Some are leaves, others are flowers and others are fruits. But we belong to the same life-tree. When we pray and meditate soulfully, we consciously feel our inseparable oneness with the world.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> And you've probably found it most effective not to join pressure groups or to express opinions that will create enemies.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Only we try to establish our brotherhood. We do not believe in superiority and inferiority. It is universality that we want: I belong to you; you belong to me. We are one. We always sing the song of oneness. We do not believe in separativity. We believe in unity.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I think that is the best way.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy sings, accompanying himself on the harmonium.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Very, very sweet.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> "I have never resigned myself." This is your most powerful message. Please forgive my audacity for setting tune to your words.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> It's extraordinary the way you put the words to the music. The act of making the music is a meditation on the subject, which is not necessarily passive.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we meditate on that subject, we feel that we get its full significance; we derive the utmost blessingful message from the utterance.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> It probably also means that you can keep your balance of mind even under situations that would, without your training, create a violent reaction. Have you all overcome the impulse to react violently to evil? Do you ever lose that serenity?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Occasionally, for a fleeting moment, but we do not resort to physical violence. Only sometimes, as human beings, we are subject to weaknesses-anger, insecurity, jealousy and so forth. But because we pray and meditate, we feel that we are diminishing those lower qualities or propensities. That is why we practise yoga, as you also do. You know it has helped you immensely to create serenity in your mind.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> I am sure this is an extraordinary discipline. It is a wonderful, wonderful thing to be able to get over the normal reaction to situations. However, I trust you and believe you and admire you. And I would forgive you a thousand times if, in spite of this, once in a while you did get angry. I know myself, I am not inured against that reaction. Sometimes I can get very upset.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But in the depth of your heart you do not mean it. A student of yours has misbehaved, let us say, and you are furious, but in the depth of your heart you are calm. It is like the bottom of the ocean. The bottom of the ocean is calm and quiet, but on the surface the waves are surging.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> At this moment, if you offered me a choice, I'd rather be on the surface.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That means you want things to be done. In that case, sometimes it is necessary to show anger. If you only speak to your students kindly and compassionately, it may do no good. But if you show your tempestuous anger, then you will be able to achieve your objective in the twinkling of an eye. If you want something to be done, if you want your students to become better musicians, sometimes you have no choice but to resort to anger.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> My mother is like that. She is 96 years old. She could control her anger and direct it so that it had the proper effect. But it was absolutely controlled and she remained relatively calm inside. However, I'm not like that. I can't pretend that I get angry only to bring out the best in other people. I sometimes get angry just because I get angry.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are angry because you want something to be done. You want perfection in the other person's life, and you feel that showing anger is the only way you can create perfection in that individual. Otherwise, by nature you are calm and compassionate. Your whole life is full of compassion. Anger is something foreign that enters into you. A foreigner comes and stays for a few seconds.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are of Russian origin. I come from India. A few years ago I composed a Bengali song about the oneness of Russia and India. May I sing the song? The literal translation is: "Russia and India, India and Russia, walk side by side, smiling and smiling. They have one inner feeling and one forward, upward and inward movement. To make the fastest progress, they are flying together in their oneness-heart-sky."</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Of course, there are no people who are more different than the Russians and the Indians.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> But in the depths of our heart we are all one. We have deepest appreciation and admiration for you and vice versa. Outwardly we may differ, but inwardly we always see eye to eye with each other because of our oneness.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Yes, yes!</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Very, very wonderful thought.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Would you permit my students to sing one more song in Bengali? It means, "My Lord Supreme, do not allow us to forget You."</p>
<p><em>(Singers perform "Bhulite diyona.")</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Lovely.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> May I offer this to you? These are the songs that I have composed for you.</p>
<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy presents the printed music to the songs.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> That's very kind. Really, you must have been up all night! I am very touched that you should have all come and sung for me and given me a part of your heart. I am very grateful.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Together we are trying to lift up the world with a oneness-heart. This is our "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart" Award. <em>(Gives medallion.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Thank you so much. I am very grateful. It's very, very sweet of you. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(A representative for the Singers presents Mr. Menuhin with a cake which has his portrait etched in icing.)</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> Oh no! You must take it and eat it.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> The portrait is on cardboard so you can save it.</p>
<p><em>Singer:</em> These are some recordings of Sri Chinmoy playing on the keyboard and other instruments. He plays many instruments, but he has a very unique and powerful keyboard style.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Menuhin:</em> That's very kind of you. <em>(To Sri Chinmoy)</em> Thank you. I'll never forget this. It's very sweet of you. After so many years, we have finally met.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Both inwardly and outwardly I feel our oneness-oneness in thought, oneness in action, oneness in selfless service to humanity.</p>
