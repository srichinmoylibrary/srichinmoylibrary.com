<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we attain the divine consciousness, it attains us and we also attain it. There is a meeting place where the two come together. Reality is all-pervading. Suppose right now we are on the first floor; this is our reality. God, who embodies the universal Consciousness, is on the third floor. So God comes down to the second floor with His Compassion and we go up to the second floor with our intense cry to attain oneness with His Consciousness. God embodies the highest divine Consciousness and He also embodies our inner cry. So God, who is within us in the form of our inner cry, carries us to the second floor; and God, who is outside us in the form of the infinite divine Consciousness, comes down to the second floor. God climbs up with us and God climbs down with the divine Consciousness. When both the seeker and God arrive at a particular place, the seeker enters into the divine Consciousness and the divine Consciousness enters into the seeker. With our personal effort and God’s Grace we go up and with His Compassion and Love God comes down.</p>

<h2>Question: How does one obtain purity?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is through our constant inner cry that we achieve purity and increase purity. When our inner cry climbs up, we gradually illumine our whole being, and when illumination takes place, all purity enters into us. There are a few spiritual exercises that help the seeker in acquiring purity. But the purity that lasts forever, the purity of the highest order, we get only from our inner cry for the highest Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The life of the lower vital has to be purified and illumined. But if we try to curb the demands of the lower vital all at once, this effort will be detrimental to our physical health. We have to transcend them slowly, steadily and unerringly. The higher spiritual life transcends the lower vital life. From the lower vital life, what we get is pleasure, whereas from the spiritual life, what we get is joy and delight. Pleasure and delight are two different things. Once we start getting divine ecstasy from our meditation, we will not feel the need for vital enjoyment. Slowly and steadily the seeker goes high, higher, highest. He transcends the needs of the physical when he feels that the life of the soul is fulfilling, illumining and immortalising.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The animal kingdom will not die out just because so many animals have evolved to a higher form of life. Similarly, when we all become divine beings in the course of spiritual evolution, human life will still go on; animal, plant and mineral life will still exist. Evolution starts right from the mineral world. As animals evolve into human beings, plants are evolving into animals and minerals are evolving into plants. In this way God’s creation is self-sustaining.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly! In this world it will take you twenty-two years only to get your Master’s degree, which is only finite earthly wisdom. In the spiritual life we are crying for something infinite — infinite Peace, infinite Light, infinite Knowledge, infinite Wisdom, infinite Bliss. Naturally, these attainments will take a much longer time. But if one gets a genuine spiritual Master, he can expedite his progress. If a student has to swim across the sea of ignorance all alone, it will take him a very, very long time. But if there is a Master with a boat, the student enters into the boat and then travels much faster to the other shore.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Karma Yoga is the Yoga of dedicated service. In the ordinary life, we have a motive when we work. There is always something we want to achieve. But if our only aim is to please God in His own way through our dedicated selfless service, if we do not care for anything else — not for name or fame or outer success — then this is real Karma Yoga.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The physical mind forgets, but the soul remembers. Anything that is worth having or worth remembering, the soul keeps. If we accept the spiritual life, it becomes easier for us to remember our past experiences. But even realised spiritual Masters remain ignorant for the first ten or eleven years after they reincarnate. But then, through prayer and meditation, they become conscious again of their past inner achievements and illumination.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How can one remain calm in the physical mind when one has so many things to do in so little time?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, if you are not peaceful, do you think that the things you have to accomplish will be accomplished sooner? No! When you are restless and agitated, when you are full of anxiety and worries, you just add to your problems and difficulties. Suppose you have a destination which you want to reach as soon as possible. If you carry inside you undivine elements like fear, doubt, anxiety, insecurity and so forth, that means you are carrying an extra weight and diminishing your capacity. So how will you reach your goal at the earliest possible hour? Your appointed hour will be delayed. A runner knows that if he carries extra weight, his opponents will defeat him. Now that you have accepted the spiritual life, you have to feel the necessity of emptying your mind all the time. When doubt, fear, insecurity or any other negative forces enter into your mind, just empty them out, cast them aside so that you can run the fastest. With inner faith, love, devotion and surrender you will run the fastest.</p>
<p>The first and foremost thing for a seeker is to have peace of mind. When you have established peace of mind, then you will see that the Hour of God will be accelerated and the things that you are trying to achieve and manifest on earth will be easily accomplished. The proper approach is to make the mind calm, quiet and tranquil always. When the mind is calm and tranquil, then you can run the fastest without carrying a heavy load.</p>
<p>While we are on earth we have to know that it is through constant aspiration that we can build a bridge between the finite and the Infinite. Then we shall carry the finite with us into the infinite and become one with the Infinite. Worries and anxieties will never help us. On the contrary, they will delay us. But if we have peace of mind, then we can run the fastest toward the goal and when the divine Hour strikes, we will be able to achieve what God wants us to achieve.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The soul knows that there is an eternal Time, and the soul is constantly growing, growing in the eternal Time. Unfortunately, when we remain in the physical mind or in the physical consciousness, it is simply impossible for us to think of something immortal or eternal. We limit ourselves to the earth-bound time. Earthbound time is broken up into fragments: one minute, two minutes, three minutes. But when we pray and meditate, we do not break up time in this way. Instead, at a glance we see the infinite and eternal Time, which is a smooth, unbroken flow; and we enter into eternal Time.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The seeker knows that he is a divine warrior fighting in the battlefield of life against ignorance darkness and bondage. Here on earth he may live for sixty, seventy or eighty years, and whatever he achieves will remain intact inside his inner being. But a warrior eventually needs rest; so at the end of his earthly journey, his soul goes back to the soul’s world to take rest for a few years. Then the same soul comes into the world once again with a new body, a new mind, a new heart. What for? To enter into the battle against ignorance once more and try to manifest the Supreme here on earth.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes I feel a sense of insecurity in my heart. Could you please tell me how I can overcome this feeling?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes I feel a sense of insecurity in my heart. Could you please tell me how I can overcome this feeling?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to hold God or if you try to grasp Him, then you are bound to be insecure. You have to know your proper relationship with God. You are God’s child; let us say, His chosen child. Suppose you and God are together at a particular place and right in front of you is a deep hole. If you are holding your Father’s hand, when temptation arises you may release your hold and try to grab that temptation. At that time, you will fall into the hole. But if you allow your eternal Father to hold you, then even if temptation assails you, He will hold you so tightly that you will not be able to fall into the abyss of ignorance.</p>
<p>Insecurity comes only because your heart knows that your grasp on God is weak, and when temptation comes you will release Him and fall. But if you feel that God is holding you, then you will not feel insecure because you know that God has infinite strength to hold you fast inside His Heart. Once God captures you, you can’t go away at all; and that is what you want. Since you have become spiritual, your goal is to be utilised by God according to His Will; you don’t want to utilise God at your sweet will. So you have to remain calm and quiet and let God capture and use you in His own way. God is utilising you; He is utilising you with His Illumination. If you want to use God for your own purpose, then temptation will come to you and ask you to utilise it. And when you try to utilise temptation, you will just be devoured by temptation.</p>
<p>From now on during your prayer and meditation, please try to offer yourself to God as His instrument, and do not try to get God as your instrument. When you make God your instrument, you will not know how to play correctly; today you will play God the instrument and tomorrow you will play ignorance the instrument. But if you are the instrument, then God will play perfectly in His own divine way. If you can make yourself a truly surrendered instrument, then there can be no insecurity in your heart.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is because man is more evolved than anything else on earth. When there is a good student, the teacher finds it easier to offer his wisdom to that student. In God’s classroom, the bad students will also one day become good. But meanwhile, the student who is advanced understands the wisdom and utilises more of the teacher’s light or knowledge than the backward student. God has created stones, animals, trees and everything else as well. But you can see that your development far exceeds that of a tree or an animal. The tree is also created by God, but your evolution is far more advanced. Whoever is more advanced will naturally have to take more responsibility in God’s manifestation.</p>
<p>In a family, the eldest member knows much more about the father than the youngest member knows. The father discusses family problems and the world-situation with the eldest son, not with his little children. But these children, the young ones, will also one day grow up and become mature. At that time, the father will discuss serious things with them, too.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want to realise God, if you want to manifest God, this earth is the only place it can be done. God-realisation and God-manifestation take place only on earth through human evolution. A God-realised man is the most highly evolved being in God’s creation. On other planets evolution does not take place.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He will tell the youngest son that he is not the Father, but he is on intimate terms with the Father. I always tell my disciples that the real Master, the real Guru, is God Himself, not any human being. But the spiritual Master is like the eldest member of the family. He knows all about the Father and he knows where the Father is. He tells the little ones that he can take them to the Father. Once he shows them where the Father is, then his business is over. Once the younger ones see the Father and see Him operating, then the rest of their progress is something between them and the Father.</p>
