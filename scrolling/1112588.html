<h2>Meditation in Zurich</h2>

<p>In Zurich over five hundred people came to the meditation. The seekers in Zurich were so good. They took prasad with real devotion — <em>devotion</em> is the right word. I am always deeply moved that when seekers in the audience in San Francisco take prasad after a public meditation, they show tremendous respect. Here in Zurich it was truly like our San Francisco experience. With such devotedness, hundreds of people took prasad.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Zatopek arrives</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Zatopek arrives" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>As you know, the immortal runner and Olympic gold medalist Emil Zatopek spent two days with us in Zurich on 14 and 15 June. Right from my childhood I have been a great admirer of his, so I am deeply grateful that Zatopek came from Czechoslovakia to visit us. So many unforgettable experiences we all had with him and his wife, Dana!</p>
<p>Our plane reached Zurich at eleven-thirty, and at twelve o'clock Zatopek's plane was supposed to arrive. Kailash, Abarita and I went with two photographers to another platform to wait for him. His plane came on time, but there was a problem with his bag. He had a small bag — you can call it a briefcase even — for his wife and himself. But they wouldn't allow him to carry the bag on the plane. It had to go in the baggage compartment. He said later that in America we can take big, huge boxes and all that, so he felt it was ridiculous that they wouldn't allow him to carry such a small bag.</p>
<p>We were watching him through the glass door as he was waiting by the carousel for his bag. Everybody's luggage came, but his was missing. He is my best friend in that way. So many times everybody's luggage comes except mine. Even returning to New York this time, I arrived yesterday and only today my luggage arrived. You can call my stories hilarious or painful.</p>
<p>We were all excited because we could see him, but he couldn't come outside to meet us because he was looking for his bag. At one point while we were waiting, ten or more middle-aged and elderly ladies asked me, "Is Zatopek here?" We pointed him out, "Yes, he is there." They had gotten their bags and everything, and, O God, now they wanted to see him. For about half an hour or more they were waiting outside — only to see Zatopek. They were so eager and anxious to meet him. Perhaps, for the first time, they were getting the opportunity to see him in person, When he was young, when he was a champion, they had heard his name. Now they wanted to see him.</p>
<p>At long last he came out and I approached him. He recognised me. I wanted to shake hands with him, but he immediately folded his hands in the Indian way and said, "Namaskar." Then he started talking to me in Hindi, using a few Hindi words. He was asking me if I wanted to drink hot tea. Then he asked, "How is it that Hindi is easy, but Urdu I could not learn?" He and his wife were in India for four months. We were talking and talking about various things,</p>
<p>A French disciple was using my movie camera, but there was nothing inside it — wonderful! But fortunately thirty or forty very nice pictures were taken by Marco. Then Zatopek and his wife went to their hotel to take rest.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The athletic meet</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The athletic meet" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>In two hours' time we met again at an athletic meet. A few world champions were there, and people had come from different countries. We were sitting together in the gallery with Zatopek and his wife. In the beginning he was so shy that his wife did most of the talking. It was not that Zatopek was snubbing me, but he would look to this side and that side and sometimes even close his eyes. His wife was absolutely at ease while we were chatting. Zatopek speaks many languages, but his wife seems to speak better English than he does.</p>
<p>During the five thousand-metre run, Zatopek picked a runner that he wanted to be first. He was telling me, "This runner is going to be first." It so happens that that particular runner had written me a letter about a year ago. He had heard about me and congratulated me on something that I had done. I forgot to tell Zatopek that it was the same person. Zatopek was clapping and screaming the runner's name, but that runner didn't come in first. Afterwards, the runner wanted to see me. I went and congratulated and consoled him.</p>
<p>When Zatopek went to give the prizes for the five thousand-metre race, the whole audience cheered him. Everybody in the stadium honoured him like anything.</p>

<p>Kailash was using my camera to take pictures at the athletic meet. It seemed that the camera was on exposure number eight, so Kailash took nine, ten and all the way up to thirty-six pictures. Then for some reason suspicion arose. He opened the camera and there was no film in it.</p>
<p>But there were three other photographers, so there was no problem. Marco and others were taking pictures; so it was not necessary for Kailash to take pictures also.</p>

<p>The funniest thing happened when it was time for the awards ceremony for the women's discus. For each event the organisers of the games had arranged for a "great man" to give out the prizes. They were looking for the great man who was supposed to give the prizes for the discus, but he was missing. Then it was discovered that this great man was none other than Abarita himself.</p>
<p>They called Abarita over the loud-speaker and begged him to give the prizes. Abarita dropped from Heaven! How could he go to the centre of the stadium and give the prizes? He knows nothing about the discus and he does not consider himself a great man. But those people were saying, "You are great."</p>
<p>In the ceremony there was a line of three or four girls, and the official had to put a medal around each girl's neck. The winners were all three and four times as large as Abarita; they were like Tejiyan and Bhima. They were absolutely from another world. Abarita became nervous, but since he had become the great man, he had to go and give out the prizes.</p>

<p>The girls in the four hundred-metre race ran so fast! You could barely see them even. It was very good and it reminded me of my races in India. They were all thin, like skeletons.</p>
<p>After the relay race, I was supposed to give out the prizes in the stadium and speak about Zatopek to honour him. I spoke for four or five minutes appreciating him, and I mentioned his wife's name also. Then Zatopek also spoke, thanking the organisers and encouraging us.</p>
<p>The German disciples sang "Run and Become" and the Marathon song very nicely.</p>

<p>Another calamity! Zatopek was supposed to get a very nice prize from the club and from us. But, God knows, there was some confusion and the prize we wanted to give him did not arrive in time.</p>
<p>All the disciples had was a very tiny-tinier than the tiniest-medallion. I said, "What am I going to do?" Abarita said, "What can you do? If you don't give a big prize, what will everyone think?" The disciples thought it would look odd for people to see such a tiny thing, so they wrapped a very big chocolate bar and put the medal on top.</p>
<p>But that night we compensated for this and gave Zatopek some very nice things that he liked — a very big cuckoo clock and other things. We told him afterwards that the other prize was all deception. But what could we do? Thousands of people were watching.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Zatopek and water</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Zatopek and water" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We were at the stadium for hours. There I usually drink tea and all that. I don't know how, but this time I became a good man and was drinking only water. Perhaps I didn't have the heart to ask the disciples to bring me tea. Three or four times I drank water. I was very thirsty and hot. Zatopek watched me — although at the time I didn't know that he was watching.</p>
<p>Zatopek likes drinking beer. When we went back to his hotel, there was a tiny refrigerator in each room. So he asked his wife to give him a beer. Then he changed his mind and said, "Oh, no, no! I saw Sri Chinmoy drinking water. After seeing him drink water, I can't drink beer." These were his words. So he asked his wife to give him water.</p>
<p>His wife was so happy to give him water, because she had been telling him for years that he should drink less beer. Then, to make her happier, he said, "Now, I am not going to drink beer anymore. Only on very rare occasions will I drink it. Otherwise, I will drink only water. I saw Sri Chinmoy drinking water; I can't drink beer anymore."</p>
<p>That night he didn't take beer and the following day also he didn't drink beer. He was drinking only water. So for two days he didn't drink beer. His wife was happy that he was fulfilling her wish.</p>

<p>In the running world, the Russians were Zatopek's worst enemies. Sometimes he used to break a world record and hold it only for a few days before the Russians would break it. The Russians tried in so many ways to defeat him. They used to give him bad advice. Outwardly they pretended to be very good friends, but often they told him everything wrong so that he would practice wrong and then lose. That kind of trick he didn't play on the Russians.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Stories from Zatopek</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Stories from Zatopek" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Zatopek told me so many stories, and I asked him many questions. He said that his father was so sad and mad when he took up running. His brother was also sad. He said, "You have cast a slur on our family. The neighbours have seen you running in another village. They are saying such bad things about us." He said that in his own village he didn't practise, because the people criticised him and hated him. So his father was very, very sad.</p>
<p>Then, when he became a champion, his father used to go to all the paper stands and collect the newspapers that had his picture. He kept album after album, only with Zatopek's pictures. When friends and relatives came, he would show them the albums, even before they asked anything about his son. Before that, his father was dead against his running. But when the neighbours started appreciating him, his father used to get much more joy from Zatopek's running than he himself got. This happened in my case also. When I used to stand first, my brother Mantu would get much more joy than I got.</p>
<p>When I asked Zatopek about his timing for one hundred, two hundred and four hundred metros, to verify what I had read in the book, he told me the timing. Believe it or not, my timing was better than his timing. But I didn't tell him that. Of course, I was a sprinter and Zatopek was a middle-distance and long-distance runner.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The television trick</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The television trick" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>One television station was supposed to interview both Zatopek and me. Then they changed their mind and said that they would interview only Zatopek. But Abarita said, "No. Zatopek came to Zurich at our request. If our Master cannot be there, then we will not allow Zatopek to be there." So Abarita cancelled it.</p>
<p>Then these rogues said, "We have changed our mind. Both of them should come." Around ten o'clock we went there and were taken to the main studio. In fifteen minutes' time we were supposed to be on television. A young girl came and put powder on Dana's face and on Zatopek's face. Then she went away. Immediately I got the point. I said, "They are playing a trick." So I stood up and asked Abarita, "Now, go and ask them if I will be in the interview. " Abarita asked them and they said, "No, we have changed our mind again. Only Zatopek and his wife will be there."</p>
<p>It was so hot there with all the studio lights. I started going into another room — but not actually outside the building — so I could watch the interview more comfortably on a television set. But then Abarita came up to me and said, "It will look very odd if you go away. No, please stay here."</p>
<p>I said, "I know, but it is so hot."</p>
<p>Then the interviewer came up to me and said, "We have a special place for you. Please come."</p>
<p>The special place was a seat with the jokers in the studio who only clap. There were about sixty or seventy who had come to watch the show. They put me in the front row. As soon as I joined them, they began cutting jokes and screaming and doing all kinds of things. Fortunately, I didn't understand their language. They were behaving as if they had come directly from a zoo; they were mocking and all that — the way you see them behave on television. While Zatopek and his wife were being interviewed, they showed pictures of his Helsinki performance. At one point, Zatopek broke in and started talking about me. The interviewer immediately changed the subject. But when Zatopek mentioned my name, for two seconds the camera turned towards me and I was on television. So people saw me for two seconds. The rest of the time it was all about Zatopek. They did not allow him even to talk about me.</p>
<p>When it was all over, immediately Zatopek grabbed me. He felt very sad. With a very sorrowful face he said, "You are a very, very great, creative personality." I said, "What can you do? It is not your fault. Everything is for the best."</p>

<p>Later we went to our dining place and I played for ten or fifteen minutes on the esraj. Both Zatopek and his wife were listening very attentively. In a book about him, I had read that he used to play on the guitar, so we asked him to play for us. He took the guitar and for two or three seconds he played. Then he gave it to his wife, saying, "She is the one who plays."</p>
<p>She took the guitar and played. Then we asked them to sing one or two songs; but to our delight, they sang one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. They went on and on. I must say, they and I have some similarities. When you ask me to sing, I don't stop. They said, "We don't sing spiritual songs. We sing folk songs." So they sang many songs in different languages. I have a tape of them. It is very nice. Both of them have excellent singing voices. He sang while she was playing on the guitar. Then, at one point, we again asked him to play. He didn't want to. He said, "No, as you are their Guru, she is my Guru." He used the term "Guru" quite a few times.</p>

<p>When we showed the movie we had made for them of the singers in New York performing the songs I had dedicated to Zatopek, he and his wife were sitting literally on the edge of their seats. Pictures are there to prove it. They wouldn't look to this side or that side. During the serious songs I could understand it. But even during the joking sections they were sitting like that. In the movie at times our people joke and perform short skits to illustrate the songs; everything is going on. But even then Zatopek and his wife didn't laugh. Usually they are not so serious. They smile and joke and do all kinds of things. But during the movie they were so moved. They watched in pin-drop silence, as if they were glued to the screen.</p>

<p>After the movie I presented Zatopek with the book I had written about him. It seems that Zatopek does not like to read anything. Perhaps he thinks it is a waste of time. I do not blame him. His wife reads on his behalf. He turns the pages, but he doesn't read. But his wife reads everything carefully. She will read my book and tell him about it. He liked very much the songs and also the movie we made for him.</p>
