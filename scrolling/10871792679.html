<p>Recently I went to a store in Queens. The owner, who is an Indian, said, "I saw you playing music in Vancouver at the end of last year."</p>
<p>I was wearing my track suit, so I said, "Now I am in this uniform."</p>
<p>He said, "No matter what you wear, you have a Heavenly majesty."</p>

<p>On our Christmas trip in South America, people often recognised me on the street. In one store, the owner said, "My friend, I saw you on television." But his wife didn't believe that I was his friend.</p>
<p>On another occasion, I went looking for flutes with Saraswati. She went into one shop and when she came back to the car, a young girl came running out of the shop just to see me.</p>
<p>But at an Indian store here in Jamaica, the saleslady did not know me at all. When I went inside, she asked me, "Are you with the Hare Krishna movement?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I have my own."</p>
<p>She said, "You?"</p>
<p>I told her my name but she had not heard it before. She said, "Oh no, I know only about Hare Krishna."</p>
<p>The store was right here in Jamaica, and she did not know me! Databir was one hundred per cent sure that he had a brochure about me in his car, but he could not find it. So what could I do?</p>

<p>Many years ago in Puerto Rico, I was looking at Bhakti Vedanta's picture on the wall of his students' restaurant. God knows why, but I had to tell the lady at the register that I knew him well.</p>
<p>She said, "You are so blessed." Then she called over the other workers and said, "He saw our Master. He is so blessed."</p>
<p>Bhakti Vedanta used to come to the Indian Consulate when I was working there.</p>

<p>When I was in St. Louis, I wanted to get Nilima a present because she did not come on the trip. I saw two fish, but one was black, so I took only the other one to the counter.</p>
<p>The man said to me, "They are a set. You have to buy both of them."</p>
<p>I said, "No, I don't want the other one because it is black."</p>
<p>The man said, "They are salt and pepper shakers. You don't want to use both salt and pepper?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, I'm not going to use it for that."</p>
<p>He asked, "What will you use it for?"</p>
<p>I told him, "I am going to use it as an incense burner."</p>
<p>The man said, "You will have to pay the full price even if you only take one."</p>
<p>So I said I would pay. But when I took out my money, he said, "All right, I'll charge you only for one."</p>

<p>Two days ago I went to buy some birds at a pet store in Queens. A few years ago I used to go to that store very often, but I have not been there recently.</p>
<p>While I was looking at two birds, Databir told the owner about my 7,000-pound one-arm lift and gave the man a poster.</p>
<p>Finally, I bought the two birds. When I came up to the man to pay, he said, "You look 20 years younger than when I last saw you. Now you are so strong!"</p>

<p>In Japan, Maral told me that he had found an instrument that he thought I might like. He said, "Guru, it is very expensive, but if you like it, I will buy it for you." But I didn't like the instrument, so I told him not to buy it.</p>
<p>The store also had some Western flutes. I said, "I would like to buy one," but the man wouldn't allow me to try the flutes because they were too expensive.</p>
<p>I said, "Without examining the flute or playing it, how can I buy it?"</p>
<p>The man said, "No, good musicians don't need to play the flutes. I won't allow it."</p>
<p>We had pamphlets that said I play the flute at my concerts, but the man couldn't read English. So we went to another store and found a Yamaha keyboard. I said, "Maral, just buy it."</p>
<p>Then I left the place and Maral bought it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to a store that sells medallions and trophies. This was my second visit there. The owner knows all about us because we always buy prizes for our marathons from him. His name is Joe.</p>
<p>I bought seven or eight trophies and some small medallions. I also bought a trophy for Databir because he had stood first in our tennis competition.</p>
<p>The bill came to $45. I said, "How can it be so low? I could never buy so many things from any other store for this price!"</p>
<p>Joe said, "It is because I have a soft heart for Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>I said, "All right, your soft heart has touched my soft heart." So instead of $45, I gave him $70, since 7 is one of my lucky numbers.</p>
<p>The man wanted to know how I could jump from $45 to $70, but I forced him to take the $70. Then he told me that since he is Catholic, one of the disciples had promised to give him a picture of me with the Pope. I said, "I will make sure that he keeps his promise."</p>
<p>See how two persons can be nice!</p>

<p>I often go to a bookstore across from the Jamaica Savings Bank. The owner has known me for a long time, but to him I was just a customer. He had never been particularly interested in me.</p>
<p>Today when I went there, right on the front of his desk I saw <em>Beyond Within</em> and <em>Eastern Light for the Western Mind</em>.</p>
<p>I said, "These are my books."</p>
<p>He said, "Heh!"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He asked, "You are the author?"</p>
<p>I was wearing shorts and he was looking at me as though he didn't believe me.Then he started asking me questions, and we talked for ten minutes.</p>
<p>I told him I wanted a daily prayer book. He found one and gave it to me. He said, "I will give you a little discount. I will sell it to you for eleven dollars."</p>
<p>So I took out a ten-dollar bill and a single, but he gave me the one back and said, "Please come back again and again. I like to talk to you!."I have been there so many times, but this is the first time that this has happened.</p>

<p>I went shopping with Databir today at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. When I used to work at the Indian Consulate, every day I would go to a small post office in Bloomingdale's to mail passports for the Consulate. There was a black man who worked there, and each time he saw me he used to beg me to come to his church and listen to the sermon of his minister. He was very nice to me, but unfortunately I never went to his church.</p>

<p>I went into a bookstore that sold many spiritual books. I was very happy to see some books written by friends of mine in India, so I got four or five books.</p>
<p>At the counter I appreciated the bookstore like anything. Then I had to become another George Bernard Shaw: I had to ask if they had any books by Sri Chinmoy.</p>
<p>The man at the counter said, "Yes, there are many books by Sri Chinmoy." Then he took me to one of the shelves, but none of my books were there. He said, "Definitely they were there."</p>
<p>He said they sell my books, but that they were out of stock. He told me they get my books from India.</p>
<p>Then I introduced myself and said, "You don't get them from India. Our Aum Publications sells them."</p>
<p>They were so moved to meet me and asked for my autograph.</p>
