  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when I approach you in person or when I try to approach you in meditation, I remember that you have said that inside gratitude everything is present.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when I approach you in person or when I try to approach you in meditation, I remember that you have said that inside gratitude everything is present." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely!</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> I feel that I need to go towards sincerity before I can have any gratitude. I feel that if I admit I do not have this spontaneous feeling of gratitude, then I am being sincere. If I feel gratitude only on the surface, I think that it is not real.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is real. Indians say that by doing japa they will realise God. In the morning, you may say "Guru" or "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme, Supreme." If you say "Supreme" four or five thousand times, perhaps the very first time your "Supreme" will not be coming from the very depths of your heart. It may happen that sincerity does not come at first. When you try to run your fastest in the 100-metre sprint, if you do not jog first, if you do not warm up, if you do not stretch your legs, can you run the fastest? No, you cannot. You need preparation.</p>
<p>I say inside gratitude, everything can be found, true. If you develop gratitude, inside that gratitude everything is found. But other divine qualities, like simplicity, must be there also. The mind has to be very simple, the heart has to be pure, and the whole life has to be childlike. These are like the stretching exercises. If you do not do the stretching exercises, if you do not jog, how will you run the fastest?</p>
<p>You are saying that if there is no sincerity, then gratitude is of no avail. What is the good of gratitude if it is not sincere? But I say that to get sincerity, you have to do a few preparatory things. You have to start with spiritual exercises, like japa. You say, "Supreme, Supreme, Supreme" or do other spiritual activities, and that is your stretching, that is your jogging. Then, after a few minutes, your goal is to run the fastest. At that time gratitude will come like the fastest sprinter.</p>
<p>Again, in the beginning you have to do japa or other spiritual exercises, like singing some spiritual songs. If you sing a few soulful songs, these are your stretching exercises. If you sing "Tomare Rakhibo", "Jiban Debata", "Bhulite Diyona" or other favourite songs, that will help you to bring forward your most sincere gratitude. Always in order to reach the highest, to do our best, we need something to prepare ourselves. Even in a car, if you put your foot on the gas pedal and immediately try to go sixty or seventy miles an hour, the car may be damaged and you may be injured.</p>
<p>Gratitude has to come little by little. It does not come all at once. Gradually, gradually some sprinters are able to take very little time to reach their fastest speed, while others take a long, long time. By practising and practising, if once you took, say, fifteen or twenty minutes to bring forward your utmost gratitude, gradually you can bring it down to five minutes or even three minutes.</p>
<p>Is it clear? These are cute questions, very nice questions!</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have been reading about different spiritual Masters who you have said have realised God.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have been reading about different spiritual Masters who you have said have realised God." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is good to read writings about spiritual Masters, or by spiritual Masters, if it increases your devotion to your own Master. In my childhood and in my adolescent years, when I used to read Sri Ramakrishna's sayings, or read about Sri Ramakrishna, it immensely increased my love for my Master, Sri Aurobindo. When I used to read the writings of Sri Ramakrishna's disciples, or books about Sri Ramakrishna showing his love for Mother Kali, that helped me so much to increase my devotion for Sri Aurobindo and the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>When you are reading spiritual books written by other Masters or about other Masters, you have to know that the main purpose of your reading is to help you increase your devotion to your path, to your Master. But if you enter into comparison and say, "Oh no, my Master is better and his Master is worse," or "His path is better, mine is worse," or, "This Master is saying something better than my Master," or, "This Master is nothing — my Master is better, my Master is higher," then problems start. Many people get confused when they enter into the world of comparison. No comparison, no comparison!</p>
<p>If you want to read about other Masters at all, it is good sometimes to read when your aspiration is a little bit dry, when you are not getting immediate inspiration. By reading this book or that book if you want to increase your aspiration-intensity, it will be of help.</p>
<p>But once your aspiration is very, very intense, for some weeks or months, at that time you should not read books about other Masters, because already you are going at top speed. At that time you do not need to read about other Masters. If you feel that you are making the fastest progress in your own inner life, at that time it is not at all advisable to read about other Masters. Your train is going at top speed. Only you have to feel that your Master is carrying you, or you are carrying your Master.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can you give another method for stopping empty moments? In Everest-Aspiration you wrote, &quot;You are saying that you suffer from empty moments. Do you know why?&quot; Your answer was, &quot;you are not playing inside the garden of your heart with your heart&#039;s child, the soul.&quot; Can you give me an additional method for stopping empty moments when they occur?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can you give another method for stopping empty moments? In &lt;em&gt;Everest-Aspiration&lt;/em&gt; you wrote, &amp;quot;You are saying that you suffer from empty moments. Do you know why?&amp;quot; Your answer was, &amp;quot;you are not playing inside the garden of your heart with your heart&#039;s child, the soul.&amp;quot; Can you give me an additional method for stopping empty moments when they occur?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have emptiness, you can easily be fooled by your mind. When you feel empty, totally empty, at that time you do not know whether this emptiness is good for you or not. It can be the emptiness of a vessel, after you have emptied it. Then my grace, my divinity will enter into you. Sometimes this kind of emptiness is absolutely necessary. The mind is discouraging you by saying you are empty, empty; there is nothing in life — it is absolutely useless, hopeless. When the mind says that kind of thing, the mind is fooling you.</p>
<p>At times it may be that emptiness is preparatory. Emptiness is preparing you for the descent of something higher, something extremely important. The mind may tell you that life is a hopeless case; now you have gone down, you have fallen, and there is nothing. It may tell you that you are not getting any joy from your spiritual life, from your meditation.</p>
<p>But the mind can fool you. At that time you can easily tell your mind, "No, this emptiness is good." It will last perhaps only for a few hours, a few days or a few weeks. Change your mind: think that the emptiness is good for you, that you are preparing yourself. But if you feel lost, that is not good.</p>
<p>Always when anything discouraging takes place, you have to be clever. You have to be wise. That discouragement has to be counteracted. You have to fight against the discouragement by any means. If you feel empty, say to your mind, "No, this is necessary for me. Something within me is about to receive. Inside me something is happening, and I am not yet aware of it." Your mind may say, "Absolutely I am empty, empty, empty. There is nothing inside me. It is a barren desert." But the heart can say, "No, this is a special time. The farmer, my spiritual Master, is digging and ploughing the field." Try to feel that your Master is ploughing the field in your heart. Then he will sow the seed, and soon you will get a bumper crop. You are not fooling yourself — it is true!</p>
<p>These are the ways, the divine ways, to contradict and conquer the wrong forces that attack you. These are the absolutely positive ways to conquer wrong forces. Nothing should discourage you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes when I read writings by other Masters, I wonder — if two or three God-realised Masters are living at the same time, why do they not know about each other? Is the Supreme aware of them in His own Being in and through each of them? Are they like one person?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes when I read writings by other Masters, I wonder — if two or three God-realised Masters are living at the same time, why do they not know about each other? Is the Supreme aware of them in His own Being in and through each of them? Are they like one person?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It may happen that the Supreme does not want them to know about each other. He wants all of us — not only spiritual Masters — to know only whatever is going to encourage us, inspire us. Anything that is illumining and fulfilling, anything that is necessary, the Supreme will tell us. Even in one human life there are many, many things the Supreme wants us to forget. Many, many things He definitely wants us to forget! Again, many, many things he wants us to remember in our own life.</p>
<p>Usually the Supreme says that we do not have to know what others are doing. The Supreme is being manifested in and through others, true; but I do not have to deal with their lives. I am in my boat, my own boat. My boat is enough for me. The Supreme says, "Be with the passengers that I have given you. Why do you have to know about another spiritual Master and what he is doing?" The Father has said to one son, "Take this boat and gather some passengers and come to Me." To another one He will say, "Take that boat." But if I start wondering about the other boatman, how he is piloting the boat, this and that, then I will get lost. Even while driving, two persons may be going in the same direction, but can one person go on looking to the left or to the right? His speed will disappear and he may have a collision. This is what will happen.</p>
<p>Basically, when two persons are realised, they have to know about each other. They do know what is happening, but the Supreme says, "You have enough problems with your life, with your spiritual children. You have enough, enough, enough problems!"</p>
<p>Again, different spiritual Masters can be God-realised, but their heights may differ. Some spiritual Masters have just reached the tree with difficulty. They have come and just touched the God-realisation-tree. They are claiming God-realisation, and for them there will be many, many disciples. Some Masters have reached the middle of the tree, and some are higher. Some will climb up the tree and then fly away. They have gone beyond the tree, this so-called God-realisation-tree. They have gone high, higher, highest, singing the song of transcendence.</p>
<p>Now, what benefit do I get by seeing what another Master is doing? Whether the other Master is at the foot of the tree or in the middle, I do not get anything. If God wants me to go and see him, then I will go. Definitely I will come down or go up to see another Master. But usually God does not want me to do that. God says, "You do your own job. I have given you a task, a supreme task. You fulfil it in and through your chosen disciples." That is all. Otherwise, why did God not choose just one spiritual Master right from the beginning? God is Immortal, God is Infinite. Whatever spiritual Master you name — whether it is Sri Krishna or Lord Buddha or the Saviour Christ — God easily could have kept that Master on the physical plane throughout Eternity. But He did not want to do that. He always wants somebody else, somebody else, somebody else.</p>
<p>Again, the essence God keeps the same. The Highest He will give to Sri Krishna, He will give to Jesus Christ, to the Lord Buddha and to others. But to know what others are doing is nothing but a waste of time.</p>
<p>If I as your spiritual Master can make you or any individual perfect, any instrument perfect, God will be so proud of me and so proud of that individual. God will never be proud of me if I use occult power right now and go inwardly to another country to see out of curiosity what the President is doing or what some other important figure is doing, or what another spiritual Master is doing there. God will say, "Do I want you to use your magic-power, or do I want you to use your heart-power to elevate humanity?"</p>
<p>Magic-power, occult power, we can acquire, but magic-power is not going to elevate anyone's life. In India some miracle-men have shown magic-power. I shall give you an example. A couple became disciples of a miracle-man, and they had a child. From the very birth of that child, the Master was so affectionate, so indulgent. He took full responsibility for the child's kindergarten, primary school, high school and college life. The child became dearer than the dearest to the Master. Eventually that fellow got married and had a child of his own. He was very, very close to the Master, and he saw all his Master's miracles, perhaps more than anybody else. His was absolutely the dearest family.</p>
<p>Then what happened? Insecurity started; jealousy started. Somebody else was becoming close to the Master. One day that fellow, absolutely the dearest one, came with a stick to beat up the Master. Then he came with another weapon. All the Master's problems started with the dearer than the dearest one. His dearest disciple was the culprit, because somebody else was becoming close to the Master. Whose life did the Master change by showing miracles?</p>
<p>The Saviour Christ showed the world forty-five or forty-six miracles, but it is not because of his miracle-power that today the world is worshipping him. Because of his oneness with his Father, the Christ said, "I and my Father are one," and "Let Thy Will be done." It is for these messages that people worship the Christ. No outer miracle can elevate anybody's consciousness. It is like fireworks that go up and then disappear.</p>
<p>Again, there are times when occult powers are used for a right cause. When God wants somebody to remain on earth, and some hostile forces have attacked, I shall use occult power. If it is God's intention to keep that person on earth, if God wants to grant an extension, then I shall use occult power to save the person. But to use occult power to know what is inside another person's mind, or who is a spiritual Master, is not only a waste of time; it is discouraging. Why do we have to get this kind of world-information? We are not looking for world-information. We are looking for world-illumination and world-transformation.</p>
<p>Knowing what another spiritual Master is doing, whether he is eating or cutting jokes with his disciples or playing tennis-will that help me? Only one thing will help, and that is to know that he is for God, like me. He has his own spiritual family. He is also trying to please God by transforming the nature of his disciples. He is trying to take a few disciples to God. It is more than enough for me to know that he is doing the same thing as I am doing. I am doing it for my disciples, my spiritual children, and he is doing it for his spiritual children. More than that is absolutely unnecessary; it is only collecting world-information.</p>
<p>Sometimes when we feed our curiosity, it give us tremendous joy. From curiosity, on very rare occasions, comes real spirituality, real sincerity. We had a disciple many years ago, when our meetings were in Manhattan, who was very promising. When she came to the meetings, she used to shed tears. We gave a rose to each seeker in those days. Then this particular seeker got a boyfriend, and they went to another spiritual Master's place. This seeker was really doing good meditations. The other Master told her, "I see that behind you Sri Chinmoy is standing." That Master gave a full description of me. I have done similar things with my disciples.</p>
<p>This seeker was so moved. Then what happened? Before she left to see the other Master, she had been on our path for six or eight months. She was so moved that the other Master could tell who her spiritual Master was. But when she came back, she did not come to our meetings more than two or three times. How did it help for her to know that another Master could see that I was her Master? Suppose she thought, "O my God, she is a spiritual Master! She knows about my Master and she was speaking highly, very highly of my Master." Still, nothing happened. The seeker was enjoying her vital life, so she had to leave. If she had been a sincere seeker, that experience would have increased her love for me and her devotion to me. Then she would have come back to our path and become strict. But that did not happen. What can you do?</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That joking is infinitely better than brooding and sulking and speaking ill of others — infinitely better! You are lightening yourself when you joke, when you enjoy the humour aspect. Is there anybody among the spiritual Masters who did not like jokes? Sri Aurobindo enjoyed humour very much. So did Sri Ramakrishna. All the spiritual Masters enjoyed humour.</p>
<p>Humour takes away the mental fever, not only the physical fever. To take away the fever that we have inside the mind, humour is the best medicine.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it all right to be that way all day long?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it all right to be that way all day long?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not all day long! The time comes when you must be serious. But why do I allow these things here? These funny things are lightening your mind. The whole day you work very hard for your livelihood. That work puts such a heavy load on the mind.</p>
<p>Even if you see a person — it does not have to be someone at your work — it can affect you. You go out in the street, you see an individual, and that person has so many problems. You are not talking to that person, but his problems are entering into you. You do not know why your mind has become so heavy, heavy, heavy. That heaviness has come from the person whom you saw for a fleeting second. Then it takes time, so much time, for you to unburden yourself. You do not know what has actually entered into you, but you feel something heavy — a very, very heavy load. By looking at a person even unconsciously, not to appreciate something in him, you are being attacked, attacked.</p>
<p>Again, humour takes away that heaviness of the mind. Then after a few minutes, perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes, the time comes when you feel that the mind is light, the mind has become serious and sincere, the mind is searching, not doubting. You have to know at what point the mind is searching for truth, and at what point the mind is doubting your spirituality, doubting someone or doing other negative things. When the time comes that you feel the mind is searching for light, for truth, that is the time you are ready to meditate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, I sometimes find myself preoccupied with the frustrations of my past and my insecurities about the future. How can I conquer my attachment to time?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> , </sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, I sometimes find myself preoccupied with the frustrations of my past and my insecurities about the future. How can I conquer my attachment to time?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Good boy, you know that the past is dust — the past that drags us back. We think, "I did this wrong; you did that wrong; I did this wrong." By thinking of the past, we are not going ahead. The past is like a chain pulling us back. We want to go forward, but the chain is so powerful that it is bringing us back.</p>
<p>Again, the future is also something never to be thought of. The present is the only thing that we should care for. If we think of the future, including our future worries and anxieties, we cannot go forward. The future is all uncertainty, uncertainty. Even the Highest Himself changes His Opinion. Today the Highest says, "The future will be like this." The next moment, to our greatest surprise, the Highest can change His Plan.</p>
<p>It is like football, or what you call soccer. When you play soccer, you are sure that another player is going to score with his right leg. Alas, at the last moment he uses his left leg. Or you are sure that he is going to try to score, but he passes the ball on to somebody else. That person is coming towards you, and he is trying to score. You think that he is going to use his right leg, but he uses his left leg. Then you think that he is definitely going to try to score. No, he passes the ball on to somebody else. This is what happens in our day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Again, ultimately we know that our team will score. Either you will score or your brother will score or somebody else will score; that we know. The ultimate conclusion of the Cosmic Game we know. The ultimate conclusion is the Victory of the Divine. You have been watching the Mahabharata videos on television. How the good people, the Pandavas, are suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering! Is there any comparison between the Pandavas and the Kauravas? The Pandavas are suffering, suffering and suffering, but Sri Krishna is always there for them. This is the Cosmic Game. Sri Krishna goes on, suffering inside the Pandavas, with the Pandavas. Then what happens? He knows that ultimately the Pandavas will win. Sri Krishna is God Himself, but he has to leave his place with all his people and establish a kingdom somewhere else. It is all part of the Cosmic Plan. When the time comes, he wins the divine Victory.</p>
<p>Let us not think of the future. The more we think of the future, the more confusion we create. And if we think of the past, we will see that the past only knows how to pull us back, pull us back, pull us back immediately. Then we go back to the beginning and again we have to start our journey. The moment we think of the past, a very powerful chain is dragging us back. And when we think of the future, it is all uncertain. True, it is certain in the sense that we know the divine Victory is the ultimate conclusion. But in the meantime, if we want to see the light in a particular way, even if we are sure that the light is at a particular place, we will find that the light is not there; it is somewhere else.</p>
<p>Always there are times when we do not expect the game to proceed in a certain way. Let us think of our Sunil.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In his case, he lived five years more than he was fated to live. But how do we know that Sunil did not have a strong desire to climb the Himalayas one day? How do we know that he did not want to swim the English Channel once more? Now look at his future. He imagined a rosy future. He thought, "I will do this, I will do that, I will improve my health." He had already climbed so many mountains, and he was hoping that one day he would climb the Himalayas. He hoped that once more he would swim the English Channel. If we think of the future, it is all hope.</p>
<p>Somebody is studying in high school. He thinks that he will graduate, then he will get a Bachelor's degree, then a Master's degree. He is planning. Planning is not bad, but if he thinks only of the future, he is wasting time. If he is studying at the high school level, he should think of the immediate next step, college nothing more. He should think of only one step. And again, if he is really wise, he will think only of his present studies. He has not to think of college at all. Now he has to complete high school. If he is completing his high school course, then let him only think of that. Otherwise, he is dealing with uncertainty. The goal is there, but the road is not straight; it is zigzag, always zigzag.</p>
<p>We say there is a golden road, but that is only if one has tremendous aspiration, a most intense inner cry, twenty-four hours a day. How many people can have a twenty-four-hour-a-day inner cry? Yes, there is a shortcut: the golden road. But we may not be aware of that golden road. Or we may know it is there, but how will we get there? With constant prayer and constant meditation we can arrive at that golden road. Otherwise, the road is like a snake. This serpentine road goes on and on.</p>
<p>Worrying either about the past, about what we have already done, or about what is going to happen in the future, does not help. What we need is light, more light, abundant light. Then we have to know that we should never try to fight against darkness. Darkness has to be illumined. Some countries are fighting, fighting, fighting, but where is satisfaction? If we want to have joy, "tit for tat" does not work—never! We cannot fight against darkness. Yes, we can fight, but darkness will also fight against us.</p>
<p>Light does not fight. Light only illumines. For us, light is here, in the present. The light that the present gives us, or the light that we have in the present, that light we have to increase. By increasing the light, we shall try to illumine the uncertain future, where we are imagining what is going to happen. If we can illumine the future, it does not remain the future; it becomes today. It becomes now. If we have the light, that light will show if there is any danger ten steps ahead or if the road is clear. But if we do not have the light, then the next step we do not know. To see the future, we have to increase our inner light.</p>
<p>The more we have inner light, the farther we can see. At that time we can call it the future, or we can say that the reality ahead of us has come into our today's life. The reality is in the future, but with our light we are not seeing it there. We no longer see it at a distance. At that time we feel that it is within our easy reach, or it is inside us.</p>
<p>My advice to all of you, my spiritual children, is always to see the light inside you. That light will always see what has to be seen. If you are worrying, do not worry. If you are thinking that the past is discouraging, do not think of the past. At every moment we have to illumine ourselves and also forgive ourselves. God will forgive us, true. God does forgive us, but we do not forgive ourselves. We think about the past: "I did this wrong thing, I did that wrong thing." If we pray to God, God will forgive us. But we do not forget what we have done wrong — no! And sometimes it happens that even when God has definitely forgiven us, we think that God has <em>not</em> forgiven us.</p>
<p>If we cannot forgive ourselves, if we always think of what we have done wrong, then when God forgives us, His Forgiveness itself does not last. God's Forgiveness is there for us, and God knows that He has forgiven us. But we always think, "O my God, how can He forget what I did? How can He forgive me? How can He forgive me for this?"</p>
<p>Forget about the past! True, many good things also happened in the past, but while you are trying to bring forward the good things, the devouring tiger grabs you and grabs those good things as well. Let us say that when you were five or six years old, you did something very, very good, or something very good happened in your life. Right now, to try to bring those good memories forward is a waste of time, because you have so many problems at this stage. What will you do? What shall we all do? We shall increase and increase our light, and then there shall come a time when all the good things from the past we shall be able to bring forward safely.</p>
<p>I always say that today's problems are enough to make us unhappy. Why do we have to think of yesterday's problems, or tomorrow's problems? Do we think today's problems are not enough? For each individual, today is enough! This moment is enough for us. If we depend on God's Will, if we pray and meditate, then this moment we are safe. The next moment again we can pray and meditate and please God in His own Way through our devoted selfless service, and then again we shall be safe.</p>
<p>I tell you, the service that some of you are rendering to me is in no way inferior to meditation. To some extent it is even better, because while you are serving the Supreme in me, in your Master, you are fully alert. Some of you are doing electrical work. If you are not alert, you may get a shock and go to Heaven. I do not want you to go to Heaven in that way! While you are meditating, you may at times vegetate. You may look at my Transcendental Photograph, meditate for five minutes and then fall asleep. While you are working with an electrical current, can you fall asleep? In many cases, your devoted service is infinitely more effective than meditation. You are working intensely. You are not allowing any thoughts to enter your mind. Afterwards you can rest for five minutes, but while working you cannot take rest. If you stop for half an hour or an hour, you will be delaying your important work. And if your concentration is missing, you may be injured.</p>
<p>If you do not meditate well, even if you fall asleep, you are not losing anything; it is only that your realisation will take place perhaps two days later. But when you are working with such intensity, you are not making any mistake and you are not getting any kind of injury, so you can see how intensely you are concentrating.</p>
<p>Concentration is so important in life. If you concentrate, then a wrong force cannot come to you. If you concentrate, then a good thought comes. I am saying, and other spiritual Masters have also said, that devoted service is extremely important. While serving, you cannot think wrong thoughts, you cannot look around. Serious, serious tasks you are performing. If you are breaking down a wall or building something, you may meet with danger at any moment. But if you try to meditate and then you fall asleep, is there any danger? Only if you are very sincere and intense in your meditation, then you are making very fast progress.</p>
<p>Even if you make the fastest progress in your meditation, the road of devoted service is easier. And if you want to do something for humanity, then you have to offer service. As a seeker, you are looking towards your own realisation. But if you do selfless service, any kind of service, then you are doing it for mankind; whereas if you pray and meditate, you may be doing it only for yourself. Again, while praying and meditating, you can say, "I am offering the results of my meditation to humanity."</p>
<p>On the practical level, selfless service, devoted service, is so important. While you are doing physical work, at that very moment your concentration is so powerful. If anything goes wrong, the house you are working on may collapse or catch fire. But if you do not meditate sincerely or devotedly, the house remains the same; only your inner progress is delayed. Look at the difference!</p>
<p>I am coming back to your question. Right now do not think of the past. Many good things happened in the past, in addition to the bad things. But right now if you want to bring them to the fore, you will be in difficulty because of all the mistakes that were committed. Those bad things, try to devour; or let those bad dogs sleep. When the time comes, the good experiences will come forward like deer. We shall beckon the deer, and the deer will come to us with all the good things that we have done.</p>
<p>And never think of the future! Think only of today. Even in the next hour, what is going to happen, God alone knows. We cannot see the future. Some good ideas about the future may come and lift you up, but some wrong ideas can also come and devour you. This second is enough for you to become a good person. This very second you have to strive to become a good person. If you think of the next two hours, on the strength of your imagination you can do it. But in two hours so many things can happen! Accidents are taking place in the twinkling of an eye. You are going to Manhattan, and you are sure that in half an hour you will get there. Then an accident takes place, and alas, there is a traffic jam. You will see that your thinking has nothing to do with reality.</p>
<p>The divine approach is to say, "The reality of today, the reality of this moment, is enough for me. At this moment I am going through so many inner crises and outer obstacles. Outer obstacles and inner crises have captured this moment, so I have to disentangle them." Never think even of the good things from the past. There are millions of good things, but never think of them — no! If you have a hundred dollars of spiritual wealth, just make sure that you deposit it in the safe. By becoming a good person at this very moment, you are adding one more dollar to that amount in the safe. Always add, add, add, and never think of tomorrow.</p>
<p>People who think of tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next month will not have enough faith in God. People who have abundant faith, boundless faith in God will say, "God took care of me up to this day, and again God will take care of me tomorrow. My job is to pray for God's Victory. My job is to pray for God's Protection." If we love God, He will mould us and shape us in His own Way. Your faith in God will determine your life, whether present or past or future. If you have faith in God, He will take care of this moment, He will take care of the next moment, He will take care of all the subsequent moments. Only remain good for this very moment, for this hour, for today. And when tomorrow comes, again do the same thing.</p>
<p>Do not think of tomorrow, what you are going to become or what tomorrow will give you. Do the needful today. Tomorrow will come automatically, and again tomorrow you will do the same thing. Then, the day after tomorrow will automatically come. Do not think of tomorrow and how you will behave tomorrow. Today if you are behaving well, that is enough for today. The same inner joy and strength that you got by becoming a good person today, you will again get tomorrow. But do not bring tomorrow into today. Tomorrow is all ready to come to you. Tomorrow is knocking, knocking, knocking at your door, only you are not ready to open the door. Your friend or enemy — tomorrow — is knocking and knocking, but you are not ready, you are not ready. When you are ready, then you will open the door. Then you will see that your friend has come.</p>
<p>Do not think of the past, do not think of the future; only think of the present. And the present has to be full of determination and full of faith — faith not only in God, but also in yourself. If we do not have faith in ourselves, no matter how much faith God has in us, it will not operate. If we have faith in ourselves, God gives us more and more and more faith. People always say, "I do not have faith in myself. O God, You give me faith." But God will say, "If you do not have faith in yourself, then where is your vessel? Where shall I put My Blessing? I am ready to give you My Blessing, but you do not have a vessel." To have faith in oneself is to have a container where God can pour His Light and His Bliss. If we do not have faith in ourselves, then we do not have a container. God says, "I am ready to give My Blessing, but how will you hold it? Where is the vessel?" That vessel we call receptivity. When we have receptivity, God pours His Blessings into our vessel.</p>
<p>No past, no future — only present, present, present! Have faith in God. Have faith in yourself. Have faith in your soul. Have faith in your Master. Then the road becomes clear. You do not have to see the destination. The destination itself is coming to you.</p>

<p><em>Question:</em> Is your physical mind aware of all the things that you do, Guru?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to go beyond the physical. If you do not go beyond the physical, you cannot do two things at once; the inner and the outer you cannot do at the same time. In your case, outer things you can do simultaneously. You are doing something with your hands and something else with your legs. But if you want to do the inner and the outer together, you must go beyond the physical. For you, one door is closed. You have kept the outer door open, so you are seeing what is happening in the outer world. The other door is closed, so you have to go through the door to see what is happening. But if you realise God, although the door is closed, you can see through the door like an X-ray machine. What is happening in the inner world and what is happening in the outer world you can see.</p>

All kinds of excellent reports I have got from one of your fellow workers. Do you have a question? I will answer it very quickly!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Question:</em> Sometimes I find myself in total darkness, but you lead me back to my spiritual life. You are taking me to the Goal. How can we invoke God's Grace so we do not lose you in our spiritual life?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The answer I will be able to give you. There is one easier than the easiest way. You love me; I love you. Now, comparison has to come into the picture. You have to feel constantly — if not constantly, then every day — that I love you infinitely more than you can love yourself. First you have to feel that I love you infinitely more than you love me — that is absolutely true. And the second part of the answer is that I love you infinitely more than you can love yourself.</p>
<p>These are not mere words, because I am dealing with your soul. This is not your first incarnation, good boy, and it is not your last incarnation. I am dealing with Eternity. Since I am dealing with Eternity, automatically Infinity comes into existence. Eternity and Infinity go together. These are not just English dictionary words. These are realities. When I deal with the soul, it is a matter of Infinity. Unfortunately, you cannot deal with your soul, or your soul is unable to deal with you because you have a mind, you have a vital, you have a body, and there your problem starts! But I can deal with your soul. Your soul has a free access to me, and I have a free access to your soul. That means I am able to handle Eternity and Infinity together. This body lives for seventy, eighty or ninety years, and then it is finished. But the soul brings the message of Immortality.</p>
<p>Think of any disciple, no matter how good he is or how absolutely bad he is. There is one "famous" disciple whom you know. How many people have his heart? His vital life is unthinkable, but when it is a matter of his pure heart, I do not think he loves anybody else except me. Believe me, it is absolutely true! He is impossible in his vital life, but when I concentrate on his heart — let us not even think about the aspiring heart — I see that his heart's love is for nobody else on earth, only for me. When it comes to vital life, emotional problems, he is to be found there. He is prominent in the vital world. But when it comes to a pure heart that loves only one person, if you have to identify his heart and his life-breath, you will see that he loves Sri Chinmoy and nobody else. In his outer life, where he is, God only knows! But I know the oneness of his heart with my heart. There are a few "famous" disciples like that.</p>
<p>In your case, there is no comparison between you and those people. But I wish to say that you and all my disciples have to convince yourselves that I love you infinitely more than you can love yourselves. And again, I have told you that you cannot love me as much as I love you. On the outer plane, if you have ten million dollars, let us say, then poor me, in comparison I have a hundred dollars. You may be able to give me millions of dollars, but I will be able to give you a maximum of one hundred dollars. If you are pleased with me, you can give me millions of dollars in terms of outer wealth. If I am pleased with you, the maximum I can offer you is one hundred dollars. I am giving you a simple example to show that you are infinitely richer in the material world than I am.</p>
<p>But that is only in outer terms. In spirituality, in aspiration and dedication, I am dealing with Infinity and Eternity. If you want to give me something outwardly, you can give me so much more than I can give you. In exactly the same way, all the disciples must feel that I love them infinitely more than they can love me. The mind will say that is impossible. The mind will not allow that thought. It will say, "Oh, I have got stomach pain. Is Guru thinking of me? I am the sufferer!" Outwardly I may say, "How are you feeling?" That is like the ordinary communication between a mother and son. The mother will say, "O my God, my son has got a stomach upset." But you will see that inside the pain itself is my soul, because your soul is bringing the message to me.</p>
<p>Always we have to bring divinity to the forefront and say, "My Guru is dealing with my eternal life. My Guru is dealing with Infinity." Every day a disciple should say that I love him infinitely more than he can ever love himself or love me. When that feeling comes, darkness goes away! Darkness may come, but inside the darkness there will be this thought: "O my God, my Guru is there — no matter how dark it is; no matter what consciousness I am in, even if I am in hell. My Guru is there no matter how many months I have not been able to pray and meditate."</p>
<p>A seeker may have a dry period. Swami Vivekananda said and Sri Aurobindo said that a dry period could last for six months or even two years. But if we invoke the devotional aspect, then the dry period does not come. All the time we have to invoke the devotional aspect. I am not comparing myself with any other spiritual figures, but I wish to say that from the very beginning I took the devotional approach. Sri Ramakrishna did not go through a dry period — never — because from the very beginning he took the devotional approach. If my disciples take the devotional approach, they do not have to go through a dry period.</p>
<p>When it is a matter of love, sometimes you love me, but sometimes you do not love me when you have a mental conflict. Surrender comes for five seconds, but then for five days or five years surrender may disappear. But if devotion is there, if devotion is all the time alive, it becomes the bridge, the link. It connects love and surrender. It makes the connection absolutely tight! This side is love, that side is surrender. Love and surrender are connected by devotion.</p>
<p>Some disciples stand in front of me with folded hands, but their minds are somewhere else. Let us say you are folding your hands, and you really feel that your submission or your surrender is complete. You can fold your hands twenty-four hours a day, whether devotion is there or not. You may only be putting your two hands together. But while you are putting your palms together, if devotion is alive inside you, then no problem arises.</p>
<p>To you I am saying, inside darkness or inside your suffering or pain, only keep love. You and all the disciples must keep love inside your suffering. You may say, "I am suffering so much, but I am doing this service, I am doing that service." Somebody else will say, "O my God, what am I doing working in the rain? I am working in the storm, and Guru is at home sleeping." That is what the mind will say. But the heart will say, "This service I am doing in the rain, during the thunderstorm, because of my Guru's love for me and because of my love for my Guru."</p>
<p>Those who serve our Marathon Team races will say they do it because of their love for me and my love for them. If they do not feel my love, then they will be somewhere else. And if I do not feel their love, then they will no longer serve me in that job. It is a matter of mutual love: my love for them and their love for me. Their souls and hearts will say, "Physically my Guru is not here in this storm, and so many problems I am facing. But inside each problem, my Guru is coming to give the answer. He is coming to solve the problem." That kind of attitude the disciples should have: "I have problems, but my Guru will be there to solve my problems in and through me."</p>
<p>When you have dark periods, when you have problems, always feel that this is a game—the Cosmic Game. You have been watching videos of the Mahabharata. Who won the war? In the end, it was the good people, the righteous people, the Pandavas. Suffering is always there. As long as there is ignorance, we shall have to suffer. We shall be kicked, kicked, kicked. The football goes from this side to that side, and finally one party wins. The good party, the party that has light, is bound to win. If truth prevails, life prevails. When you say, "Life prevails," that means, "My Guru is with me, in me and for me." Always have this mantra, my divine child: "My Guru is with me, in me and for me." Then all your problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Ask one question in your life: many years ago, was there any disciple who cared for me as much as you did when I was suffering, when I was practically dying? Absolutely my case became very serious. You were the only one to know that I could not walk any more. You were always with me. You were with me everywhere. I could not breathe. For three days I could not take a normal breath. I suffered so much! Five or six people massaged me. My case became very serious. If it had continued one day more, I would have called a doctor. And what were you doing? Everywhere I went, you were there. You were the one to come if I needed something. Do you remember that? All the time, you were the only one to remain only ten metres behind me, or beside me. You were the only one going on, going on. Will I ever forget this?</p>
<p>You may forget. You have had twenty million problems since then, so you may forget. But I shall never forget. This incident I have told a few times. Your heart became absolutely one with my heartbeat while I was suffering so badly. I sat down and I could not breathe, I could not breathe, and you were always serving me — physically, not spiritually, not inwardly. Physically you served me. How can I forget these things?</p>
<p>Then again, at times when the computer takes you away from your spirituality, I say, "Now stop, stop!" Computer, internet, e-mail: for me, these three can carry hostile forces, like the <em>rakshashas</em> that we see in the Mahabharata. They carry so many evil things. They help people, true; but in terms of taking mankind from divinity, they are real culprits. I have been saying this for the last ten years.</p>
<p>Again, that one good thing that you did is stuck in my mind! As soon as I see you are doing something wrong, I say to myself, "My God, he did such service for me!" For those four or five days what you did will last eternally inside my heart, inside my life-breath. To all my disciples I am saying that when you do something good for me, I eternally remember it. You may forget, because in between your good deeds you may do quite a few things wrong. At that time you may forget that such an immortal thing you have done in my life.</p>
<p>You all have done good things, but you do not want to remember the good things. You only want to remember all the bad things that you have done since the beginning of Creation! Always try to think of how many good things you have done, all of you. Then the bad things will disappear. But if you want to say, "I am a sinner, I am a sinner, I confess," then you will remain a sinner. Instead you should say, "I have done this good thing, I have done that good thing." Then you will get tremendous joy, tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous inner strength to destroy your undivine qualities. Always say, "I have done this, I have done this, I have done this!" Then the divine forces that worked in and through you will come to your rescue.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be my short answer! Always think of how many good things you have done for me. If you think of how many good things you have done, then the wrong things cannot stand against you. Do not identify with any of the bad things that you have done or that you may do in the future — forget about them! Only think of the good things, the good things. Then the good things will get the strength of ten lions. If you give importance to the bad things, each one, even if it is like a goat, will turn into a devouring tiger. Never give importance to the things you have done wrong. Only think of the good things that you have done, or the good things that I have done.</p>
<p>You can even think of how many times I have scolded you! If you can remember those scoldings, then you will see whether I scolded you for my good or for your good. It was for your good. But eventually who gets the benefit? I get the benefit! If I can help you turn into an excellent instrument, is that not my benefit? In the meantime, you get the scolding, but you will see that it is for your good.</p>
<p>For a short time, a very short time, you got from me a "vacation" from our path, for your illumination. Who suffered? I suffered infinitely more than you — "infinitely" is the right word! When you got the vacation, I suffered infinitely more than you suffered. Then the darkness was over. Now you are in the light, in the effulgence. People never realise that when they suffer because I become strict with their life and I take some outer action, I am the sufferer in and through them. Then again, when an individual comes back to light from darkness, he values my strictness.</p>
<p>But sometimes people can do stupid things! They feel that they have to go to darkness in order to appreciate light. That is absolutely the wrong approach. Our philosophy is to go from light to more light, to abundant light, to infinite Light. We now have abundant light, and we are aiming at infinite Light.</p>

Is there ever a time when he displays his affection and devotion to you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Affection, love, admiration and fondness I receive from Swami Vivekananda. Devotion I cannot expect! Devotion he has to keep for his Guru. But affection, love, fondness and admiration he has shown me many, many, many, many times. On the earthly level I came down after him. Devotion he has to keep always for his Master. But I have received affection, love, fondness and admiration from him many, many times. And the same blessings I have received from his Master, Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>Once, perhaps twice, they came to visit me in the inner world, and then we had a long conversation. I phoned my sister Lily in India, and she told me that she already knew about our conversation. She saw very clearly that on the previous night Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda were with me, and they came to her as well. Our family is very, very close to Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishna.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers, including the Indian Express, had so many articles about Swami Vivekananda. They have such admiration for him. India was fast asleep, and he said, "Get up, get up, get up! Arise, awake, awake!" Then his indomitable spirit destroyed or illumined the lethargy of India. He was dynamic, dynamic, dynamic!</p>
<p>On one of our Christmas Trips, I was lifting weights when Swami Vivekananda came inwardly. I said, "It cannot be!" Then he threw his walking stick near me. In those days when I was lifting heavy, heavy weights, how many times he came, sometimes for fifteen or twenty days in a row at a particular place, only to watch and to encourage me. And he appeared when I was walking in the street. He was everywhere, everywhere, everywhere!</p>
<p>Closer than the closest is our connection. Some disciples of Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishna may find it difficult to believe. At the centenary of Swami-ji's presentation at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, where he became immortal, the organisers wanted me to open the session. It was about Swami Vivekananda's triumph, and God has His own Ways. With my prayer and meditation, I opened the Chicago Conference.</p>
<p>The soul of America is blessing us today. Yesterday at our gathering everyone sang "America the Beautiful" very, very nicely, and today Paree's group has sung the songs about Swami Vivekananda very, very beautifully. Soul, soul, soul!</p>
<p>This morning at 5:20, Vinaya was driving me to Goose Pond Park. Vinaya is very fond of the ducks there. I started my one-mile walk. Right from the first step, Swami Vivekananda was walking with me inwardly for one full mile. A very thin crane was watching us. On the earthly level, I saw one Indian, a Hindi-speaker. He was lying down most comfortably on a bench, speaking on the phone. God alone knows whether it was his wife or someone else that he was speaking with. I passed by, and when I came back, he was still talking. I went around again. I walked comfortably for over eighteen minutes, and Swami Vivekananda was with me inwardly, chatting and chatting.</p>
<p>Afterwards Vinaya took me to see our 3,100-mile race. Swami Vivekananda also saw the race. There, when I was about to start another mile, Swami Vivekananda said, "Good-bye." For that mile I was walking all alone. For Swami Vivekananda to be with me for eighteen minutes! This is not my mental hallucination; it is all my God-oneness-realisation. With such affection he was walking with me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Guru, one time you said that Swami Vivekananda came and took away your knee pain, and the relief lasted for a day or two. I was wondering if there is any way of explaining his motivation, and if he would ever do it again?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Guru, one time you said that Swami Vivekananda came and took away your knee pain, and the relief lasted for a day or two. I was wondering if there is any way of explaining his motivation, and if he would ever do it again?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why did he do that for one or two days? Only to do me a favour! Once there was a long-distance walk around the track at Jamaica High School, and I was in such pain. Inwardly, Sri Ramakrishna touched my knee and took my pain away. I was so happy, and I walked 200 or 300 metres. Alas, then the pain came back. Sri Ramakrishna said, "I can do this much. The rest is between you and your Supreme." I was in such agony, and then I was so thrilled that my pain had gone away. Alas, after I had covered another 200 metres, the pain came back. I said, "What is this? The pain is back." Sri Ramakrishna said, "I can only do this much for you. A permanent cure is between you and your Supreme."</p>
<p>On the physical plane I have the same experience. When my Chinese doctor gives me an injection for my pain, I feel better for two weeks. The pain does not go away, but I feel better, so I am in the seventh Heaven. Then, after two weeks, alas, alas, the pain comes back, and my doctor gives me another treatment. I trust him! I have such love for him. And I must say, at least the pain does not increase!</p>
<p>In this world a kind of miracle many have performed, by touching people. But unfortunately these are not like Jesus Christ's miracles, because the doctors and others are not Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ touched people, and their pain went away. It did not come back. In my case, some people show me a so-called miracle, but it lasts for only a very short time. Then the problem comes back very nicely.</p>
<p>There is not a single spiritual Master who has not suffered on the physical plane. Each one has suffered. Perhaps there are some spiritual Masters who have suffered physically much, much more than I have been suffering — much, much more. But there is not a single spiritual Master who did not have physical pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes a spiritual Master will blame his disciples, and sometimes the disciples blame themselves for the Master's suffering. God alone knows who is responsible: the Master himself or the disciples. In my case I always say, "No disciple is responsible. It is not their problem. No, it is my problem. I am responsible for my suffering." Sri Ramakrishna said to his disciples, "I have got cancer in my throat because I have taken the sins of all of you." How many disciples did Sri Ramakrishna have? At that time he had sixteen or twenty disciples. Openly he said, "I have taken your sins. They are all inside my throat." Other Masters also said similar things. But in my case I will never say that I am getting pain from the karma of my disciples — no, no, no.</p>
