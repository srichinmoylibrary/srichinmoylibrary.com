<p><em>Mr. Matsumoto:</em> I am most grateful and most honoured to be here on this occasion. When I first met Sri Chinmoy, I felt that God had sent such a saintly person to earth to help us find a way to inner peace. For many years I had been hoping to find a way.</p>
<p>I come from a poor family, one that has suffered a great deal. First, it was my father who passed away, then my mother. Following this, my son died as well. But I always had the hope that I would find inner peace, the ultimate peace. Now I have been given the golden opportunity to be in Sri Chinmoy's blessingful presence. He has given me this plaque and garland. Then the singers sang the song he wrote for me. I am so grateful that Sri Chinmoy has given me these precious gifts. I feel it is God who has sent such a saintly person into my life. I feel that when I ascend to the Heavenly skies, I will take with me this most soulful song you have composed for me, and I will be very happy with this song.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From the depths of my heart I would like to offer to the soul of Kyoto a soulful poem which I composed today:</p>

<p>Kyoto</p>
<p>Kyoto, Kyoto, Kyoto, Kyoto,<br /> Japan's sweetness-fulness motto.<br /> Here life is energy's speedy flow.<br /> Here heart is ecstasy's<br /> splendid glow.<br /> Kyoto, Kyoto, you I salute.<br /> You play the world's<br /> oneness-peace-flute.</p>

<p><em>Reporter:</em> From now on, what kind of activities will you do for peace?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you want peace, you must pray and meditate every day. Hiroshima is the city where unimaginable destruction took place. The old was destroyed, and now the new has been built. This experience of building the new should continue and continue forever here in Hiroshima.</p>

JSBH 18-32. Tokyo, 23 September 1987</p>
<h2><em>Mu Magazine:</em> What was your motivation for offering concerts in Japan at this time?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have a very special love and affection for Japan. Right from the first time I came to Japan many years ago, when I didn't even have one disciple here, I still felt my oneness with Japan. Japan always gives me joy and a powerful thrill that touches the depths of my heart. When I think of Japan, I immediately see lamps. Japan is composed of small islands, and I see these islands as soulful aspiration-lamps that are climbing up high, higher, highest. The flames from these lamps are going up and reaching the highest, which is all beauty, love and power.</p>
<p>There are a few other things about Japan that also give me enormous joy. Simplicity and humility are of supreme importance in life. Japan has them both. I have been all over the world, but I can tell you that no other country has simplicity and a heart of humility in the pure sense that Japan has.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Inside my mind there is nothing, absolutely nothing. I don't think of anything. At that time I enter into the world of vastness. There I clearly see and feel a sea of peace. I bring this peace down into the hearts of all those who are kind enough to come and listen to my music.</p>

Is it to inspire people who have different likes and dislikes and different tastes?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we go to a department store, you can buy things that you like and I can buy things that I like. But if there is only one thing, perhaps some people won't like that thing. Some people like one instrument while others like another instrument. Again, by playing many instruments, I feel I can offer more inspiration. If a tree has quite a few leaves and beautiful flowers, then it offers more inspiration than if it has only one flower. Since I am a servant of God, if I can be of more service to you by offering ten flowers instead of one flower, then I will be more satisfied. I feel that people who come also will be more satisfied because the fragrance and beauty of ten flowers will given them more joy than one flower. It is like Japan. Japan has so many islands. Each one adds so much more beauty and joy to the Japanese consciousness, and inspires more love for Japan.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Those days were filled with an inner cry for God, and I meditated for hours and hours a day.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God is everywhere. But when we talk about God in the sky or on top of a mountain, He seems more distant than when we talk about God in our own heart. We get the most intimate feeling when we think of our heart. Even when we are thinking of our own body, we get much more joy when we think of the heart than when we think of our fingers or hands or nose. From the heart we get the dearest feeling. Why? Because God is much more manifested inside the heart than elsewhere in our being. God is inside bad people and He is also inside good people. But I only want to mix with saints and good people and not bad people, because God is more manifested in good people. Similarly, God is everywhere in the body, but God's Presence can be felt most convincingly and powerfully inside the heart.</p>
<p>So when I speak of the Inner Pilot, I mean God who is inside the heart. He is also inside the sky, a mountain, everywhere. But I get the most joy when I think of Him and feel Him inside my own heart as my Inner Pilot guiding me through life. Those who pray and meditate are conscious of His Presence.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I recommend meditation on the heart. Many meditation techniques teach us to eliminate worldly thoughts and to empty the mind, but in my case, I teach my students to concentrate on the heart and to meditate on the heart. This is because the heart is different from the mind in the sense that it does not compare or discriminate, saying that this person is better than that person, or that person is more beautiful than another. The heart has the quality of wanting to become one with others. The mind has finite limitations, but the heart is infinite.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When a seeker has reached the level where he is on the verge of God-realisation, he will be able to meditate whenever he wants and wherever he wants. But until he reaches that level, he needs to meditate regularly and devotedly every day at a proper place for meditation. This place is an individual's own shrine, where flowers, candles and spiritual pictures may be placed, and where incense may be burned in order to create a meditative atmosphere. No matter how busy one is, one should be able to spend a short period of time out of an entire day in meditation. One can definitely make the time if one wants to.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am getting help from something within me. Suppose someone is able to lift 30 kg only with the power of his muscles. If he prays and meditates for a few minutes before he lifts, he will get help not only from his body, but also from his mind and from his vital. Right now he is getting help only from the body. He is not getting help from the tremendous power of determination that is inside the vital, from the tremendous will-power that is inside the mind or from the bliss that is inside the heart. He does not even know that these things exist.</p>
<p>But if he prays and meditates, immediately he will be able to feel the will-power and concentration that the mind has. And if he thinks of the vital, his mind will be filled with determination and his body filled with energy. He will feel that his own vital, mind, heart and soul are all his friends, and that he will be able to get help from all of these friends. Friends help us and even save us. In this way, weightlifting becomes easier.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Right now, many people do not yet believe in the inner power, or the inner world. They feel that the outer power or the outer world is everything. No. Only because of the inner life, the soul, does the outer life exist.</p>
<p>Through prayer and meditation, one has to bring the inner power or capacity to the fore. Ignorance stands in front of us, but if determination and aspiration join together, these two friends can definitely help us in the battlefield of life.</p>
<p>Among the professional weightlifters, there are now people who feel the existence of inner power, or something that can be called the soul, and they believe that this inner power, or soul, is helping their bodybuilding or their weightlifting.</p>
