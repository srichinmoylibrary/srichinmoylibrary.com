<p><em>(The three children are together in the palace of their father.)</em></p>
<p>YAMA: We are so proud to have such parents. Our father is so great; our mother is so beautiful.</p>

<p>YAMUNA: I am the happiest woman in God’s Creation. My father is the most powerful of all the gods. My mother is the most beautiful woman of all. We are the children of the most powerful and illumining, and of the most beautiful and charming parents. None can be prouder than we three.</p>

<p>SANJNA: Chhaya! <em>(Enter Chbaya.)</em> Chhaya, I have made a decision. I have lived with my beloved Lord for many years, but slowly his fiery brightness is killing me. His light is so powerful that his very presence tortures me. When I look at him I am blinded; when I take a breath I breathe in only fire. I am burning up. His golden rays are destroying my very existence. It is impossible for me to stay with him in spite of his deep love for me. I wish you to replace me.</p>
<p>CHHAYA <em>(with enormous joy)</em>: I will be Surya’s wife?</p>
<p>SANJNA: Yes, Chhaya. He will not know. Even when he comes home after offering his light to Heaven and earth, his brilliance remains always with him. His own brilliance will blind him, and he will not realise that you are not his real wife.</p>
<p>CHHAYA: I am so grateful to you, Mistress, for allowing me to replace you.</p>
<p>SANJNA <em>(blessing Chhaya)</em>: You take my place. I am going to take shelter in a cool, dense forest. There I shall live my own life, and everything will be mild, cool and soothing.</p>

<p>NARRATOR: In the course of time Surya and Chhaya had three children — also two boys and a girl. Their names were Shani, Manu and Tapti. Although they were step-brothers and step-sisters, Yama, Vaivaswatha and Yamuna became very good friends with Shani, Manu and Tapti. They were all very affectionate to each other. And although Chhaya was secretly fonder of her own children than of Sanjna’s children, she used to hide her favouritism for fear that Sanjna’s children would betray her secret.</p>
<p><em>(Chhaya is secretly offering special sweets and gifts to her three children. Enter Yama suddenly and sees her.)</em></p>
<p>YAMA <em>(furious)</em>: You impostor! Are you like that, then? We never thought that you were so mean. You are offering sweets and gifts to your own children and not to us. You maidservant! We have kept the secret that you were our mother’s handmaid because we did not want our father to be angry with our mother, yet even then you show favouritism to your own children. You did not marry our father. To think that you act as his wife! You are not fit to be called mother by us! Had our father known that you were not his real wife he would have killed you long ago! You worthless creature! I shall kick you!</p>
<p>CHHAYA: Stop, Yama! Don’t you dare kick me! I curse you! You will suffer tremendous pain in your right leg, and soon you will not be able to walk on it. You will be crippled.</p>

<p><em>(Outside Surya’s room. Enter Yama and knocks at the door. Surya is not inside. Yama waits outside the door. Enter Surya.)</em></p>
<p>SURYA: Yama, what do you want? Is there something wrong?</p>
<p>YAMA: Father, I have something to tell you.</p>
<p>SURYA: Why are you so frightened and sad? What is wrong, my son?</p>
<p>YAMA: Father, I have been cursed.</p>
<p>SURYA: By whom?</p>
<p>YAMA: By my mother.</p>
<p>SURYA: Oh, well, don’t worry. What did she say?</p>
<p>YAMA: She said I will be crippled; my right leg will be paralyzed.</p>
<p>SURYA: Don’t worry. She is your mother. A mother’s curse does not come true. <em>(Yama’s leg is already swollen and painful. He cannot move it at all.)</em> It is very strange, but it seems that her curse has come true. Well, don’t worry, my son. Your mother was angry with you for some reason, but I shall cure you. <em>(Using his occult power he cures Yama’s leg.)</em> My son, I have always heard that a mother’s curse on her children will never come true, for the lives of her children are dearer to her than her own life. I can’t understand why your mother’s curse affected you. Even if you did something wrong, something very serious, still she is your mother. For her to curse you and for her curse to come true is very strange, very strange. There must be something wrong.</p>
<p>YAMA: Father, shall I tell you the secret?</p>
<p>SURYA: What is your secret, my son? Tell me.</p>
<p>YAMA: Father, you have the deepest love for our mother, Sanjna. But I must tell you that she left us long ago. She was afraid of you. Your brilliance blinded her. Your fiery looks burned her. Your very presence tortured her. She could not bear your power and your brilliance, so she asked her handmaid, Chhaya, to take her place and be our mother. Now she is living in the thick, cool forest. We did not tell you because we thought that you would bring our mother back and then she would die. But today I saw my step-mother, Chhaya, giving sweets and gifts secretly to her own children. I got angry and threatened to kick her. When I said this she cursed me, and her curse came true because she is not my real mother.</p>
<p>SURYA <em>(stupefied)</em>: Sanjna is gone? My beloved Sanjna has left me? I have been giving all my love and affection to an impostor? Yama, Yama, my son, what shall I do? I must have my darling Sanjna back. But I do not want to hurt her. I do not want to burn her with my fiery presence.</p>
<p>YAMA: Perhaps, Father, there is someone who will know how to diminish your fiery power. Then Mother can come back to you.</p>
<p>SURYA: You are right. Tell Vayu to search the entire universe until he finds someone who can diminish my light.</p>
<p>YAMA: Yes, Father. I shall tell him.</p>

<p>VISHWAKARMA: Surya, I am the architect of this universe. I can take away enough of your brilliance so that my daughter will be able to live with you again. Here is my lathe. I shall grind off an eighth part of your brightness and power. This eighth will fall to earth shining and blazing. But before it touches the ground I shall transform it, I shall shape it.

<p>SANJNA: I always loved you, I love you still. But the brilliance of your light was killing me. That was the only reason I left you. I forgive you, my dearest husband. With all my heart I forgive you.</p>

<p>SANJNA: Father, Father, you have saved us. We really loved each other. Surya loved me, and I loved him wholeheartedly. Only I could not bear his fiery presence.

<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Shaivya, dearest to my heart and nearest to my soul, I have not heard you sing for a long, long time. Please do me a great favour: sing a song.</p>
<p><em>(Shaivya sings.)</em></p>
<p>Into the world of beauty’s flame, Into the world of offering’s game, Into the world of lustre-flood, I came, I came, my existence came.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Shaivya, your life’s name is duty. Your soul’s name is beauty. Your heart’s name is purity. And the name of your voice is the flood of ecstasy. Shaivya, in you I am complete, and with you I am perfect.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly, the King and the Queen hear a most pitiful cry.)</em></p>
<p>THE VOICE: Save me! Help me! Save me! Help me!</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra runs at top speed toward the sound. He comes to a spot where Vishwamitra is rapt in trance. The King is fully aware of the fact that Vishwamitra’s anger is not only of the quickest but also of the wildest. Immediately he touches the feet of the sage. With his hands folded he speaks.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage of the highest magnitude, your august forgiveness my tremulous heart implores. I have tortured your sublime peace. Your forgiveness I deserve not, but my heart longs for your compassion-flood.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Your end is come. Today marks the end of your earthly existence. You heard the voice of the spirit crying. I want to conquer the spirit of sciences. I want to control the spirit. I want to lord it over the spirit. Tremendous success was fast approaching my fearsome attempt. But now, you fool, you rascal, you have ruined everything. Prepare yourself to brave my fatal curse. In the twinkling of an eye, my Third Eye shall utterly destroy your entire Kingdom!</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O peerless sage, kill me; destroy my life, but not my Kingdom. Innocent are my subjects. Pure is my Kingdom. Destroy them not, I pray. Demand anything else. In no time I shall fulfil your express command, in no time!</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: All right. Remember your promise. If you fail to fulfil your promise, my all-destructive curse shall embrace your most beautiful Kingdom. You have badly and shamelessly prevented me from fulfilling my desire of today. Tomorrow I shall come to your palace and bless you with my second and last, absolutely last desire. Tomorrow if you fail, your existence and the existence of your vast Kingdom will be found in the land of nowhere.</p>

<p><em>(Vishwamitra rushes in.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, give me your Kingdom! Leave it with me now and forever. This is my Kingdom. You must immediately leave my palace and my Kingdom. Today if you break your promise of yesterday, your life and your Kingdom’s life will be doomed all at once. Yesterday I wanted to destroy you and your Kingdom. But today I just want to have your Kingdom. That’s all.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O most venerable Sir, to you I offer my Kingdom, my Kingdom’s heart and soul. My eyes and feet shall now proceed toward an uncharted land.</p>
<p>SHAIVYA <em>(to King)</em>: My Lord, you can never go alone. You cannot deny the breath of my heart. You cannot deny our fondest child Rohitashwa. Your son and I shall follow you. You are our all. You are sincerity’s all. You are truth’s all.</p>
<p><em>(Shaivya sings the farewell song to the palace.)</em></p>
<p>O Lord, where is the Truth? “Where your Beloved is.” Who is my Beloved, who? “In whom your life is peace.”</p>
<p><em>(The King, the Queen and the little Prince bow down to the sage Vishwamitra and are ready to leave the palace. The helpless ministers and the commander-in-chief offer their heartfelt and soulful affection, love, appreciation, admiration and adoration to their beloved King.)</em></p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Your Majesty, you will always be remembered with highest praise, deepest fondness and mightiest adoration.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Enough! Shut up!</p>
<p>MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Your Majesty, without any hyperbolical encomiums, you are a King in the highest degree amiable and adorable.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Enough! Shut up!</p>
<p>MINISTER OF FINANCE: Your Majesty, I have served you with transcendental joy and pride.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Enough! Shut up!</p>
<p>MINISTER OF COMMERCE: Your Majesty, your supremely devoted life may now pass in penury, but never in obscurity.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Enough! Shut up!</p>
<p>COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: Your Majesty, we shall, before long, thunder against this heartless brute. We shall without fail bring you back to your Kingdom.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Enough, enough, enough! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You feeble heart, you insignificant creature! <em>(Turning toward Harish Chandra.)</em> Harish Chandra, delay not! My indomitable will shall brook no delay. Leave my palace. Leave my Kingdom.</p>
<p><em>(The King, the Queen and the Prince leave the palace. On the way, innumerable subjects pay their last homage in silence to the royal family. Pure love wells forth from the inmost recesses of their hearts.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Harish Chandra, Shaivya and Rohitashwa have travailed a few miles. All of a sudden they hear a frightening voice. They turn around only to see Vishwamitra approaching them in the greatest hurry imaginable.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Stop, Harish Chandra! I had not the slightest idea that you were a rogue of the deepest dye. No doubt you have made a generous gift. But what about the <em>dakshina</em>, the sacerdotal fee? I believe you are an Aryan. I believe you are an Indian. Have I to remind you of the simplest religious practice that any gift offered to someone must needs be followed by <em>dakshina</em>? Tell me why and how you have managed to forget such a simple thing. Shall I call you the worst possible fool, or the worst possible rogue? I think the latter you rightly deserve.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage, at your feet I placed everything that I had. Nothing have I now. Please give me a fleeting month. At the end of the month I shall offer you my humble <em>dakshina</em>.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, remember your promise. When this month comes to an end I shall approach you and demand my absolutely legitimate due.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage, by your grace, by God’s Grace, I shall be worthy of my heart’s soulful promise. At the end of the month please bless me with your august presence and collect your due.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: All right.</p>

<p><em>(The King, the Queen and the little Prince wander from place to place, land to land, with no destination whatsoever.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Alas, how can I pay my <em>dakshina</em> to the sage? The fateful month is nearly over. I have left no stone unturned to get a job. No, not a single soul is kind enough to employ me. They say I am weak. They feel I shall be of no use to them. Alas, stark starvation is responsible for my poor health.</p>
<p>ROHITASHWA: Mother, Mother, I am very hungry. I am very tired. I cannot walk, I shall not walk any farther. My head, my stomach and my feet are burning like a hot oven. Look at my feet, look! They are full of blisters. I think I have run a thorn into my left foot. Where are our horses? Where is my father’s chariot?</p>
<p>SHAIVYA <em>(shedding unavoidable tears)</em>: My child, we are nearing a temple. It is the best temple in Varanasi, I am sure they will give us something to eat. And perhaps your father will get a job there. Then we shall be rich and happy again.</p>
<p><em>(The three arrive at the temple gate in the small hours of the morning.)</em></p>
<p>PRIEST: Who are you? What brings you people here at this odd hour?</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: We have been travelling and travelling. We are hungry and exhausted, Our son is totally exhausted and extremely hungry. We shall be so grateful to you if you bless him with some <em>prasad</em> from your holy temple.</p>
<p><em>(The priest goes inside the temple and brings some prasad for the child and gives it to him. The hungry child eats with greatest joy. )</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Thanks, thanks a million times to you, O chosen son of God! Would you care to fulfil another desire of mine?</p>
<p>PRIEST: Certainly, by all means, if it is within my capacity.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Could you give me some work here?</p>
<p>PRIEST: Work! What kind of work? Oh, no, I can’t give you any work. impossible. Your face shows all the marks of a Kshatriya. I can’t employ a Kshatriya to work under me. This is a temple. Here only the Brahmins are supposed to work. Kshatriya, no. Vaishya, no. Shudra, no. Only a Brahmin. I am sorry, you must look for a job elsewhere.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: I shall. Anyway I deeply thank you for the food Our son’s precious life is saved. Thank you again.</p>

<p><em>(The family is wandering along a crowded street.)</em></p>
<p>SHAIVYA: The month is over today. I am sure the sage will not forget us.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: I am sure he will not forgive us.</p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra comes rushing in.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, today ends the month. Where is your <em>dakshina</em>, where?</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: We know it, O great sage. But the day is not yet over. It will be at least four hours before the sun goes to sleep.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O sage, just before the day comes to its close please bless us with your divine presence. I shall, without fail, offer you my <em>dakshina</em>.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Remember, Harish Chandra, remember your promise!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Vishwamitra)</em> SHAIVYA: My Lord, look, there is a market. Let us go over there and see our fate.</p>
<p><em>(They enter the market. Here they see slaves being bought and sold.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Ah, at long last I have found the place. I am more than willing to be anybody’s slave. I shall sell myself. <em>(He approaches a rich man and with folded hands begs the man to buy him.)</em> Please, please buy me. I badly need money. I urgently need money.</p>
<p>RICH MAN: Sorry, I can’t buy you. I see no strength in your body. You will be a useless slave. Sorry, I won’t have you. But I will buy your wife. She can help my wife in the kitchen.</p>
<p><em>(Shaivya, overjoyed, with folded hands speaks to the kind customer.)</em></p>
<p>SHAIVYA: Be pleased to feel my heart’s gratitude. I want to help my husband. You are our saviour.</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra sinks his head into his palms.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O merciful Lord, have I to sell my own wife, my most precious treasure here on earth and there in Heaven? No, I simply can’t. My wife is infinitely dearer than my life itself.</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: You must not swerve from the path of truth. The preservation of truth is infinitely more important than the prestige of any human being. You cannot make a cowardly escape from reality. This is the hour when the divine courage must enfold you with its celestial wings. Who else will or can uphold the truth if not you, my beloved? You have to keep to your divine promise.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Yes, Shaivya, I remember my promise to the sage. But to sell you, my own, my very own?</p>
<p>SHAIVYA: Fear not, my Lord, this heart of mine shall remain eternally yours.</p>
<p>RICH MAN: I can’t waste any more time. <em>(Looking at Harish Chandra.)</em> Either sell your wife immediately or leave me alone. Take this sum of five hundred gold coins.</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra accepts the money with his head hanging in utter shame.)</em></p>
<p>RICH MAN <em>(turning toward Shaivya)</em>: You follow me.</p>
<p><em>(Rohitashwa starts crying and screaming.)</em></p>
<p>ROHITASHWA: Mother, Mother, where are you going? I can’t stay without you, Mother.</p>
<p>RICH MAN: All right. Let me give to the father two hundred and fifty gold coins for the son. Come along, you little fellow.</p>
<p>A VILLAGE BRAHMIN: Shame, shame! Look at this fellow. He has sold his wife and son. How can one sell one’s own wife and son? O God, did You not give a heart to this low creature when You gave him a human birth? O God, You alone know what more unthinkable things I shall have to see in Your Creation. O God, take me to the other world. This world is simply unbearable!</p>
<p><em>(The master, Shaivya and Rohitashwa start walking toward their destination while Harish Chandra walks along the street distressed and disheartened, with no destination at all.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Vishwamitra appears.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Harish Chandra, the time is up. Give me your <em>dakshina</em>.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Be pleased to accept this humble <em>dakshina</em>.</p>
<p><em>(He hands seven hundred and fifty gold coins to the sage.)</em></p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Shame! Shame! That’s not enough. Once upon a time you were a great King. Such a small <em>dakshina</em> is beneath your dignity. You must give me at least two hundred and fifty more gold coins. It is imperatively necessary. If not . . .</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O venerable sage! By your grace, by God’s Grace, one hour is still at my disposal. Please come to me before the last fateful hour fades. In the meantime I shall get the money.</p>
<p>VISHWAMITRA: Remember, remember your promise!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Vishwamitra)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O Lord Supreme, my beloved wife I have lost, and my only son I have lost. All, all I have lost except this wretched Harish Chandra. Let me go to the market again and see if I can sell my most unlucky body. If I fail to sell myself, then my boat shall sink right near the shore.</p>
<p><em>(Harish Chandra enters into the market.)</em></p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: O! Is there no kind-hearted man to buy me? I have come to sell myself, my body and my soul.</p>
<p><em>(A chandala [an undertaker] signals Harish Chandra. in his hands there is a stick and a skull.)</em></p>
<p>CHANDALA: Come here! Follow me! How much money do you want?</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Only two hundred and fifty gold coins.</p>
<p>CHANDALA: That’s all? There you are. <em>(He hands two hundred and fifty gold coins to Harish Chandra.)</em> Now follow me. Your duty is to wait on dead bodies. You have to demand from the members of the deceased’s family rice, cloth and money before you cremate the corpse.</p>
<p>HARISH CHANDRA: Indeed, I shall do that.</p>

One day the whole world will admire and adore your father for his great sense of truth and his tremendous and unprecedented sacrifice. Rohitashwa, go and play in the garden. I shall join you in the evening. Now I have to work hard in the kitchen. Today I shall make a most delicious meal for you, my son.</p>
