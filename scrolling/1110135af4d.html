<p>Beloved President Premadasa, O Supreme Pilot of the Sri Lankan Boat, to you I bow â€” to your ocean-wisdom-heart I bow. To you I offer my heart of infinite gratitude. (Sri Chinmoy chants: "Buddham saranam gachhami. Dhammam saranam gachhami. Saingham saranam gachhami.") I am praying to the Lord Buddha to bless our dear President Premadasa with a very, very long life flooded with inner progress and outer success. I am also praying to the Lord Buddha to shower His choicest Compassion-Light upon the sleeplessly aspiring heart and self-giving life of His beloved son, Premadasa, so that President Premadasa may love, serve, lead, guide, mould and shape his beloved Motherland, Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Once more I am offering gratitude from the inmost recesses of my heart to President Premadasa.</p>

<h2><em>Interviewer:</em> Guru, you are a man of peace, a disciple of peace. At a time when everyone in Sri Lanka is looking for peace, what is the special message you are bringing to the people of this country?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> My soulful message is this: We need peace desperately, and for that we must all establish the feeling of oneness. As soon as we can establish the feeling of oneness, peace will automatically be felt and manifested here and elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, I must tell you in all sincerity that politics is not my forte. But as a truth-seeker and a God-lover, I can offer my own soulful opinion. Let us say that when I was in need of your help, you were kind enough to come to my rescue. But when I feel that I am all right again, then I am doing the right thing when I tell you that I no longer need your help. It is like calling a doctor. When I have a physical ailment, I call a doctor and he comes to cure me. When I feel that I am completely cured, then I tell the doctor, "It was so kind of you to come and cure me. Now, fortunately, I no longer need your help. If necessity demands, if I fall sick again, then I will ask for your help again. But now I feel that I am perfectly all right and I can enjoy my health without your presence."Or let us say that you and I are friends. If I need your help desperately, immediately you come to help. But when I feel that my problem is solved, I thank you deeply and tell you that I can now manage on my own. If you are in trouble one day, I will be the first to come to your aid. And when you no longer need my help, you will ask me to go away. Friends can deal with each other like that.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely! What we badly need is peace. This is not the problem of an individual or a particular country. It is a collective problem. The whole world, throughout its length and breadth, needs peace desperately. Somebody has to start; then from one it spreads to many. When we enter into a garden, we can see many, many flowers. Each flower blossoms slowly and steadily â€” petal by petal. In exactly the same way, peace also will blossom. It will not happen all of a sudden.</p>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>On behalf of all the people of Sri Lanka, I am very happy to welcome you to our country. You are dedicated to peace. I am happy that you are travelling to all corners of the globe in order to spread the message of the oneness of humanity.</p>
<p>I understand that you have been hailed as the 20th Century's First Global man. I appreciate your services for achieving peace through so many fields, including music, writings, paintings, lectures and athletic endeavours.</p>
<p>I offer you my best wishes for your continued dedication and unceasing efforts for the cause of humanity and world peace.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>President Premadasa</p>

<p>Dear Chief Minister, I am extremely, extremely grateful to you for receiving me this evening in Ratnapura. I shall always treasure your most kind hospitality. I am also grateful to the Mayor for his very kind reception.</p>
<p>Ratnapura is the city of gems, and I see that its heart is also a gem. Its inner beauty and outer beauty have impressed me deeply. Also, to our dear friends and the distinguished members of the audience I am offering my heart of love and gratitude.</p>
<p>Over two thousand years ago, an Indian prince named Vijay Singh came to Sri Lanka with 70 followers. You accepted him as your own, very own. In this same tradition, Mr. Lakhan Mehrotra, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, has come to this country. I am more than hopeful that relations between India and Sri Lanka will now be strengthened more than ever, for he is a true peace-lover with a mind of unparalleled wisdom-light and a heart of universal oneness-concern.</p>
<p>Yesterday my students and I went to Sucharita, the Presidential Palace, to offer a Peace Concert. President Premadasa granted us his blessingful presence and his compassionate heart for over two hours. He is the voice of your country. He is cherished not only by all Sri Lankans but also by lovers of peace throughout the length and breadth of the world.</p>
<p>In a few days we shall carry to various parts of the world the experiences from our soulful and powerful journey through Sri Lanka. The experiences that we have received here will last forever in our prayerful and soulful gratitude-hearts.</p>

<p>My dear Minister of Sports and dear friends, in silence I am invoking the presence of the Lord Buddha to bless us all here....</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to the Minister of Sports for this signal honour that he has accorded to me. For about two weeks I have been in Sri Lanka, the island of beauty, purity and divinity. Here your beloved President Ranasinghe Premadasa has most powerfully blessed me with his inspiration, encouragement, kindness, sympathy and compassion....</p>
<p>Sports and physical fitness are of supreme importance for each and every human being because they help us to achieve inner peace.... So through physical activities, especially sports, we are dedicating ourselves to the betterment of this world.... I am so happy that President Premadasa is extremely fit physically. Needless to say, spiritually also he is super-fit. He pays attention to physical fitness as well as spiritual progress. In his unique book "Peace and Prosperity", the President teaches us: "In Sri Lanka, we have tried to blend both physical development and spiritual progress." Physical development and spiritual progress together can make us true and perfect citizens of the world.</p>
<p>The President every day shoulders millions of problems. At the same time, he is the voice of the people, the nation. But in spite of all this, he finds the time to keep his body in excellent shape. Indeed, this is a tremendous source of inspiration to me and to my students who practise sports.</p>
<p>.... In silence I am offering my heart's most soulful prayer to the Lord Buddha, the Author of all Good, to shower His compassionate Blessings on each of us so that we can be perfect instruments of His â€” loving and serving humanity both physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>Once more I am offering my heart's love and gratitude to the Minister of Sports and others who have organised today's programme. May each of us become a divine athlete to fight against ignorance-night and establish in Sri Lanka and all over the world the kingdom of love, brotherhood, oneness and fulfilment.</p>

<p>Your Holiness, to your soul of luminosity, your heart of compassion and your life of perfection I am offering gratitude, gratitude, gratitude from the inmost recesses of my heart. My heart is all gratitude to you, for you have included me, out of your infinite bounty, in your Buddhist family.</p>
<p>With your kind permission I am accepting this award as a most powerful blessing from the Buddha to intensify my own quest for truth and multiply my inner aspiration and outer dedication. This blessing I wish to have in my heart of aspiration, in my life of dedication and in all my earthly activities. To me, it is infinitely more precious than any outer award.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago, President Premadasa came here, as well as to other spiritual places in Kandy. Like you, he believes that all world religions are one and that all religions join together in the Compassion-Heart of the Lord Buddha. We are all one-children of the Absolute. There is no high, no low. We are all growing in the Heart of the Absolute. I understand that it was our beloved President who wanted to bless me with this supreme gift. So this award I am inwardly offering most devotedly to President Premadasa.</p>
<p>I wish to offer my most soulful love, joy and gratitude to my most esteemed Brother-Friend, Minister Arthur Ranasinghe. If we have been able to do anything for the soul and heart of Sri Lanka, it is because the Minister of Information has helped us far, far beyond my imagination and the imagination of my students.</p>
<p>And to all those who are present here, I am offering my gratitude for this great inspiration and aspiration that we have felt here together. Now we shall try to spread it throughout the length and breadth of the globe.</p>

<p>Honourable Mayor Hussain Mohamed, my dear friend, my dear brother, .... for the last thirteen days I have been here in the heart of Sri Lanka, which is a heart of beauty, purity, serenity and divinity. Each day, each hour, each minute, each second I have been loved and blessed by the soul of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is small in size, but in terms of its heart's divine qualities and life's magnanimity, Sri Lanka stands unparalleled....</p>
<p>During my stay here, I have seen that peace and harmony between India and Sri Lanka is more than a hopeful dream; it is a supremely blessed reality. The sincere peace-cries and oneness-smiles from the magnanimous hearts of my Sri Lankan brothers and sisters have touched the very depths of my being. In the same way, India's readiness-heart and willingness-mind for peace are being manifested most lovingly and most convincingly in her divinely chosen representative-son, Mr. Lakhan Mehrotra, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka....</p>
<p>A few days ago, our beloved President Ranasinghe Premadasa completed the first year of his most fruitful presidency. As the unparalleled President that he is, he went to the spiritual heads of the nation's four main religious faiths â€” Hindu, Christian, Muslim and Buddhist â€” to receive their blessings. Here the President has shown us that we all belong to the same world-family; we are all oneness-brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>....Tomorrow my students and I will leave Sri Lanka, but we will carry with us the sweeter-than-the-sweetest fragrance of the Sri Lankan heart. At the end of our sojourn here, I am offering to each and every Sri Lankan my gratitude, my infinite gratitude. Beyond expectation, beyond my highest flight of imagination, from the soul, heart and life of Sri Lanka I have received affection, love, compassion and blessings. And in return, most humbly, most soulfully and most devotedly I am offering my heart's tearful gratitude to the life, heart and soul of Sri Lanka.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I came here for your blessings.</h2>

<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> I am very privileged to have you here.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I wish to tell you how deeply some of your words have inspired and moved me. When you said, "I dedicate myself to lead my people to unity and amity, I dedicate myself to lead my people to calmness and sanity, I dedicate myself to lead my people to peace and harmony, I dedicate myself to lead my people to order and discipline," I felt that you are definitely the right person to be the supreme leader of your country. Something else extremely, extremely significant that you have said is that you think example is better than precept: "Discipline must begin with self-discipline."</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> How do you know these quotes?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have been reading your writings with utmost interest since I first thought of coming to your beautiful country.</p>
<p>[/The Prime Minister's Secretary said that they would like to have a course on Sri Chinmoy's music at the University./]</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> Do it! Do it!</p>
<p><em>[Sri Chinmoy then presented President Premadasa with a picture of the two of them taken at the Kandy Festival of Lights. He had autographed it at the bottom, with the words: "From a student of peace to the teacher of peace."]</em></p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> It is the other way around.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> [/Giving the President a picture of himself being lifted after the Peace Concert at Sucharita/] How did you feel?</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> You were strong, very strong! <em>[Pointing to one of the pictures]</em> Why did you not put the date here?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am so sorry; I forgot. But I have put the date on the other picture. <em>[Giving President Premadasa a letter</em>] This letter expresses my feelings about you and Sri Lanka. I was going to send this by mail, but since you so kindly made the time to see me, I am giving it to you in person. I have given six or eight talks here. On each occasion my heart has spoken about you. You have written in one of your books that the small must support the big; otherwise, the big cannot survive. You have always said that big and small must go together. You are the highest here, and you have given me so much love and compassion.</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> Affection, affection, affection! People tell me what you say about me at your concerts and other appearances. The Prime Minister told me that you kept my picture on the stage at your last concert! Did they sing my song again?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely! I cannot go out into the street without people recognising me and giving me such love and affection. You have taken me into your heart and also placed me inside the hearts of your people.</p>
<p>[/Sri Chinmoy then gave President Premadasa some of his own books, including "Siddhartha Becomes the Buddha" and "U Thant: Divinity's Smile, Humanity's Cry."/]</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I would like to have your permission and blessings to write a book about you.</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> About me?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I would like to write a book about you. I have read seven or eight books of yours, and before I came to Sri Lanka I read some of the talks you gave at the United Nations General Assembly when you were Prime Minister.</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> I will give you all my books.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I already have your books, and I have read them all. Only one book I could not get, but my students borrowed it from your library. Now they have returned it, but the other books we were able to buy.</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> No, no, I'm sure you don't have them all.</p>
<p>[/The President then sent someone to bring copies of his books which were not available in the bookstores./]</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Two immortals are inside your heart. One is Mahatma Gandhi and the other is John Kennedy. In your heart you have tremendous compassion, inspired by Gandhi. In your writings you have mentioned many, many times Gandhi's non-violence and tolerance. And also I see that you have been inspired by President Kennedy. Kennedy's dynamism I see in your outer life, and Mahatma Gandhi's compassion and tolerance I see in your inner life.</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> How did you like Ratnapura?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Very much! The Chief Minister was so nice to me in Ratnapura. I was very happy that the Chief Minister received me there. He arranged singing and dancing performances, which my students and I enjoyed tremendously.</p>
<p>[/When the President's aide returned with some of his books which Sri Chinmoy did not yet have, Sri Chinmoy requested President Premadasa to inscribe one book for him./]</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> I asked him to receive you and I am sure that Minister Ranasinghe did everything he could for you?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, I am so grateful.</p>
<p>[/Then President Premadasa showed Sri Chinmoy his own emblem and the emblem of Parliament, explaining the significance of the various parts. Finally, he took Sri Chinmoy to see the room used by the previous Parliament for its sessions. The walls of the corridor were lined with pictures of dignitaries./]</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> So many dignitaries! I am sure you are here.</p>
<p>[/President Premadasa pointed out his own picture./]</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You were Prime Minister at that time?</p>
<p><em>President Premadasa:</em> Yes, I was the Prime Minister then. <em>[President Premadasa led Sri Chinmoy into a room that could seat fifty or sixty people.]</em> When there is something very significant, very important to discuss, this is where we meet.</p>

<p>Dear Sri Chinmoy</p>
