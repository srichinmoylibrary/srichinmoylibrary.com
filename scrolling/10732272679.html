<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not necessary at all. The only thing you should do is to keep the back straight. Some people recline on a chair or slump over, but that is not good. The lotus position is good because it keeps the body quiet. But many people remain in the lotus position for three or four hours and their mind is still roaming, while somebody else may sit on a chair with his mind calm and quiet. The main thing is to keep the back erect and the mind thoughtless.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not at all necessary to have the hands in any special position. Meditation should be done inwardly and devotedly. If you have inner calm and poise, you do not have to worry about your outer position. Let the hands remain wherever they are. The main thing is meditation. When you are meditating, your whole physical, vital and mental existence should be entering into your meditation.</p>
<p>As far as the inner experience is concerned, you can place your hands anywhere. The important thing is to keep them relaxed. You can let them rest on your knees, with the fingers facing downwards, half-closed. Or there are various <em>mudras</em>, with the fingers held in different positions, but these are helpful only for beginners, if they inspire the physical mind to enter into a deeper consciousness. If you want to know more, there is a whole subject called <em>hasta mudra</em>. <em>Hasta</em> means hand; <em>mudra</em> means posture. It deals with the positioning of the fingers and hands.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Our aim is not to become the world’s best athlete. Our aim is to keep the body fit, to develop dynamism and to give the vital innocent joy. In competitive sports, our primary aim should be not to surpass others but constantly to surpass ourselves. In the outer life, when we run with our friends, we are seeing who is actually the best. And we cannot properly evaluate our own capacity unless we have some standard of comparison. But we compete not for the sake of defeating others, but in order to bring forward our own capacity. Our best capacity comes forward only when there are other people around us. They inspire us to bring forward our utmost capacity, and we inspire them to bring forward their utmost capacity. This is why we have competitive sports.</p>
<p>If we can learn to participate in competitive sports devotedly, then we will get real joy and make real spiritual progress. But if we compete egotistically, then we are bound to suffer both inwardly and outwardly. In that case, even if we stand first, we will not obtain blessings from the Supreme, and if we do not stand first we will curse ourselves.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can Pratyahara be practised independently of other sadhanas?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can &lt;em&gt;Pratyahara&lt;/em&gt; be practised independently of other sadhanas?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are eight steps in the spiritual <em>sadhana</em> or discipline: <em>Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana</em> and <em>Samadhi</em>. <em>Yama</em> is self-control and moral abstinence; <em>Niyama</em> is strict observance of conduct and character; <em>Asana</em> is body posture meant to help calm the body and make it a receptive instrument; <em>Pranayama</em> is systematic breathing to calm and help control the mind; <em>Pratyahara</em> is withdrawal from the sense-life; <em>Dharana</em> is fixation of the consciousness on God; <em>Dhyana</em> is meditation; and <em>Samadhi</em> is trance, the absolute union of the individual consciousness with the universal Consciousness.</p>
<p>We do not have to go through all the preliminary stages once we begin to aspire consciously. We do not have to go through the Hatha Yoga <em>asanas</em> and <em>Pranayama</em> in order to enter into meditation. Self-control, withdrawal from the sense life and fixation of the consciousness on God are necessary to some extent before true aspiration can begin. But once aspiration enters into our unillumined human life, our journey has begun. If we have aspiration, we can start with concentration, meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>If you want to practise <em>Pratyahara</em>, withdrawing your outgoing energy and focusing on one particular aspect of your own true being and consciousness, then aspiration is of paramount importance. You do not have to go deliberately through <em>Yama, Niyama, Asana</em> and <em>Pranayama</em>. If you really enter into the field of aspiration, immediately you will try to give up wrong things. You will automatically lead a moral and controlled life. You will stop doing things that are detrimental to your spiritual life. Your inner cry, your aspiration, will compel you to practise the first two steps. And you will find that the third and fourth stages are not necessary. As they say, slow and steady wins the race, and you can go step by step, slowly and steadily. But, at the same time, there is also a path called the sunlit path. All roads lead to the same Goal, but there is one particular road which will lead you there sooner than the other roads. That road is the path of concentration, deep meditation and one-pointed contemplation. One can certainly practise <em>Pratyahara</em> without first practising the other disciplines. And if one also wants to skip <em>Pratyhara</em> and start with <em>Dharana</em> or <em>Dhyana</em>, one can also do that. Many spiritual seekers have done it, and they have been successful in their spiritual journey. But it is up to the individual whether or not he feels the need for any of the particular steps. I have told my disciples that it is not at all necessary to begin before <em>Dhyana</em>. They meditate with me, and they have high, sublime experiences without all the preceding disciplines. But there are other spiritual Masters who ask their students to go through other stages. I have nothing to say against that. Each one has his own way of realising the Truth and offering the Truth to others. If you are sincere enough to follow a spiritual path to the end, and if you have a spiritual Master or if you have friends who are far advanced in the spiritual life, then you can take their help and suggestions on how to make the fastest progress.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part III — Pranayama and yogic breathing</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part III — Pranayama and yogic breathing" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is <em>prana</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> <em>Prana</em> is a Sanskrit word which means breath, life-breath or life-energy. This life-energy is not something material or physical which can be seen by the scientists or doctors, but it is indispensable to life. The source of <em>prana</em> is the Supreme. <em>prana</em> is as important in our life as <em>Atman</em>, which is the soul or Self. Life is breath embodied and breath manifested.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of <em>prana</em>. The first is <em>prana</em> proper, the life energy inside us. Wherever there is life there is <em>prana</em>. The second is <em>apana</em>. This is the energy used specifically in excretion and generation. The third is <em>samana. Samana</em> is located around the navel and is used for digestion and assimilation. The fourth is called <em>vyana</em>. This is located in the lotus of our spiritual heart. There are one hundred and one subtle spiritual nerves around this lotus, and from each of these nerves there branch out one hundred and one other nerves. Each of these, in turn, has seventy-two thousand branches, and through all these nerves <em>vyana</em> moves. These numbers may sound fantastic, but many Seers and Yogis have actually counted them. At the age of twenty-two or twenty-three, I wanted to count these nerves, and I tried. I counted quite a few thousand, and then a luminous being stood in front of me and said, “Don’t waste your time. The Seers are right.”</p>
<p>The last form of <em>prana</em> is <em>udana</em>. <em>Udana</em> is located in the middle of the spine. This <em>prana</em> is most important. If this <em>udana</em> from the middle of the spine goes upward at the time of death, one will go to one of the higher worlds. If it goes downward, one will go to one of the lower worlds. Each place on the body represents a <em>loka</em>, a heavenly world. In India, at the time of death, the relatives and friends always try to observe the area from which the last life-breath of the deceased passes. If the last breath passes from anywhere below the navel, one has to go to lower worlds and suffer greatly. If it passes from somewhere above the navel, one will go to one of the higher worlds to enjoy the Delight of the Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When <em>prana</em> becomes one with the Cosmic Will, immediately we see a great achievement in our inner life. That achievement may come to us in the form of Peace, in the form of Joy or in the form of Fulfilment. If we can become conscious of our breathing when we meditate, it will help us to become conscious of the great Divine Breath of which we are the instruments. When we start to meditate, if the flow of <em>prana</em> is spontaneous, steady and unobstructed, then the inner being is in a position to bring forward the inner wealth and make the outer personality feel, realise and fulfil the Highest. In order to get the most out of <em>prana</em>, we have to be fully, unreservedly and totally pure in our outer and inner life. Then, when <em>prana</em>, the life-force, is used in the service of the Supreme, we become the greatest pride of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak a little about the secret of yogic breathing or Pranayama?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak a little about the secret of yogic breathing or &lt;em&gt;Pranayama&lt;/em&gt;?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We have three major Yogas according to our Hindu spiritual philosophy: <em>Jnana Yoga</em>, <em>Karma Yoga</em> and <em>Bhakti Yoga</em>; the path of knowledge, the path of action and the path of devotion. In <em>Jnana Yoga</em>, the path of knowledge, there is a branch which is called <em>Raja Yoga</em>. <em>Raja</em> means ‘king’. This branch is called the royal Yoga. In <em>Raja Yoga</em> there are eight steps or stages in the seeker’s Godward journey, and the fourth is called <em>pranayama</em>. It is the Yoga of systematic breathing, of controlled breath. We all breathe, but most of us do not know how to breathe properly. Yet if we can breathe correctly, we can free ourselves from disease and ultimately we can even defy death.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of breath: one is <em>prana</em> and the other is <em>apana</em>. When we breathe in cosmic energy to purify and energise our life, we call it <em>prana</em>. When we breathe out our impurities, it is called <em>apana</em>. When we breathe in <em>prana</em>, we conquer disease, and when we breathe out <em>apana</em>, we put in perfect condition the physical organs that are not functioning well; that is to say, we put the entire body in perfect order. Here is a simple exercise which you can do at any time. While you are walking, for five steps breathe in and for five steps breathe out very regularly. If you do this for only two blocks, you will feel refreshed.</p>
<p>There are three steps in proper, systematic breathing. The first is <em>puraka</em>, or inhalation; the second is <em>kumbhaka</em>, or retention; the third is <em>rechaka</em>, or exhalation. When you breathe in, you have to feel that you are breathing in the Breath of God, the Supreme, the divine Beloved. When you hold the breath, you must feel that you are holding the all-fulfilling Breath of the Supreme. And when you breathe out, you have to feel that you are offering God’s immortal Life-breath or energy to His entire creation.</p>
<p>To practise systematic breathing, when you are breathing in, just utter the word <em>puraka</em> mentally or silently. Then, while you are holding the breath, silently utter <em>kumbhaka</em>. And when you breathe out, silently utter the word <em>rechaka</em>. Or you can repeat the name of God as you breathe in, while you retain the breath, and again as you breathe out. Use the name you use when you pray to God — <em>Supreme, God, Aum</em>, whatever name pleases you most. When you are in trouble or in danger, immediately you utter somebody’s name, because you feel that he is the one who is going to save you. While you are breathing, you also have to feel that the one who comes first and foremost in your life should be invoked.</p>
<p>The rhythm of your breathing is most important. If you breathe in for one second or for one repetition of the name of the Supreme, then you should hold the breath for four seconds or four repetitions. Then, when you breathe out, it should be for two seconds or the time it takes you to repeat the name of the Supreme twice. The breathing should be done softly and silently. When you breathe in and out, you should do it so gently that, even if there were a thread right in front of your nose, your breathing would not move it.</p>
<p>In normal breathing both of our nostrils are usually functioning. But when we breathe properly through alternate nostrils, we get immediate relief from mental anxiety, worries, depression and many other things that cause disturbances in our nature. Alternate nostril breathing is a most important breathing exercise. We start by using our right thumb to close our right nostril. Next we breathe in with the left nostril, silently repeating the name of God, Supreme or <em>puraka</em>, just once. Then we close the left nostril with the fourth finger of the right hand, and with both nostrils closed, silently repeat the name of God, Supreme or <em>kumbhaka</em> four times while holding the breath. Finally we lift the thumb from the right nostril, still keeping the left nostril closed, and exhale, repeating God, Supreme or <em>rechaka</em> twice.</p>
<p>After some time, we can gradually increase the number. Instead of this short one-four-two breath, we can practise a four-sixteen-eight count breath. Some of the Indian Yogis do this exercise for hours, but it should be done comfortably and without force or strain.</p>
<p>But if we overdo this exercise, we will get heart disease. That is why <em>Pranayama</em> has to be taught by one who has practised under a great spiritual figure. If you do it by yourself, instead of reaping the benefits, you may ruin your health. So the best thing is to start with the one-four-two technique. Three times a day you may do it — early in the morning, at noon and at evening — and you will feel how much you will be able to increase it with time.</p>
<p>While we are breathing this way, our thoughts should be very, very pure. If an impure thought enters into us while we are breathing in, it is like bringing in poison. If limitation, ego, or any thought which will eventually bind us enters into the breath, then it is poison which is entering. If we can practise this exercise soulfully three or four times daily, the benefits will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>This <em>Pranayama</em> defies time and space. If we are really successful in doing this, we can easily conquer disease and obtain spiritual power. Right now I am here, but if I think of my mother, father or friends who are far away, and if I am successful in this breathing technique, I can enter into anyone’s consciousness and obtain full information about what he is thinking. If you have a violent headache or some other ailment, this alternate breathing will help in many ways to improve your condition. If you are afraid of doing something which is good, if you are afraid of speaking to someone, do two or three minutes of <em>Pranayama</em> and you will be able to do it. If you are angry with someone and want to conquer your anger, then at that moment, right where you are sitting or standing, practise alternate breathing and your anger will disappear.</p>
<p>You may feel that it is impossible to live without breathing for more than a few minutes. But if you practise this exercise you will be able to remain even for a few hours without breathing. It is not only possible: it is inevitable. This is my own personal experience. I started learning this technique twenty years ago and, whether you want to believe me or not, I wish to tell you that for two and a half hours at a time I have been able to stop my own breathing. I used to go in the evening to a park near my home to meditate, and I did this. So if I can do it, you can also do it if you wish to.</p>
<p>Most of you have heard about Kundalini. This is the most sacred Yoga. Inside our spine in our subtle physical body, we have three currents. They are called <em>Ida, Pingala</em> and <em>Sushumna</em>. <em>Pingala</em> has a connection with the sun, <em>Ida</em> with the moon, and <em>Sushumna</em> with the Highest. We have six spiritual centres in the spine, connected by these three currents. If we can open these centres we can become the possessors of infinite Peace, Light and Power. One other centre, which we call <em>Sahasrara</em>, the thousand-petaled lotus, is located in the cerebrum and is not counted with the other six. The other centres are <em>Muladhara</em> at the base of the spine, <em>Svadisthana</em> at the spleen, <em>Manipura</em> at the navel, <em>Anahata</em> at the heart, <em>Vishuddha</em> at the throat and <em>Ajna</em> in the forehead. We can open these centres with the power of our concentration, or with spiritual alternate breathing.</p>
<p>It need not take years to get liberation; it can be a matter of months. One can get Self-realisation within six months, eight months, or a year if he has the capacity to control his breath and focus all his attention on each of the six spiritual centres. This is not a theoretical idea of mine. There have been a great many Indian spiritual aspirants who have attained this elevation by practising <em>Pranayama</em> for seven or eight months. But it has to be done with utmost faith and utmost dedication. The aspirant must have perfect mastery over all the senses and over the mind. If one can practise this <em>Pranayama</em> sincerely and devotedly, then Self-realisation is within the reach of everybody in this meditation room in this very lifetime.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is a most effective path for opening the third eye, but it is not absolutely essential. If you can bring the inner being forward, or if the Supreme’s Grace descends, or if your concentration and will power are most intense, then you can open your third eye without the breathing exercise. Breathing is one of the most effective methods, but you cannot say it is absolutely essential.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly it can be restored. Many times it has happened in India that some aspirant in his spiritual search began the awakening of the Kundalini. Then, because his aspiration was not firm enough to continue the process, the Kundalini began sleeping again.</p>
<p>Kundalini is the secret of secrets in all Yogas. Kundalini is in everybody, asleep in the base of the spine. With our aspiration and concentration, this Kundalini can be awakened. There are various ways to awaken the Kundalini. Earlier I mentioned <em>Pranayama</em>. Also, if the spiritually realised Guru wishes to, and if it is the Will of the Supreme, just by a mere touch or a look, the Guru can awaken it. During a dream, the Divine or the Guru can awaken the Kundalini.</p>
<p>A singer or a musician can awaken the Kundalini and open his chakras when he is deeply absorbed in his singing or playing. Beethoven had this experience many, many times. Although he was not a spiritual figure, in his music he experienced the awakening of the Kundalini many times. In India there are many singers and dancers who get the experience of Kundalini in their highest and deepest concentration on their performance. There are various ways one can have this experience. If it started once and then stopped, one can rest assured it will come back again with the proper methods.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the role of Pranayama in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the role of &lt;em&gt;Pranayama&lt;/em&gt; in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the spiritual life the role of <em>Pranayama</em> depends on the individual. There are many who do not go through breathing exercises before meditation. Instead they invoke God’s Light and Presence. They feel that by invoking divine Grace, Protection, Peace and Light they can change their nature and purify their life as effectively as they could by doing <em>Pranayama</em>.</p>
<p>If one wants to follow the Yoga of dedicated service, the Yoga of love, devotion and surrender, the Yoga of inner wisdom, or if one wants to bring the psychic being to the fore and let the psychic in him, the divine child in him, guide him and take him to God, then that particular aspirant need not give much importance to <em>prana</em>. He has to give all importance to the highest Peace, Bliss and Power that he wants to bring down from above. When the Peace, Bliss and Power enter into him, they automatically bring in the infinite life-breath which transforms the finite, limited life-breath that he already holds. So he need not practise systematic inhalation, retention and exhalation. The Light that he brings into his system will regulate his breath, his life-energy, according to the divine necessity in that particular aspirant.</p>
<p>The only breathing exercise a spiritual aspirant really needs is to try to breathe in purity. While breathing in, if he consciously imagines and feels that he is breathing in Perfection from above, then the limitations inside his system are automatically transformed. The moment we breathe in consciously, the <em>prana</em> inside us has more value. But to go through many vigorous exercises is not at all necessary for God-realisation. If we can breathe in slowly and deeply, and have a devoted feeling toward the Supreme and toward humanity while breathing, we will be able to enter into the world with our divinised breath. When we breathe in with a feeling of spontaneous devotion, we can serve the Supreme as well as humanity spiritually and materially.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have been given to understand that in normal breathing we breathe in through both nostrils and then the energy goes down one side of the spine for two hours and then it goes down the other side for two hours; but that when we do alternate breathing, this changes. Is it true?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have been given to understand that in normal breathing we breathe in through both nostrils and then the energy goes down one side of the spine for two hours and then it goes down the other side for two hours; but that when we do alternate breathing, this changes. Is it true?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not true. The only thing that happens during normal breathing, when both nostrils are functioning, is that life energy goes up and down the spine. Spiritual figures are conscious of this; ordinary people are not. <em>Prana</em> goes upward to give realisation and downward for transformation. When <em>prana</em> goes up and passes through the <em>Sahasrara</em> chakra, it touches the Highest, like a link between Heaven and earth. When it goes down, it helps us keep a firm hold on matter, on the physical world. What actually happens during alternate breathing is that you put concentrated energy into your breathing in order to purify and divinely activate your system.</p>
<p>Twelve to fifteen breaths per minute is normal for most human beings, but there are people who breathe only three or four times a minute as a result of their practice of alternate breathing. The turtle is the symbol of Immortality. It breathes about three times per minute. That is why a turtle lives for hundreds of years while we live for only fifty, sixty or seventy years.</p>
<p>This technique of breathing gives success in all walks of life. It immediately takes us to the inner world and identifies us with the essence of our existence. From the soul we are reaching the Source, and when we are in the Source all is success and fulfilment.</p>
<p>For anything that you want to do, you will do better if you can hold your breath comfortably for a longer period. I happened to be a good sportsman in the hundred metre race. It is said that if you want to run a distance of a hundred metres, you should breathe in once and then cover the entire distance without breathing again. If you breathe in three or four times while you are running, you will be lost. Sometimes I could not do it in one breath and I had to take a second breath. Although I held the first prize for twelve years, I know I would have done far better if I could have done it always in one breath. Anything that you want to do, you will do better if you breathe in properly and hold your breath. But this should be done comfortably, without straining the lungs. While we are breathing ordinarily during the day, not even three or four times do we utilise our lungs so that they work to their full capacity. But proper breathing is very important. You know we are living in a world of economy. We always try to economise. If we can learn alternate breathing, then we are economising. And we get immediate success if we can do alternate breathing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Could you speak about the different aspects of the Divine that can be invoked when one breathes through the left and right nostrils?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Could you speak about the different aspects of the Divine that can be invoked when one breathes through the left and right nostrils?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> All of you are breathing in and out. Please try to observe whether you are breathing primarily through your left nostril or through your right nostril. Those of you who are breathing in through the left nostril, please repeat the word <em>moon</em>, and those who are breathing through the right, please repeat the word <em>sun</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to change your fate, there is a most significant and most effective method of doing this. During the day or night, when you observe that your left nostril is functioning and not your right, then try to concentrate or meditate on the moon for a few minutes. You will get the moon’s qualities: peace, serenity and subtle bliss. When you observe that the right nostril is functioning, then concentrate on the sun. You are bound to get the qualities of the sun: dynamism and divine power. But if you misuse this power, if you do not aspire for dynamic and energising power, then it becomes aggression; and if you misuse this peace or subtle bliss, then immediately inertia, lethargy and idleness will attack you and try to take full control of your life. When you feel inert, when you do not feel like doing anything, if you observe, you will see that it is the left nostril that is functioning. But when you are energetic, when you want to do something, at that time it is the right one.</p>
<p>When you do heavy exercise, you will see that both nostrils are functioning equally, At that time, it is <em>Sushumna</em>, the main cord, that is functioning. When both the nostrils are functioning, at that time divine Peace and divine Power are functioning simultaneously in you. But you have to be conscious of them and invoke them more and more. Every day you are breathing. Try to observe your breath in your day-to-day activities. Even if you can spend five minutes out of each hour being conscious of your breathing, that will be wonderful. Daily if you use the breath properly, you can bring in more power and peace to illumine your Ignorance.</p>
<p>During your deepest meditation, you need not think of breath at all. You should not think about whether you are breathing in with your left or right nostril, or if both nostrils are functioning. It is not at all necessary. The soul at that time is consciously taking care of you and is in full charge of your breathing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, it is not necessary for them to meet together. The main thing is to follow the incoming breath. With this breath you can energise your body, vital, mind, heart and soul. And with the outgoing breath you can purify your body, vital, mind and heart.</p>
<p>But if you want to unite the incoming breath and outgoing breath, you have to take your aspiration beyond the body, above the body. If you can take the last breath to the <em>Sahasrara</em> centre, at the top of the head, then the outgoing breath will flow through it, and the incoming breath which comes from God, from the Supreme, can meet it at this point.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time what you should do is to breathe in as slowly and quietly as possible and feel that around you and before you there is flowing a river of energy. If you see and feel this river of energy, try to bring it into your system. When the river of energy enters into you, your breath will flow continuously and spontaneously, without disturbing your meditation.</p>
