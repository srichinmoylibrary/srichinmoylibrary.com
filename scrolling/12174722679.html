<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In my New Year's message this year, I have given the message of newness. God has taken many, many years to create this newness; He has taken many, many years to create this particular year.</p>
<p>There is going to be no more destructive dance. There will be no third world war. Already one superpower has gone. One superpower still exists, but this superpower can only mediate in little, little countries and little villages. That is because the United Nations — or you can call it the heart-power of the world — is becoming infinitely, infinitely more powerful than the mind-power.</p>
<p>For centuries the mind-power has dominated. But the time is coming, not only in the outer or political world but also in the inner world of my disciples, when the mind-power will surrender. At one time the mind-power was very rebellious, but now the mind-power is surrendering to the heart-power.</p>
<p>Brightness and luminosity have already started blossoming. Every day and every hour this brightness and this luminosity are going to increase inside our hearts. And, by virtue of our own aspiration, from our hearts we will be able to offer these qualities to the world at large.</p>
<p>Now it has become extremely clear to me that the spiritual life is going only in one direction; there is not going to be any U-turn. Before we used to go slowly, cautiously and hesitantly. But now I am seeing clearly that our life-boat is sailing confidently towards the destination. We no longer have to go cautiously and carefully. We can go as fast as we want to provided we feel the necessity of reaching our destination as soon as possible so we can embark on a new life and a new journey. There is no end to our journey and no end to our destination.</p>
<p>Previously this new life used to beg us or try to force us to come to it. Now we have surrendered to the new life and it is carrying us to our ever-transcending destination. From now on we will only see the song and dance of the divine forces. The undivine forces are exhausted. They have already started surrendering to the divine forces, and they are ready to abide by the will of the divine forces.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we get extra energy?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we get extra energy?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can get extra energy from many things, but the easiest way is to get it from the fleeting moment. The mind tells you that there are sixty minutes to the hour. But forget what the mind says. Instead of saying that one hour houses sixty minutes, feel that one minute houses an hour. Think that inside each minute there are many, many hours.</p>
<p>When you go to bed, feel that you are going to take rest for at least ten or twenty hours. Even if you are only getting a half hour's rest, think of it as ten hours. As soon as you think of ten hours, Eternity comes to mind. But if you think that it is now two o'clock in the morning and your alarm will go off at five o'clock or six o'clock, then you are doomed.</p>
<p>A child may think that he does not have the capacity to lift up a heavy weight, but the mother knows that the child has the capacity. She only has to convince the child. Similarly, you have to convince the mind that it has the capacity to embody the amount of rest that the physical needs. You are not fooling the mind, but only illumining it and making it feel how much of the reality it is capable of holding.</p>
<p>If every time you take rest you feel that you will be resting for ten or twelve hours, then immediately the mental pressure will go away. When the pressure goes away from the mind, the mind is relaxed and expanded. Expansion means receptivity. And if receptivity is there, you will not be tired when you get up. Tiredness remains in the body only when our receptivity is very limited. If the receptivity is there, in five minutes you can draw the unlimited energy you need from the cosmos.</p>
<p>So you can get unlimited receptivity by using wisdom instead of ordinary intelligence. Wisdom lets us see the infinite inside the finite. It is very easy to see the finite inside the infinite. But we have to know that the infinite is also inside the finite. Krishna, Buddha, Christ, Ramakrishna and other great spiritual figures all had physical bodies. But inside their bodies was something infinite. Their finite frame held the infinite. Similarly, the ocean is made up of countless drops, but each drop embodies the vast ocean. We cannot separate the drops from the ocean, the finite from the infinite. They are inseparable.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every year we go to a different place, where we give and take. We give the people in the countries we visit our aspiration and they give us their realisations. The experiences that the heart and the soul of Viet Nam have taken centuries to accumulate and all the things that they have taken years and years to realise, we get in a few weeks' time. It is like parents who take a long time to build a house, and then their children use the house.</p>
<p>So we come to give something and to learn something. We give them what we have and what we are and we learn from them what they have to offer.</p>

<p>Ho Chi Minh, I bow to you. You are the father of the nation, the liberator of the nation and the highest dreamer of the nation. Your mind's wisdom and your heart's compassion will forever shine through the heart of each and every Vietnamese.</p>
<p>You had something that is so rare in human beings: you saw and felt that each human being has something good in him. Most people find it extremely difficult to see any good qualities in their enemies. Once we consider someone our enemy, we do not see anything good in him. But you had that rare wisdom which allowed you to see good qualities even in your worst enemies.</p>
<p>After you had liberated your country and made it independent, you took light from the American Declaration of Independence, which was the vision of President Jefferson.</p>
<p>The French tried to dominate your country and you fought so hard against them; finally you threw them out of your beloved country. But at the time of your inauguration, you took inspiration from their message on the Rights of Man. No human being on earth will be able to do what you did for mankind.</p>
<p>I come from India; I am a son of Mother India. Here in Viet Nam I feel very strongly the presence of Mother India. Simplicity of life and purity of heart are two most significant qualities that a country can have. These two divine qualities give me utmost joy, for I am a seeker of truth and a lover of peace. In India I feel these qualities and also I feel them here.</p>
<p>I am extremely, extremely grateful to the authorities here for allowing my name to be closely connected with your achievements and with your vision of tomorrow's progress, When we live in the mind, we quarrel and fight. But when we live in the heart, we only love, for we feel that we all belong to one world-family. If we can live in our hearts, there will be peace within us and harmony in the world. Then we will have accomplished everything.</p>
<p>Here we are offering our dedicated service to Viet Nam and praying to God to bless us with peace. Peace can be found in our inner existence. It is not something that we can see; it is something that we can only feel and grow into. An American general, in a different context, once said about your soldiers: their presence was always felt, but they were not to be found. Peace is like that, too.</p>
<p>Viet Nam, you have suffered. Your suffering knew no bounds. Again, it is you who will be able to offer joy and happiness to the world. You are the chosen country, for the country that has suffered the most is the right country to offer joy to mankind. After the darkest night, we see the beauty and light of day.</p>
<p>Viet Nam, we love you and adore you because you are a true believer, lover and promoter of world peace.</p>
