<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Learning a musical instrument is important for those who have musical talent, but not for others. If you have musical talent, then it will help you. But if you don't have a musical ear, then an instrument is absolutely unnecessary. If you don't have the capacity, but want to study because your friends play, or to show off, then there is no necessity in it.</p>
<p>There is only one necessity and that is your daily soulful meditation. If you do that, you will be able to realise God. You may spend your time in music for years and years, but without meditation you will not be able to realise God. If you have a talent, it is advisable to use it. But if you don't have the talent, then don't waste your precious time, which you could be using for a higher, divine purpose. You should just continue with your meditation, which is your inner music.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While playing a musical instrument, you have to feel that music has and is the key to unlock the Heart-Door of the Supreme. It is only music that has a free access to the Heart-Door of the Supreme. If you can feel that, then the musician in you will be able to manifest the highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual essence of Beethoven's sound-creation-manifestation is that the outer life can be harmonised, liberated and fulfilled by the soul's conscious guidance of the physical in us. Even if the outer life starts from the darkest ignorance, it has hope. It begins its journey with hope; but eventually its total transformation, illumination and perfection become certain.</p>
<p>When Beethoven's music starts, it gives the feeling of a mad elephant, first striking this side, then that side. We can imagine it striking one wall, then moving to the other side and striking another wall; but it is moving, moving — constant movement. Then after getting a few blows, after breaking heads here and there, the movement goes toward the goal. Whether we call it soulful movement, vital movement or something else, it eventually reaches the goal.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is dancing to soulful music a form of meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is dancing to soulful music a form of meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the music is soulful and the dancing is also soulful, then it can be a form of meditation. Anything that is soulful is a form of meditation, but we have to know that there are degrees of soulfulness. Talking to someone soulfully is a form of meditation. Dancing soulfully to soulful music is a form of meditation. Soulfully reading spiritual books is a form of meditation. Sitting alone in your room concentrating and elevating your consciousness to a very high, deep and sublime plane is also a form of meditation.</p>
<p>We have to know the difference between the highest meditation and ordinary meditation. Naturally, meditating most soulfully in front of a shrine is of infinitely greater importance than dancing soulfully to soulful music. Very often there are difficulties with dancing. The dancing may be soulful, but the audience may be absolutely undivine, impure and vulgar. No matter how pure one is, the undivine consciousness of the audience will lower one's consciousness. There are many dancers in India who have come from very religious, respectable families and when they first started dancing, they were pure and spiritual. But the eyes of the people in the audience were not pure. Naturally, the audience's consciousness was thrust upon the young dancers, and they lost their spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p>In a spiritual community, dancers may safely perform soulful dancing because everybody there prays and meditates and it is not open to the public. The community is only for seekers who are under spiritual guidance and who are expected to lead a higher life. If the dancers also pray and meditate, they are like members of the same spiritual family. Since the audience and the dancers have the same divine consciousness, there can be no problem.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Could you please tell us the spiritual significance of your chanting?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I have chanted a few Sanskrit verses which I set to music. These verses were composed by the Vedic and Upanishadic seers. The Vedic seers had opened their Third Eye, the Eye that sees the Real. With our earthly physical eyes we do not see the Real. The ultimate Real can be seen only with the Third Eye, the Eye of Vision.</p>
<p>If one consciously accepts the spiritual life, the inner life, then naturally one will aspire and meditate; one will always try to elevate one's consciousness to the highest. When we chant, our psychic being, which is the representative of the soul, is fed. A mother feeds her child whenever the child is hungry. Similarly, we have to feed the soul, the divine child within us, by chanting or meditating. When the soul is constantly fed, it comes to the fore and the soul-bird gets the opportunity to fly in the sky of Infinity and Eternity.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you sing, please try to sing soulfully as well as powerfully, not just powerfully. Do not put too much force into the song without also using the soul. Otherwise, you will only have the body but not the soul. When you use power, it is the body. When you sing soulfully, you come to know that the soul is manifesting itself through the body. So some of the body is needed, but not to the exclusion of the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you are going to listen to records or tapes, it is always better if you listen to my voice rather than to others' voices. Otherwise, you may listen to other persons' singing and immediately your jealousy will start. But if you hear my voice, it will give you inspiration and aspiration. I am not joking. Somebody does something very well, but just because it is he or she that has done it, you can't appreciate it. Since you can't appreciate it, your aspiration will not go high.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> This is very bad. I admire your confession, but I wish to say that the Invocation is most important. With your meditation, you have not reached the goal. You have not touched the tape. You feel that you have come very near the goal, but unless you touch the tape, you have not completed the race. If you don't touch the goal, then it is as good as not starting. You have left the starting block and covered 80 or 90 metres, but if you don't finish, then it is all useless.</p>
<p>Many times while singing the Supreme, people think of the most absurd things. Apart from vital and emotional thoughts, they think of what they are going to eat and all kinds of absurd things. Everybody does it. This is very bad. Please feel that the Invocation is something most significant and most important in your spiritual life, and take it seriously.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I don't call them poems; they are songs, only I don't compose the tune at that time. Then, when I set the tune, sometimes I get the tune before I actually place my fingers on the harmonium. It is absolutely fixed from the beginning to the end. Sometimes a tune comes spontaneously. At that time, my mind will be able to see the first half, but the mind does not know what the ending will be. Sometimes, after I have completed the song, I feel that one key has disappointed me. While I am singing the first line, it is very soulful. Then, when I complete the song and play it again, I can't believe that I composed it. It is offensive to my ears. I feel sorry, and I try to fix it. I try and try, but most of the time I fail.</p>
<p>When I am walking along the street or sitting in my room, I may get a beautiful tune, but when I sit with my notebook in front of my harmonium, at that time I don't get that tune. Sometimes it takes me time. When inspiration is not there I don't get the proper key. It is a real struggle. It is absolutely torture. The human mind is being tortured by the human greed in me. I have to finish. Where is aspiration? It is all desire. But it does not happen quite often. On very, very rare occasions this happens. Usually there is real inspiration; otherwise, I could not have done so many songs. Since I left for Australia, I have written 372 songs. Now, I am setting tunes to them. So about four hundred songs I have got this year already [April 1976]. That is why I am confident enough to say that this year I will be able to compose one thousand songs.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. From my music they get a force. I haven't done anything outwardly in the music world, but they are receiving something from my music; and what they receive they are manifesting in their own music. My music is for the very limited, the few disciples who will appreciate everything I do just because it is I who have done it. I don't play one piece of music correctly; all the notes are wrong. When actual musicians appreciate my music, it is because they truly love me. They do not only hear my music; they also feel my presence in it.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When I sing, I do two things. First of all, I try to bring down universal harmony and bliss into the aspirants, especially into the disciples who are in tune with the cosmic Joy. Next, I try to uplift the limited consciousness of each disciple into the limitless Consciousness.</p>
<p>The spiritual songs that I sing are prayers to the Supreme to ferry us across the ocean of darkness and ignorance to the ocean of Delight and Immortality. The Supreme is the Boatman and we pray to Him to ferry us to the Golden Shore. Singing immediately inspires us and awakens the slumbering soul in us. If we sing a divine song, a soulful song, it immediately brings purity into our system. Singing purifies our limited consciousness and brings to us universal Harmony. In our day-to-day life, we constantly break the universal Harmony, but when we sing, we build and create this universal Harmony in and around us.</p>
<p>If we can sing, we can have the purest consciousness and perfect harmony in our nature. Nothing delights our soul more than soulful singing. Please sing at home; at home you can sing loudly. Sing in the street or at any other place. Of course in the street you will sing inwardly; otherwise, people will laugh at you.</p>
<p>The Supreme blesses those who both inwardly and outwardly sing soulful songs. Some people do not have a beautiful singing voice at all, but their voice is deeply appreciated by the Supreme because they sing soulfully. The Supreme does not care for someone who is a very great singer but who sings without any aspiration or devotion. He cares only for the ones who sing soulfully.</p>
<p>I wish all who have consciously become my devoted disciples to sing "The Supreme" once any time during the day. It takes only three minutes, and these three minutes pass away in the twinkling of an eye. But it will help your inner life significantly.</p>
<p>Each soulful song leads us to the Highest because it is the purest flower that can be offered at the Feet of God. When we sing, our whole existence actually becomes a garland of flowers ready to be offered at the Feet of the Supreme. This is why I sing.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: As disciples, should we play only soulful music when we play an instrument?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: As disciples, should we play only soulful music when we play an instrument?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the disciple. If he is a first-class disciple and wants to play music, then naturally he will play soulful music only, for if he plays lower vital music, he will fall down from the top of the mango tree. With greatest difficulty he has climbed up the mango tree and now he is so happy that he is on the topmost branch. But if temptation comes and he falls down and breaks his leg, then it will take him quite a few years to climb up again. Because he was a first-class disciple, he was able to climb up the tree; but when temptation began, he fell down and became a seventh-class disciple. For a seventh-class disciple to climb up the tree again is almost impossible.</p>
<p>If you drink nectar ten times and then drink poison only once, you will die. You can drink nectar as many times as you want to, but if you drink poison even once, you won't be able to nullify its effect. You have to feel like this: you can take sugar seven times, but if you take salt only once, it will ruin the taste of sugar. You will immediately feel the effect of the salt.</p>
<p>It is always advisable to play only soulful music. Again, there are grades and degrees of soulfulness. You should try to play the most soulful music, but if you cannot, you should try to play the next most soulful music.</p>
<p>You have to know that if you play music from the vital plane, you are only fooling yourself. The music that is inspired from around or below the navel is the vital music. Music that comes from the heart is psychic music and the music that comes from the inmost recesses of the heart, from very deep within, comes from the soul. If we can feel that it is not our voice, not our fingers, but some reality deep inside our heart which is expressing itself, then we will know that it is the soul's music.</p>
