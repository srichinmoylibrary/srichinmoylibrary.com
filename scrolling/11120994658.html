<p>In this life there will be a few things that the 1,000-mile runners will never be able to forget. This 1,000-mile race is one of them.</p>
<p>The runners will feel sad today that the race is over and that they are not on the course running. The handlers will feel happy.</p>
<p>We do not have much money-power, but we have heart-power. Other organisations may have so much money and thousands of people. But money-power does not work and man-power does not work. It is with our heart-power that we put on the 1,000-mile race.</p>

<p>I was running near my one-mile mark by Main Street, wearing a Madal Bal T-shirt. God knows what it says on the back. A man with a little umbrella came up to me and said, "Are you a member of the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team?"</p>
<p>I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>He said that he had read about the 1,000-mile race in the newspaper. Then he said, "Oh, how I would love to meet Sri Chinmoy!"</p>
<p>Then I said, "I am Sri Chinmoy."</p>
<p>He dropped his umbrella.</p>

<p>This morning we had our Father's Day Marathon. The faces of two runners were worth seeing. Satyajit's face was by far the best. Then came Saurjya's face. These two are such good friends. Satyaiit had such concentration that he looked like he was going to attack somebody.</p>

<p>This morning I left my house at quarter to six in the morning to run to Flushing Meadow Park. At an intersection I was standing on the sidewalk waiting for a car to pass. But when the car came up to me, it just stopped.</p>
<p>A young man and a few girls were in the car. The young man said to me, "Good morning, Sri Chinmoy. You should always go first!"</p>
<p>Then he signalled for me to cross in front of him. I smiled at him and he smiled at me. Then I crossed the street.</p>

<p>The other day I got thirsty while I was out running. So I stopped at a small restaurant and asked for a drink of water. But the man working there said, "No, you have to bring your own cup or a glass." He was so unkind!</p>
<p>So I went somewhere and bought a paper cup. Then the man at the first store gave me some water.</p>

<p>When I see Snehashila running at our races, sometimes the monkey in me wants to laugh at her style. At every moment she seems to be taking her last agonised breath.</p>
<p>Then wisdom dawns. She is running, whereas I am seated in my chair just watching. I have to succeed in admiring her!</p>

<p>This afternoon I went out walking. As I was coming back, I saw an older lady mowing her lawn. The lawn was on a small hill that came down to the sidewalk. She must have accidentally pulled out the electric plug to her lawnmower and let go, because suddenly it started rolling down the hill towards the street. The lady was standing there screaming, "Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p>
<p>Nowadays I am unable to run at all, but when I saw the lawnmower rolling towards the street, I came running over to grab it. I was afraid it might hit a car and cause an accident.</p>
<p>The lady was holding her hand on her heart. "Oh, thank you, thank you! You are such a nice man," she said.</p>
<p>But her friend, who was standing next to her on the lawn, said, "Why do you have to thank him? It was his duty!"</p>

<p>Two times I saw Mohan and Anjali running together. The first time, at three or four miles, they were laughing and laughing. I was screaming at them, but they were in the seventh Heaven of delight, and they did not notice me.</p>
<p>After eight or nine miles, the course became very narrow and everybody had to go to one side of the street. At that time I saw them and they also saw me.</p>

<p>While I was watching the New York City Marathon from the sidewalk, many times I raised my hand when I saw disciples running.</p>
<p>Four or five times other people hit my hand with their hand as they were running by. They hit me so hard!</p>
<p>One or two recognised me, and while touching me said, "Sri Chinmoy!" But some just gave me a slap.</p>

<p>After the marathon, one runner was making a phone call. I heard everything he said because I was standing behind him, waiting to use the phone. The runner had a bandage around his right quadricep. He was begging his brother to come and pick him up. God knows what the brother said.</p>
<p>Then the man called someone else, whom he called "Honey." But this person also did not want to come.</p>
<p>Then he called "Mum." But Mum also said no. She was the third person to refuse him. Then he said such a nasty word to his mother over the phone.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I saw him cross the street to get the bus. Poor fellow, once he had to cross the street to make the phone calls, and again he had to cross to go to the bus stop.</p>

<p>While some of the slower runners were still running, the organisers started taking down the equipment.</p>
<p>Many years ago I had that experience when I was running the New York City Marathon. What an insult! The first insult was not enough — that Chameli went ahead of me! Then came the second insult: I saw the police taking down the wooden barricades while I was still running.</p>
