<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, it is not advisable. Everybody can pray in the morning to the Supreme, "Let Thy Will be done." That is a true prayer. But in the actual incidents that take place during the day, the desiring vital is asking one thing and the aspiring heart is asking something else. We see that our individual will does not surrender because of its own desiring qualities. But the aspiring heart will naturally want to be on the side of the Supreme's Will. Consciously and devotedly, if we take the side of the aspiring heart, then our individual will surrenders to the Will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>If you remember a time during the past fifteen or sixteen days, when you surrendered your will to the Will of the Supreme, then you should concentrate on that particular incident. It can inspire you to again offer your own individual will to the Will of the Supreme.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How does karma affect surrender?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How does karma affect surrender?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How your karma affects your surrender entirely depends on what kind of action you do. If it is divine action, then automatically surrender comes. We cannot separate a divine action from surrender itself. Now there is a difference between divine action and so-called good action. When you don't tell lies, when you don't scold, insult or strike anybody, that is a good action. But divine action is all the time to hear the inner voice. You cannot perform any divine action without hearing the dictates of the soul. First you hear the message from within and then you act. That is called divine action. And when you constantly do the divine action it is called surrender.</p>
<p>So-called good action you have heard about from your parents, from your friends, from everyone. But if you do good action it all becomes something moral; the mind is telling you how to act. You have got some idea such as, "Don't tell a lie." All right, you don't tell a lie; but even if you remain absolutely honest, even if you become the most honest person on earth, your honesty cannot take you to God. Honesty is also necessary, but just by becoming a sincere person one cannot reach the goal. For that one has to become divine. Who is a divine person? You are a divine person provided you hear the message that you get from within, and you listen to that message. When you listen to the message, your karma is bound to be divine. Your action itself is your surrender because you listen to someone within you who knows everything and who is everything.</p>
<p>If we can perform a divine action, it automatically helps our surrender; that divine action is surrender itself. But what if we just perform mental action or action that is to be done out of duty? It is your bounden duty to help your family. But are you constantly getting the message from your soul to say this thing to your son, that thing to your wife and something else to your daughter? If you don't get the inner message and you just offer your wisdom because you are the head of the family, you have every right to do so; but you do not know how many times you may be giving false and wrong advice. Your mind will say that it is the absolutely correct advice. But I wish to tell you that if it does not come from the soul, your advice can be totally wrong. Even the highest advice from your mind can be all false. Your false advice will definitely affect not only you, but your dear ones also. But if your advice comes from your heart, then even if your dear ones misunderstand you or do not listen to you at all, I tell you that your action is nevertheless bound to produce surrender in your own life. You have played your role. Now if your daughter does not listen, it is not your fault. You have said something which has come directly from God, from the Inner Pilot. God Himself will be responsible if your daughter does not listen because the message has come from Him. You have merely executed His Will; you are His instrument. But if the message does not come from God within you, then your action can be totally wrong and your karma will be wrong. So I always say that parents or elder members in the family have every right to tell the children what to do and what not to do. But they have to know whether their advice is coming directly from their soul or from the so-called information that they have acquired because they have been on earth much longer than the other members of the family. Naturally you have accumulated all kinds of information and knowledge, outer knowledge, during your life. But this is no indication that you are getting divine messages and direct vision in your inner life.</p>
<p>When you get some message from within, please feel that listening to the message is itself surrender to God's Will. While obeying, you are swimming in the sea of Light. That kind of action not only expedites your spiritual progress, but it is the best surrender. To listen constantly to the divine Will is the best surrender. Again, the karma from action done on the basis of the morality and earthly knowledge you have acquired may quite often stand in your way. It can create problems for you.</p>
<p>I always say that only divine action leads us to God and not the so-called good action or bad action of the moral life. That does not mean we should become immoral. Far from it! But sometimes we give too much importance to morality. Let us say that while walking a person looks around to see if there is an ant, a worm or an insect on his path. If he sees any tiny creature, then he stops in order to avoid killing it; he won't move even though there is somebody waiting for him and he is supposed to go straight toward his goal. But he does not consider that every time he breathes in, so many insects and little creatures are destroyed.</p>
<p>Everybody stays on earth through the sacrifice of somebody else. God makes a sacrifice for all of us and that is why we live on earth. God's action is the divine action. God has asked us to breathe in; He has commanded us. Out of moral action if we stop breathing and die, just because we will destroy some of the little creatures, this is very far from God's intention. So this is karma. But the wisdom that comes from the heart tells us that God wants us to stay on earth and that He is inside us; He is inside those things that are being destroyed by us. If God Himself is in these creatures, then naturally nothing is being destroyed. God Himself is there. So we have to know which is divine action and which is our so-called good and moral action. Good action and moral action are totally different from divine action.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can the aspirant surrender while living in the world?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can the aspirant surrender while living in the world?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the aspirant is really sincere and absolutely honest, then he has to feel that the inner world is infinitely more important than the outer world. It is in the inner world that a divine decision first takes place. If the aspirant wants his outer life to be guided, moulded and transformed by the light of the inner world, then his outer life has to accept and abide by the decisions of the inner world.</p>
<p>When we say outer world and inner world, we are separating the two worlds. But for the real aspirant there is no outer world, no inner world; there is only one world. He listens only to his Inner Pilot, whom he calls his Guru, his Master. Then he is in the inner world, he is in the outer world and at the same time he is beyond both worlds. The disciple has to know that unconditional surrender comes on his part only when he feels that the inner world and outer world have become totally one.</p>
<p>How can the two worlds become one? The outer world can become totally one with the inner world when the aspirant listens to the dictates of the inner world. At the beginning, unconditional surrender is like a muscle. It can be developed slowly and steadily. But if it is not constant, this unconditional surrender will lose its strength. Today, somebody who makes unconditional surrender to the Supreme in his Master will say, "Whatever you say, Master, immediately I will do." Most of the time this surrender is for today only, for twenty-four hours; tomorrow it will be all conditional. But if total surrender becomes constant, that is to say, forever, then surrender becomes unconditional.</p>
<p>The outer world will always remain in doubt, anxiety, worry, fear and limited consciousness. But in the inner world, there is Peace, Light and Bliss in infinite measure. There the aspirant wants to deal with Infinity. That Infinity dawns on him only when he constantly listens to the Master. The Master's will and the Supreme's Will are always one; they can never be separated. The Master has no individual will. An ordinary person has his individual will, his egoistic will, his own personality. But the Master is not bound by personality or individuality; he just executes the Will of the Supreme. He is a channel. If the aspirant wants to make unconditional surrender to the Supreme in the Master or to the Master himself, then he has to feel that his inner world, his outer world, all his worlds, are inside the very heart of his Master.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we surrender our anxiety for liberation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we surrender our anxiety for liberation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> First of all, you are using the wrong word: anxiety. In the spiritual world, there is no anxiety. When you are full of anxiety, it means you are disturbed and perturbed. Anxiety comes when you have done something wrong or somebody else has done something wrong or when people misunderstand you. But when it is a matter of liberation, the word you have to use is 'eagerness'. Some people are eager to get liberation; again, some people are overeager. They say, "I have to reach the goal right now." It is like crying to become a millionaire overnight. These people are eager to realise God overnight, in ten minutes or in ten seconds, in the time it takes to prepare instant coffee.</p>
<p>Now, how can you control your eagerness? Eagerness as such is not bad; it is good. But eagerness is often followed by impatience. You should be eager to realise God today. When today has ended, if you have not realised God, then tomorrow you should again be eager to realise God. The same eagerness you should maintain tomorrow also and the next day and so on. This way, one day you will see that you have touched the goal. But if you become impatient, then you are limiting the strength of your aspiration. Your impatience will pinch you like a monkey or it will be like a tiger inside you that will be devouring you.</p>
<p>Impatience makes you feel that everything can be had for the asking, but it is not alike that. You have to pray for it. When you pray for it, then only you will be satisfied. If you work for something and then get the results, you are satisfied. Otherwise, you will not relish the results. The father has money, but if he gives all the money to his child, the child will squander it; he will not value it. But if the child works and then the father gives him money, then the child gets joy.</p>
<p>Eagerness should be maintained, but impatience should not be allowed to enter. In the spiritual life, when you want to realise God, eagerness is extremely good, but we have no right to the date. God has His own Hour and that is the time for you to realise Him. Pray to Him to grant you realisation at His choice Hour. Then you can try to accelerate your progress. At that time if He has decided that He will give you realisation in ten incarnations, He may change His plan and give it to you in forty years. But by pushing and pulling God you will not be able to get realisation today; by hook or by crook you will not get it. But if you pray, "O God, give me liberation, give me realisation at Your choice Hour," then God will be so pleased He will expedite your realisation.</p>
<p>There are many people on earth who say, "O God, I am in Your eternal Time. Let me take rest. I will live an ordinary life. You give me illumination in Your own time." But this is the wrong attitude. You have to work very hard every second, twenty-four hours a day, for liberation through your dedicated service, through your prayer, through your entire spiritual life. Then you surrender to God's Will. You say, "God, at Your choice Hour give me liberation." After doing everything that you can, you will see that realisation does not depend on your working very hard. It entirely depends on God's Grace. But He will give you Grace, He will show you infinite Compassion only when He feels that you have done your best, you have played your role. When you have played your role, He will play His role. He will give you what you wanted and infinitely more.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have many things to do, at that time you remind yourself so that you won't forget something. On earth you have twenty things to do at a time, so you constantly remind yourself of the thing that you consider most important in your life. Otherwise, the important thing you will miss. And sometimes you forget even the most important thing, while the most unimportant thing you do. If you feel that you have many, many things to reach in the spiritual life, then naturally there will be tremendous confusion and you will forget. But instead of reminding yourself, feel that there is nothing else for you to do except the most important thing. If you feel, "There is only one thing to do: to surrender to the Will of the Supreme," then why will you have to remind yourself twenty-four hours a day to do it? The Christ revealed the supreme secret when he said, "Let Thy Will be done." In the spiritual life, you should feel that surrender not only is the most important thing, it is the only thing.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can lose your existence in me in total surrender only by feeling that I am your most illumined part. I am part and parcel of you — you and I are one. Now you have to know that one part of you is illumined, most illumined, and you are trying to grow into that part. You are still unillumined. One part of us is transformed and the other part is not transformed. So the part that is not transformed has to feel its oneness with the illumined part and then it will be transformed by this oneness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Do you feel that most of your disciples are devoted and surrendered?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Do you feel that most of your disciples are devoted and surrendered?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are insincere disciples who doubt what the Master does for them in the inner worlds. But they say, "Let us have some faith in the Master anyway. At least he says that he does these things, although we don't feel it and we don't realise it. But let us believe what the Master says and let us also do something for him." Although it does not come from the bottom of their hearts, they inwardly say to the Master, "You say that you have done much for us. Therefore we say that we are going to do something for you."</p>
<p>But again, there are really sincere, dedicated and devoted disciples who feel that every day their spiritual Master does something significant for them in the inner world. These disciples are aware of real progress in their inner life as well as in their outer life. What they were before they entered into the spiritual life and what they are now shows them the vast difference between their past life and their present life. When they see the difference they get tremendous joy and they spontaneously try to dedicate their inner life as well as their outer life to the Master.</p>
<p>The Master offers to the sincerely devoted and dedicated disciples his true Concern, his soulful Concern. He offers to the doubting and insincere disciples his Compassion-Light. While dealing with them his Compassion overflows.</p>
<p>Now we come to the surrendering and surrendered disciples. If disciples have true devotion, then they will also have dedication. When they pass the test of dedication, when their dedication is complete, then they try to enter into the surrendering-world. First they try to surrender their inner life, then their outer life. At that time the Master gets a much greater opportunity to deal more effectively with the disciples' inner and outer beings. When an aspirant actually starts to surrender his inner life and his outer life to the Supreme in the Master, then the Master really sees his divine hope in that disciple. Gradually, slowly and steadily the surrendering disciple enters into the realm of the surrendered-world. And finally, when the aspirant surrenders totally, integrally and unconditionally, he becomes in no time the highest transcendental Pride of the Master and of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Now all of you know that Mother Earth has been blessed with many great spiritual Masters. Unfortunately, all of them have been most unfortunate in the matter of true, unconditionally surrendered disciples. Sri Krishna had very few disciples when he was alive. Only four or five persons knew who he really was. The Buddha's disciples misunderstood him when he took milk from Sujata, a beautiful woman, and they left him, although afterwards the Buddha, with his soul's inner light, recaptured them. There were only three or four people who thought that Sri Ramachandra was a real spiritual Master, not to speak of disciples who had made unconditional surrender to him. Sri Ramakrishna also had very few true disciples. In fact all the other spiritual Masters had the same fate. True, some Masters have hundreds and thousands of disciples. But when it comes to unconditionally surrendered disciples, the fate of these Masters is really deplorable.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can your disciples accept you unconditionally?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can your disciples accept you unconditionally?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you try to accept me unconditionally, I will be happy and proud. But it is simply impossible with our limited aspiration, limited determination, limited devotion and dedication, to surrender unconditionally in the beginning. Each moment you have to think of me. Whatever you do, do it with the idea that you want only to please me and not to please yourself or others. When you have this feeling, you won't be able to do anything wrong because wrong things will never please me.</p>
<p>Before unconditional surrender there will be many other steps. If you try to climb up one step at a time, it will be much easier. Unconditional surrender is most difficult. It is the last stage of the journey, the last rung of the ladder. Many times before people reach the last rung, they will get tired and fall down and break their legs because the journey is very difficult.</p>
<p>Your surrender is your highest divine pride. One who is really divine can make absolute surrender, implicit surrender, unconditional surrender. Nobody can ever realise God unless he has made unconditional surrender. If you are under the impression that only a God-realised person can make unconditional surrender and that for ordinary human beings it is impossible, then you are mistaken. I <em>did</em> make unconditional surrender, long, long before I realised God. So everybody was like you once upon a time — even spiritual Masters.</p>
<p>There are many Masters who did not get unconditionally surrendered disciples and that is why they could not give realisation to their disciples. A child must have hunger for the mango and not for something else; a disciple must have hunger for realisation and not for something else. If I do get unconditionally surrendered disciples from any part of the world, then their names will be forever recorded in my heart. Not only that, but I will also declare their victory to the world. If a disciple does not achieve unconditional surrender, then he has to take incarnation again and again. But if he is praying and meditating most devotedly, according to his capacity, then naturally he will realise God long before others who are not aspiring at all.</p>
<p>Only the chosen few who are destined to play the major roles in the Mission of the Supreme can be surcharged with this dynamic light which is called surrender, conscious oneness with the Master's will and the capacity to see the Truth through the Master's eyes. The seeker has not to tell the Master, "O Master, show me the Light," No! Instead, the seeker must say, "Master, let me see the Truth through your eyes." There is the greatest difference between these two requests. When one wants to see the Truth through the Master's eyes, then the Truth is absolutely the purest. But when one wants to see the Truth directly with one's own eyes, without the Master's help, then the Truth may play some tricks on him.</p>
<p>Truth may come in the form of temptation and try to take you away from your path. You will see that, like ignorance, Truth also tries to tempt you when you go to it directly. But when you go to the Truth with the help of the Inner Pilot, the Master, then Truth in its absolute, divine aspect waits for you. At that time there can be no temptation. There is only the feeling of absolute realisation and oneness with the highest Truth. You have the greatest advantage when you see Truth with the Light of the Highest inside you, which is your Master, the Guru, the Supreme, the golden All.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Absolutely. Physical work is the body's prayer, the body's meditation. You can surrender while you are washing dishes, while you are providing any kind of service. If you are surrendered to me, then you become a perfect instrument.</p>
<p>In prayer you go to God and ask Him to please do this or that; and in meditation God comes and tells you what to do. During your prayer you go up so your Father can please and fulfil you; and during your meditation He comes down and asks you to manifest Him. This kind of prayer and meditation you can do in the physical plane while you work. Devoted service is a real form of prayer and meditation. When you do dedicated service, you are performing the task of your soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At that time the ego is transformed. While you are bathing, your body becomes clean. When you jump into the swimming pool, you surrender your whole existence to the water and immediately your body becomes clean. Similarly, think of the ego as something dirty and throw it into the sea of light. When you make total surrender to your Master, you enter into the sea of Light and become illumined. When you enter into the sea of water, the dirt is dissolved but the body remains the same. You have not lost your body, but the same body is clean, purified. One minute ago it was dirty, but now you have jumped into the water and it is clean. In the same way when the ego enters into the sea of Light, when it surrenders its existence to the sea of Light, then immediately it becomes illumined.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day you can make your surrender to the Supreme in me. Before you make a decision, before you do something, before you even think of something, always have the feeling that there is someone who is inwardly concerned at every moment about your real progress, your real success, the real fulfilment of the Divine in you. When you feel that your Master is all concern inwardly for what you are saying, for what you are doing, for what you are thinking, then you can easily make your constant surrender to the Supreme in me.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> That is a very good question. A disciple who has made surrender to the Master has to feel at every moment that the Master is his harbinger and that he exists only for the Master, here on earth and there in Heaven. There are two worlds, Heaven and earth. Each disciple has to feel that he came to earth only for the Master and that in Heaven he will exist only for the Master.</p>
