  <h2 id="page-title">The storm</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The storm" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>A husband and wife had a small child only three or four years old. The parents were very, very happy with this beautiful little child.</p>
<p>One day the father was engrossed in reading a novel. He was getting so much joy from the story. All of a sudden the child started crying. The mother was ironing clothes, cooking and doing all kinds of work in the house, so she was unable to pay attention to the child.</p>
<p>The wife said to the husband, "Please, please take care of our child. He is bored. You are just reading, but I am working. I am unable to pay any attention to him. At least take him out for a few minutes. Perhaps the fresh air and the sun will do him good."</p>
<p>The husband was not listening. He was still reading, reading and reading. Then the child started crying very loudly. The wife said, "Please take him out! I am doing all this work. You are doing nothing! You are just reading."</p>
<p>The husband said, "What? How can you ask me to take him outside? It is thundering and raining heavily. A storm is raging, and you are asking me to take our child outside? He is our only child. He will fall sick and die. Do you want our child to be killed in this storm? Can you not see? The trees are all trembling. Are you a fool? At a time like this I have to take our only child outside?"</p>
<p>The wife said, "All right." Then she took the child outside. The sun was shining brightly. The mother stayed outside with the child for a few minutes until he became very calm and quiet. Then she brought the child back inside.</p>
<p>The father said, "How could you take our child outside when it is raining so heavily? Such a storm is raging!"</p>
<p>The mother said, "You idiot! Where is the storm?"</p>
<p>The father said, "I can prove that it is raining heavily outside."</p>
<p>Then he showed her the book. He said, "It is written here." In the novel it said that it was raining very heavily. He showed it to his wife to prove that the weather outside was so bad. That was why he did not take the child outside.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The zamindar&#039;s temple</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The zamindar&#039;s temple" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There was an honest, simple man. Everybody liked him because of his honesty. One day his house was robbed. He was very, very sad. But because he was very honest, his friends gave him money, clothes and everything else that he could possibly need. His friends were so kind to him that he soon had much more than he had originally lost.</p>
<p>One of the honest man's friends, who was quite rich, became very, very jealous. He said, "Let me also tell people that my house has been robbed."</p>
<p>That night he took his belongings outside his house, dug a hole and buried all his valuables, money and expensive things under the ground. Then he started crying that his house had been robbed. But because he was so rich, people were not showing any interest. He was not a good man, whereas the first one was a really good man. Nobody gave him any money, but he kept on crying and crying as if he had lost everything.</p>
<p>Then he did not know what to do. People were all watching him. He was miserable. He was only waiting for the day when he could dig up his valuables. He said, "Since my friends are not giving me anything, I will bring everything back into the house."</p>
<p>Now it happened that the zamindar wanted to build a temple. The zamindar said, "I have done many, many bad things in my life. Now I have to build a temple so people can come and worship. I will also go there to worship."</p>
<p>Since the zamindar could do anything he wanted to do, he gave some money to the rich man and said, "I am buying this plot of land." The rich man was totally lost. What could he do?</p>
<p>The zamindar wanted to build the temple immediately, so he started digging. All of a sudden he found so much money! The money that he had given to the rich man was nothing in comparison.</p>
<p>The zamindar said, "Look at this! Already God is so kind to me. God knows that this temple is for Him. I am building a temple, so God is giving me this gift because I am doing such a good thing."</p>
<p>The zamindar took away all the valuables. He felt that God was so pleased with him because he was building a temple for people to worship. The zamindar got the money and the rich fellow who wanted to fool people lost everything. So if you want to fool people, you also can be fooled.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The adopted son</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The adopted son" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There were two brothers who lived in two different villages. The two brothers were very close to each other. One day the younger brother came to visit the older brother. He saw that the older brother had adopted a little boy. He said, "What have you done? Have you not heard that adopted children always turn out to be very bad? People say that they destroy the whole family."</p>
<p>Because the older brother did not have any children of his own, he had adopted this child. The older brother said, "No, I think my case will be an exception."</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "There is no exception."</p>
<p>A few days later the younger brother went home. The older brother was lavishing and lavishing affection and compassion on his adopted son, treating him absolutely like a prince. And every day the son was becoming more and more notorious in every way.</p>
<p>One day the elder brother decided he would visit his younger brother. When he was almost at his place, the older brother saw that the younger brother was now living in a very small house. The older brother said to the younger brother, "What are you doing here? You had such a big house. What happened?"</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "My son is so greedy! He took all my money and everything that I had. Then he kicked me out, so I am staying in this small house. You see, even my own son has misbehaved so badly. I cannot imagine how much you will suffer since you adopted a son. My own son has thrown me out of the house, and he has taken all my property. He is enjoying his own life with his wife and children. So I can scarcely imagine how much you will suffer!"</p>
<p>The older brother said, "No, no, I am not suffering at all."</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "How is it that you are not suffering?"</p>
<p>The elder brother said, "I was sick for quite a few days. Then my adopted son did something so good."</p>
<p>"What did he do?"</p>
<p>"He gave me poison, and I died. Now I am so happy in Heaven. My adopted son was torturing me like anything. Then, when I fell sick, he wanted to get all my money and all my property, so he put poison in my food and I died. Now I am so happy!"</p>
<p>How could this happen? The subtle body of the elder brother had come to visit the younger brother, taking exactly the same form as the physical body. Every day the adopted son had been torturing his father. Finally, the adopted son had given him poison and killed him. The father was so happy in Heaven, whereas on earth he had been absolutely miserable.</p>
