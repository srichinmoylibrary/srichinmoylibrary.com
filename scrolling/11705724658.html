<p><em>[A long pause follows, in which Sri Chinmoy meditates with Russell Wilson. Then Sri Chinmoy gives him a few of his books — for himself and for his wife, Laurie.]</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Do you play tennis or any other sport?</p>
<p><em>Russell Wilson:</em> I used to be on the national Fencing Team, and now I am chairman of the United States Fencing Judges' Commission. I put in ten years of my life as a professional fencer, but I don't do it anymore. Now, unfortunately, the business of trying to solve nuclear problems in North Korea and putting out fires between Pakistan and India is taking up most of my time. I don't have much time for it, but it is a wonderful sport. As someone who was on a national team, I can tell you that the kind of things that you do give so much inspiration to people who are training to reach their goals.</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> I am trying to be of service to mankind. Our philosophy is that physical fitness and spiritual activities must go together. We do not aim to become world champions, but we want the body to be fit. Only then will we be able to hold the message of the spirit when it enters into the body. The physical body has to be in perfect condition in order to execute the will of the soul. To be a champion is not the goal of our life; our goal is to become a good instrument of God in anything that we do.</p>
<p>There was a time when your parents were your world. Then your town, your city, your state and your country became your world. Now the entire humanity has become your own. Humanity has become your brothers and sisters. You feel that all the countries are like branches of the one life-tree. You look at the life-tree and see that one branch is not doing well. You feel that it is your bounden duty to fix this branch so the tree can be perfect. Then you see that another branch is creating problems, and with your heart's love you go there. Any time you see a defect in the tree, your heart goes there to make that particular branch perfect. For that I am very proud of you, very proud of you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Russell Wilson: Without spiritual satisfaction, it is very difficult to do that work.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Russell Wilson: Without spiritual satisfaction, it is very difficult to do that work." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If you have inner poise and inner joy, then you can serve humanity happily and cheerfully. But if there is only a barren desert inside, it is impossible to give cheerfully. We can give only what we have. If I have joy, then I can be of service to you. But if I have nothing inside to give, then what will you be able to receive from me? I may be able to fool you for one day or two days, but eventually I will be caught and you will dismiss me.</p>
<p>I have come into the world to love the world and become one with the world. If I am serving you and you take my service lovingly and affectionately, then I get as much joy from you as you get from me. At that time the giver and the receiver offer one another equal joy. If I give you a smile and you take it with joy and love, your joy and my joy are equal. So the giver and the receiver are on the same level. At this moment with my right hand I am putting something into my left hand; the next time my left hand will put something into my right hand. So the giver and the receiver always go together.</p>
<p>Today we have meditated together. But you have to know that I am not the Guru. There is only one Guru, and that is our Lord Beloved Supreme. He is your Guru, my Guru, everybody's Guru. Only in this particular field, spirituality, perhaps I know a little more than you do, just as you know infinitely more than I do in the field of politics. If I want to learn politics, then I have to come to you. The only thing is, I do not want to learn that subject — it is beyond my comprehension!</p>
<p><em>Russell Wilson:</em> That makes two of us, Guruji!</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To me, politics is very often filled with confusion, and I try to stay away from confusion. But to the political world also we have to try to bring illumination. Politics I do not understand, but the individuals who are studying that subject I love. That is why I meet with political leaders and mix with them. I hope that my love of those who are studying politics will one day enter into the field that they are studying.</p>
<p>I wrote something about politics and spirituality that came out in an Indian magazine. There I said that since politics is a branch of life, we cannot discard it. If we can bring spirituality into politics, then politics can play a most significant role in fulfilling God's Will. When the leader of a country says something, even if people do not like him, his words carry tremendous weight. And if he makes the right decisions, then he can offer so much illumination to his countrymen and to the world. We pray to God to make the political leaders receptive to His Will so that this world of ours can become a perfect garden for God the Gardener to cherish. We pray and pray to God to make the politicians spiritual so that at every moment they can offer illumination to the world at large.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Russell Wilson: Guruji, I have a very difficult question to ask you. Why, in India, which some believe is the centre of all religion and where spirituality plays such an important role, is there so much strife and tension?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Russell Wilson: Guruji, I have a very difficult question to ask you. Why, in India, which some believe is the centre of all religion and where spirituality plays such an important role, is there so much strife and tension?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because I am an Indian, I am able to answer this question. Once upon a time, India was the land of peace. Now there is constant quarrelling and fighting. Why? The answer is very simple. God has given us freedom and we have misused it. At every moment we, as human beings, can choose to do either the right thing or the wrong thing. I can get up early in the morning and pray and meditate to become a good person, or I can sleep until ten or eleven o'clock and get up when it is too late for me even to go to work. Perhaps for six months I received light from Above and my sincerity, my integrity and my love of God compelled me to get up early in the morning to meditate. But after six months I stopped aspiring and thinking of God, so I no longer get up early to pray and meditate. Outwardly I am the same person, but in my inner life I have changed.</p>
<p>In the hoary past, politicians used to go to spiritual Masters for blessings and illumination. One of the greatest Indian heroes, Shivaji, used to go to his spiritual Master and say, "Please advise me." Then Shivaji got fed up with his country and with politics. He said, "It is all corruption. I no longer want it." But his spiritual teacher compelled him to remain in politics. He said, "If you give up, then who is going to transform this world? Stay in your post but only think of me. The Supreme in me will guide the country in and through you."</p>
<p>There was a time when India had poise and peace of mind. But India was not satisfied with its inner peace and poise. It wanted to compete with America. Unfortunately, India began to lose its spirituality when it entered into the world of competition. It is one thing to retain your own height and then give what you have and receive what someone else has. But India, instead of maintaining its pristine purity and divinity, became greedy and started to care more for outer wealth. It wanted to become as rich as America, and it no longer gave as much importance to its inner wealth. That was India's greatest mistake.</p>
<p>If God gives me something, I should cherish it. Then, when the hour strikes, God will give me something else because He is pleased with me. But if I reject what God has given me and cry only for something else, then the inner qualities that I once had will desert me and I will be a beggar. India should have remained grateful to God for what God gave to India. Instead of trying to imitate the West, it should have cherished its own divine qualities. But when it began to care less for its inner wealth and more for outer wealth, at that time my Mother India began to lose something very precious.</p>
<p>Something similar is now happening in the former Soviet Union. President Gorbachev was responsible for awakening the consciousness of the Soviet Union. After he had awakened the Soviet people, he said, "We have been asleep for many years and we have just awakened. So right now let us walk slowly, steadily and unerringly to our destination. Then, when the time comes and we have more capacity, we shall march, and later we shall run." But the people did not listen. They became very greedy and wanted to be just like the West. They wanted to run right from the start, even though they did not have the capacity. So they chose another politician who promised immediate results. We all want to have instant realisation — like instant coffee. We want to have everything in the twinkling of a eye.</p>
<p>It takes a child a few years to learn how to walk. If I tell that little child that he can run as fast as his elder brother, then the child will be inspired to try. But, unfortunately, he will only break his leg. A mother will always tell her child, "No, go slowly. Your brother is five years old and you are only one year old. How can you expect to walk alongside your brother?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Russell Wilson: May I ask you just a few more questions on meditation? When is the best time to meditate, and for how long should I meditate?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Russell Wilson: May I ask you just a few more questions on meditation? When is the best time to meditate, and for how long should I meditate?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two times that are most important. The first time is when you get up in the morning, before you enter into the hustle and bustle of life. Then, in the evening, when everything is calm and quiet, for ten minutes or so before you go to bed you can invoke the universal peace into your system.</p>
<p>When you meditate early in the morning, it is like earning a spiritual salary. You meditate for fifteen minutes or a half hour and put the spiritual wealth that you receive inside your heart-pocket. Then, during the day if you have to talk to some colleagues who are quarrelling and arguing and are immersed in the world of confusion, you can withdraw some of the peace, love and light that you accumulated early in the morning and give it to them. As you take money from your pocket, even so from your heart-pocket you can take spiritual wealth and offer it. That is how we use our spiritual wealth to bring about world peace.</p>
<p>It is also good if you can meditate every hour during the day. It does not have to be exactly on the hour. Only keep aside a minute or two each hour to think of God and talk to God. Nobody will know what you are doing. Outwardly you may be talking with your colleagues, but inwardly you are talking to God. You can just repeat God's Name. You can say 'God' or 'Supreme' or anything you like. Those who follow our way of life use the term 'Supreme'. When I say 'Supreme', immediately I feel more of a close inner connection with God — in the same way a child gets a more intimate feeling when he calls his father 'Papa' instead of 'Father'. But you can call Him anything you like when you are praying or meditating.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Russell Wilson: Do you advocate meditating with the eyes open or closed?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Russell Wilson: Do you advocate meditating with the eyes open or closed?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The eyes should be half open. If you keep your eyes wide open, there is often tremendous tension. If you keep your eyes closed, on the other hand, you may fool yourself. You may think you are meditating when actually you are in the world of lethargy and sleep. You may think that you have meditated for ten minutes when most of that time you have been asleep. It is not that you have to meditate for a set amount of time. No! What is important is to meditate until you get peace of mind, until you feel that love, joy and purity have entered into your system and filled it to the brim.</p>
<p>If you keep your eyes half open, you are in control of both the inner world and the outer world. Half your consciousness is in the inner world and half is in the outer world. This is called the meditation of the lion. I tell my students to meditate with their eyes half open so that they can communicate perfectly with both worlds. This is the safest way.</p>

SCA 148-152. These questions were asked by Mrs. Noemi Kovanda, wife of the Czech ambassador to the United Nations, during a meeting with Sri Chinmoy at Annam Brahma Restaurant on 13 June 1994.</p>
<h2>Mrs. Kovanda: I have to tell you that our baby is a greater and greater joy for us every day. I wish I could feel what he is feeling!</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day he is bringing you a surprising new joy. Your son is a most beautiful flower, a most beautiful rose with so many petals, and petal by petal he is blossoming every day. Every day a new flower is blossoming inside his heart-garden; at every moment of the day and night its petals are blossoming.</p>
<p>If you want to feel what he is feeling, you can meditate on his heart, especially when he is sleeping.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mrs. Kovanda: I would like to ask you how I should meditate, concerning the baby.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mrs. Kovanda: I would like to ask you how I should meditate, concerning the baby." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At this stage, when he is only a little baby, it is better for you to pray. This will be more effective and more fruitful than if you meditate. When he is six or seven years old, at that time you can start to concentrate and meditate on him. But now I think it is advisable for you just to pray for anything that you want him to have. You are observing daily how many good qualities he has. So you can pray to God to increase those good qualities. On the strength of your prayers, the good qualities that you already see in him you can try to increase. Again, if you see certain qualities that he does not have but you feel he should have, you can pray to God to give these to him. You can ask God to add to the good qualities that he already has.</p>
<p>Along with your other prayers for your sweetest child, please pray for two more things: peace and bliss. Pray to God to inundate the child's head with peace and to inundate his heart with love. Bliss may be difficult for the child to conceive, but love he can easily understand. He loves his mother and his father so much. As soon as he sees you or his father, he feels tremendous, boundless love. Bliss comes from love; if there is love, there is bliss.</p>
<p>While praying for your child, there is another thing you can do. Please try to imagine that he is breathing in and out. As soon as he starts to inhale, you can start your prayer; and when he releases his breath, you should finish your prayer. You have to pray very quickly. Sometimes when you are holding him in your lap or keeping him on your shoulder or very close to you, you will be able to feel or hear him breathe, and you can match your prayer to his breathing. But even if your imagination does not coincide exactly with the time that he is breathing in and breathing out, no harm. Your imagination has a reality of its own. In a few days you will be able to develop the capacity to synchronise your prayer with his breathing. This will be the most effective way for you to pray for whatever you want for him.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can definitely concentrate and meditate for your husband and for yourself. For your husband, you can concentrate or meditate inside your heart or between and a little above your eyebrows, which is the third eye. You can do whatever comes naturally. Early in the morning, when he is about to go to work, it is good if you can concentrate on him. Your concentration-power will enter into him and help him during the course of his day. He is doing so many important things, and he cannot concentrate most powerfully all the time. When the hustle and bustle of the political world enters into him, with the concentration-power that you are offering him he will be able to concentrate most powerfully and focus on what he is doing most intensely.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when he comes back home tired and exhausted, bringing the whole political world back into your apartment, at that time you can meditate for peace to enter into him. When he is desperately trying to get rid of politics from his mind and he only wants to have love from his wife and from his child, that is the time you will meditate for peace. At that time there is no politics, no mind; it is all heart. So concentration is needed to help him at his office during the day, and meditation is needed when he comes back home so that he can have all peace, all love and all joy with his family.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You are doing absolutely the right thing. When you pray for health, you are praying not only for the physical body but also for the mind, vital, heart and everything. If your health is not good, if you are suffering from a headache or stomach upset or some other ailment, then how will you be happy? Your mind will be occupied only with pain; your heart will be breaking. The best thing is to pray first and foremost for health. Afterwards, you can pray for other things that you would like to have.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Mrs. Kovanda: Should I pray in silence or out loud?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Mrs. Kovanda: Should I pray in silence or out loud?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Praying out loud is always better. If you say out loud, "O God, please bless me with good health. Grant me love, joy and peace," then your physical mind will be convinced. But you do not have to break down the ceiling! You do not have to pray that loudly. Although I was born a Hindu, I also love Muslims and feel that they are my brothers. But when they pray in the mosque, they pray so loudly that you can hear them at quite a distance. We Hindus feel that as long as you can hear your prayer with your own ears, then you are convinced that you are praying and that is enough.</p>
<p>While praying, you are using words: "O God, give me this, give me that. Do this for me, do that for me." At that time you can speak reasonably fast — the way we are talking now. Pray loudly enough to hear yourself and also at your normal talking speed. But when it comes to meditation, try not to have any words or any thoughts at all; try to keep the mind empty. Every thought or idea that enters into your mind you have to silence. If you cannot silence it, then try to slow its speed. If some current of thought is entering into you very rapidly and you cannot stop it altogether, then try at least to slow it down. Eventually you can try to silence it. Also, to make the mind more silent, it is good if you can imagine something very peaceful, such as the vast sky early in the morning or the setting sun in the evening. Or you can try to feel that you are at the bottom of the sea, or on the top of a mountain in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>While you are praying, you are talking to God and God is listening to you. While you are meditating, God is talking and you are listening. While you are praying, your prayer is going up high, higher, highest. Then while you are meditating, God's Love, Light, Peace and Bliss are entering into you. That is the difference between prayer and meditation.</p>
<p>There is also another difference. When you pray, try to feel that you are utterly helpless. You have to pray like a beggar-woman asking for alms: "God, give me this." And you have to sincerely feel that you are in desperate need of what you are praying for. You have to feel that your whole world will collapse if you do not get it. Unless your prayer is fulfilled, you will be absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>When you meditate, on the other hand, you have to feel that you are a princess, or a queen, or the dearest daughter of God, with infinite wealth inside your heart. When meditating, you are bringing to the fore your own divinity and inner wealth — your own inner peace, inner bliss, inner love, inner joy. You are not inventing these things; they belong to you and you are discovering them.</p>
