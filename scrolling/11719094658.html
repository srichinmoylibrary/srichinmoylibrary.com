<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are many ways, but I will tell you the two main ways. First, you can repeat a specific mantra or you can say 'God' or 'Supreme' as slowly and quietly as possible. While repeating this, please feel that God's divine qualities are entering into your mind; do not simply repeat like a parrot. Each time you repeat 'God' soulfully, feel that a divine quality is entering into your mind. When this happens, the Power of God's Light is bound to silence the mind.</p>
<p>You want to silence your mind because it is acting like a restless monkey. Restlessness comes because of darkness; darkness and restlessness are inseparable. Restlessness is due to your lack of receptivity to light. There are two places where light is available: above the head and inside the heart. When the mind is illumined, restlessness is transformed into tranquillity. When you can bring down light or carry it from the heart into the mind, at that time the mind becomes calm and quiet.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> As a student you come to a school and see the teacher and the students. If they satisfy you, if you feel an affinity with them, then you go to that particular school. Similarly, you come to a spiritual Master and see his students and hear about his path. If you feel an affinity with the path, then it is meant for you. When you see a Master, if he gives you intense joy, if you feel he can easily solve your problems or has the capacity to illumine you, if you experience a feeling of oneness, then undoubtedly he is your Master. If you don't feel an affinity with the Master and his students, it doesn't mean that you are insincere. No, you <em>are</em> sincere, but he is just not the Master for you.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: My own spiritual background has taken me into different paths of meditation: Buddhism, Zen and other forms.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality is only one subject. It is not like history, geography, science and mathematics, for which you need different classes. It is only one subject, and for that it is advisable to walk along one path. The Goal is one and it is at one particular place. If we constantly change our roads, then our progress will naturally be slow. Today we prefer one road and tomorrow we feel that there is another road which can take us to the Goal faster. So we are only changing from one road to another and not making progress on any road. Each path is right in its own way. No path is faulty. But we have to know which path suits us, which path satisfies us most. Once we discover the path of our soul's choice, if we walk along that path only, we will reach our destination sooner than otherwise.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: The Bhagavad-Gita talks about purification. How can I be purified?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: The &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/em&gt; talks about purification. How can I be purified?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How can you be purified? You can purify your existence, your inner and outer life, just by feeling deep within yourself a living flower, a burning flame and an incense stick that is burning all the time. The incense, the flower and the candle flame symbolise purity. If you can feel within yourself, for example, a beautiful flower, a rose or lotus or any flower that you cherish, then you are doing the right thing. Today it is imagination; but if you continue imagining for five days or ten days or a month or two, then you are bound to see and feel the flower within you. First you may feel it, then you are bound to see the existence of the flower, and then automatically the fragrance and the purity of the flower will enter into you to purify you.</p>
<p>We have to feel that we have within us all the divine qualities. If we feel that we don't have them, then it is almost impossible to get them. If we feel that God is within us, for that reason one day we shall see God face to face. But if we think that God is not within us, that He is somewhere else, then we will never see God. If we want to achieve something in our life, first we have to feel that we have that very thing within us. And because we have not yet discovered it, we have to use our imagination-power to help bring it to the fore.</p>
<p>Also, we have to feel that we are God's children. Now we can't feel it. We have done many things wrong and to say that we are God's chosen instruments is a self-mockery. This is what we feel. But if we continuously say, "No, we are God's chosen children. Deep within us is divinity. God is there, only we have covered Him with our ignorance," then we are bound to bring our inner divinity to the fore. So try to have that kind of feeling. You have to feel that God is within you, purity is within you; only you have to reveal it. How do you reveal it? You reveal it by imagining within yourself the things that you see around you as pure — flowers, incense, candles — and then automatically one day you do become purified.</p>
