<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Like a farmer, God scatters seeds here and there. When He is throwing the seeds, He does not say, "The plant that grows from this particular seed has to be far better than the rest." No, He just scatters seeds here and there, like in a divine factory. It is the receptivity of one particular place which causes that seed to grow faster than the rest and to become more beautiful, more radiant.</p>
<p>You can observe a classroom. The teacher tells the same thing to all the students, but one student will stand first in the examination and another student will stand last. They have heard the same thing, but because of the receptivity of the first boy, he did well and because of lack of receptivity, the other one could not do well.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Usually it is said that a few are chosen for the spiritual life and the rest join it by some miracle. In my case, I say it is the other way round. The fact is that there are so many groups, so many Masters, why is somebody inclined to follow my path? True, he may be making a mistake, but the fact is that he is not choosing some other group; he is choosing me. So even if I do not choose you, you are choosing me. Then the question comes, why are you choosing me? It is because you see something in me, that is why you are choosing me. Let us say I am a flower and I am also the fragrance of that flower. I gave you something. I gave you the beauty of the flower to appreciate and the fragrance of the flower to enjoy. You may say, "No, it is because I saw the beauty in the flower that I enjoyed the fragrance." Either way is fine. If I want to take the credit, then I chose you because I gave you the fragrance; if you want to take the credit, then you chose me because you saw the beauty. So it is mutual.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I am always so disappointed when promising seekers leave our path.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I am always so disappointed when promising seekers leave our path." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You should not be disappointed, because you have done your duty. Your duty is to offer them the aspiration that you have received from this path. Then it is their choice whether or not to believe in you. You have played your role. You have received a mango from me. You have tasted the mango and you have discovered that it is so delicious, but some other person, without tasting it, may say that it is not delicious at all. As soon as that person sees the mango, they do not feel any joy.</p>
<p>But somebody else is holding another fruit; so that person goes there and tastes the second fruit. Do not be disappointed. You are not that individual who is not appreciating the mango. If you have offered them the mango most soulfully and devotedly, then you have played your role most satisfactorily. You should be disappointed only if you have not done it soulfully, devotedly and sincerely. If that person is now interested in somebody else's fruit, why should you be disappointed?</p>
<p>Our goal is not to take countless people to the Destination; our goal is to take only those who are meant for us. There are many, many people who are not meant for this path. Again, there are many who are meant for this path. Unfortunately, you have not been able to approach them. But I have never said that the whole world should follow this path, far from it. Why should there be only one boat? There can be many boats and many boatmen but the Destination is the same. The only thing is that our boat still has plenty of room to house many, many more seekers.</p>
<p>So if you are not successful today, do not be disappointed. Try some other day or go to some other place and try. But if you are disappointed, it will affect your subtle nerves, your spiritual nerves. Then tomorrow, when the time comes for you to give another course on our philosophy, you may not get any inspiration.</p>
<p>Remain cheerful and try, try again. If nobody comes to your course, it is not your fault. I know there are many, many, many seekers who are not meant for our path. Again, we cannot always say that for each and every person the Hour has not yet struck. That is a wonderful explanation, but there is a way to expedite God's Hour. If you want to expedite God's Hour, those who are awakened should be more self-giving, more willing to devote themselves to this path.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the spiritual way to approach our job?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the spiritual way to approach our job?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It depends on the job you are doing. If you are working at a particular place only to maintain your livelihood, to defray the costs of your earthly existence, then do your work the way you are supposed to do it. You have to please your boss, you have to be regular, punctual and so forth.</p>
<p>But if your job is directly connected with our Mission, let us say you work in a Divine Enterprise, at every moment you have to feel that God Himself is in front of you. Between the customer and the one who is serving, there should be a brief connection, an inner connection. It is an exchange of goodwill. You are serving and the customer is eating or buying a book or something else. The person who is serving has to do it more carefully, more sincerely and more soulfully. He is consciously following the spiritual life, whereas the other person may be a good person by nature and that is why he is receiving something from you.</p>
<p>If you are working in an ordinary job, you have to be regular, you have to be willing to create harmony in the section, not to create any problems and so forth, but there you do not have a higher goal. There is only one goal: to go there regularly and to get the salary at the end of the week. Again, in order to live on earth, you need a salary, so it may be necessary for you to stay in that job and do your spiritual work in the evening or on the weekend.</p>
<p>But if you are working at a Divine Enterprise, then you are getting much more opportunity to be spiritual. You may not get a proper salary, but at every moment you are getting a tremendous opportunity to become more spiritual because the goal is right in front of your nose. At every moment you are reminded that you have a goal, you have a goal. Each Divine Enterprise has a very special message to offer, not only to the disciples but also to humanity. Please try to keep that message right in front of you at every moment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: All your musical instruments belong to you, but when you travel, you perform on the piano or organ that belongs to that particular concert hall or establishment. Does the consciousness of all the people who have played those instruments in any way affect you?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: All your musical instruments belong to you, but when you travel, you perform on the piano or organ that belongs to that particular concert hall or establishment. Does the consciousness of all the people who have played those instruments in any way affect you?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the beginning, when I meditate for two or three minutes, I dive deep within and at that time I do anything that is needed. If purity is needed because some undivine person has played, then purity will be granted. The thing is that when I enter onto the stage, nothing affects me. I am not thinking of purity, I am not thinking that a great player has played before me. I do not think of anything. I enter into a state of consciousness where neither the instruments nor the persons who have played before are able to affect me. If I play for five minutes or fifteen minutes, while I am performing, I am playing in my own way. I am not allowing my heart or my musical talents or my consciousness to receive anything either from the individuals who have played or from the hall itself.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Recently sports writers have been talking about a feeling in all kinds of athletes where everything slows down. What is it all about?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Recently sports writers have been talking about a feeling in all kinds of athletes where everything slows down. What is it all about?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If I understand your question correctly, it is like a smooth sailing. In the beginning, all kinds of personal effort is necessary. For years an athlete may work very, very hard, with tremendous intensity. Then, during his race, he feels that he is not moving at all; but actually he is moving — like smooth sailing. At that time, he may not realise that he is not the doer. Somebody else is doing it in and through him.</p>
<p>When Bill Rodgers is running a marathon well, he is coasting. He may be running for 20 or 26 miles, but he is maintaining the same speed or even increasing the speed, but with no effort. So something is definitely doing it in and through him, otherwise he would have remained at the same spot.</p>
<p>When you start a machine, you hear all kinds of noises. It takes time to warm up. But once the machine is operating at full speed, you do not hear those same noises. That is like coasting in marathon running. At the beginning of a race so much personal effort is required, but then, when it becomes smooth sailing, sometimes you do not appreciate it because you have the feeling that you are doing nothing.</p>
<p>At that time, definitely Grace has descended and God has added something new to your capacity. Because God is pleased with you, he has given you the thing that you asked for, let us call it a mango, and He is bringing you an apple as well. God says, "Since I am pleased with you, I am giving you both a mango and an apple, and now you will be the happiest person." Although you did not ask for the apple, God is giving it to you. Then you will offer God your tears of gratitude.</p>
<p>Receptivity increases only in one way: by increasing our gratitude to God. There is no other way to increase receptivity. You can offer gratitude to God not only for what you have, but for what you are going to have. What you already have, what you are right now, how can you deny? What you are going to have or what you are going to become, you may not know. But you can use your imagination. The more gratitude you can offer to God, the more you can create positive thoughts, positive ideas and positive goals for yourself.</p>
<p>In my case, when I lifted forty pounds for the first time, I offered gratitude to God most sincerely. If you see that I make rapid progress when I enter into a new field, it is all because of my sincere gratitude to the Supreme. I know I cannot do it. I cannot do anything. If I have done anything in my aspiration or dedication or manifestation, it is all due to gratitude. God gave me a little capacity and because of my gratitude, God is increasing the capacity.</p>
<p>So if you want to increase any good quality in your life, just increase your gratitude to God. If you are an artist, offer gratitude; if you are a cyclist, offer gratitude; if you are a singer, offer gratitude. As an individual, you have capacities in perhaps seven or eight areas. For each thing, try to offer gratitude to the Supreme.</p>
<p>This morning, if you had a good meditation, if you did not suffer from doubt, fear, anxiety, worry, jealousy and so on, then offer gratitude, sincere gratitude. The following day, your meditation will be better.</p>
<p>We can offer gratitude to God not only for the positive things in our life but also for our weaknesses. We can say, "God, I am so grateful to You that I have only one weakness, it is limited, whereas there are many people on earth who have countless weaknesses. In their case it is unlimited." If you can offer gratitude to God because you only have one weakness, then God will take away that weakness. But if you blame God for your weakness, if you find fault with Him, what can He do?</p>
<p>Some seekers attack God. They say, "I have done so much for You, for years and years, how is it that I still have these weaknesses? How is it that You did not remove them?" What can poor God do? So our gratitude-heart can be of great benefit to us. The more gratitude we can offer to God, the more He will increase our receptivity and capacity in so many different fields.</p>
