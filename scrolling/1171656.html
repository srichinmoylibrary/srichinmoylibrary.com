 <p>
SCA 1167-1171. These questions were asked in 1976.</p>
<h2>Question: How can we see life itself as art?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When you have a good thought, feel that it is your art. You have created that good thought. And the next thing is, that good thought has to feel the necessity of manifesting you. So your creation is your thought, and your thought's duty is to manifest you. Anything that you do from now on should be based on that realisation.</p>
<p>When you talk to someone, immediately the goodwill that you feel for that person must come to the fore so that you can manifest more of your divinity.</p>
<p>If art and life cannot be combined, then life will not be fulfilled. Art in life is your aspiration and art without life is inconscience or ignorance. You have to combine art and life at every moment while you are aspiring. It is your life and when you do not use it to aspire, that is your spiritual death. While you aspire, you are alive. While you are not aspiring, you are dead.</p>
<p>In a sense, you can say that both life and death are art. But the art that is not alive has to be brought into the art that is alive. We are in ignorance. That is one art, true. Again, if we are aspiring to become a divine instrument of God, that is another art. So the lesser art, which we right now represent, has to enter into the higher art.</p>
<p>The lesser or inferior art is lack of oneness with God and the superior art is conscious oneness with God. Every day you stand between the inferior art and the superior art. Early in the morning, when you pray and meditate, you create a higher art. At that time you are consciously aware of God. Then, during the day, the moment you are about to forget God, just catch your awareness and throw it into your morning prayer. In this way, you are compelling your inferior art to enter into the superior.</p>
<p>Life is divided into conscious art and unconscious art, superior art and inferior art, higher art and lesser art. So it is you who have to be between the two arts and throw the lesser one into the higher one, the inferior into the superior, the unconscious into the conscious. Then life's problems will be solved.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: With each new day, how can I have the feeling of transcendence, especially in meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: With each new day, how can I have the feeling of transcendence, especially in meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day comes to you as a new hope, new promise, new aspiration, new energy, new thrill and new delight. You have already seen thousands of days and tomorrow will dawn in its turn. If you think that tomorrow will be just another day like the thousands that have gone before, then you will make no progress. You have to feel that tomorrow is something absolutely new. You are going to create something new in your life.</p>
<p>Or you can remember one particular day when you got tremendous joy, or the day that you accepted our path wholeheartedly. On that day you got the greatest joy. I accepted you and you accepted me. Remember that, and try to go one step forward. When tomorrow dawns, if you can have more delight than on that special day in your life, then remember tomorrow's greater joy. And the following day, try to go one more step forward. Always try to go forward. From joy we can have greater joy; from greater joy we can have greatest joy.</p>
<p>Now, how can we transcend ourselves? You can transcend yourself only by discovering and maintaining your joy. If you discover your previous joy, and then if you can maintain it, you will have energy to go one more step forward. To go ahead, you need capacity. But if you do not have the first capacity, which is joy, then you cannot have the second capacity and the third capacity.</p>
<p>You are lying down, then you have to get up. That is the first capacity. When you get up, you have to start walking. That is your second capacity. The third is to run fast, faster, fastest. So in this case you have to think of the first day you entered into the spiritual life seriously. That is your first capacity. Tomorrow you should get more joy. That is your second capacity. The third day try to cultivate more aspiration, more promise to yourself, more serious promise to the Supreme. Every day you have to energise yourself to such an extent that you can feel new hope and aspiration. If there is no hope, that day is dead. If there is no promise, then I am dead.</p>
<p>If we want to live on earth, we need hope. This hope is not our mental hallucination. Far from it! Hope is like a vast, sunlit field. Promise is the seed. If you do not have a field, how are you going to sow the seed? The seed grows and your promise is fulfilled only through constant aspiration. Aspiration was inside hope. Now it is inside promise. Then you will see that one day it will germinate, one day you will get the fruit of your aspiration, which is realisation — constant, conscious, inseparable oneness with the Supreme, the Highest.</p>
<p>At every moment bring forward newness, newness. Then only you will see that you will transcend yourself. Always have newness in thought, in action, in speed. Then you can transcend what you have got. What you have is good, but it is not enough. You need something more. What for? Not in order to personally fulfil or aggrandise yourself, but for the sake of the Supreme. If you do not have infinite peace and light, how are you going to manifest the Supreme?</p>
<p>Hope and promise at every moment you have to treasure. From hope and promise you have to think of Infinity. A day will dawn when you will fulfil the message of Infinity.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: When our team was mountain climbing recently, we had quite a few conflicts of personality among the different members.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: When our team was mountain climbing recently, we had quite a few conflicts of personality among the different members." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Individuality and personality will ultimately disappear in our universality, but first we have to know our individuality. If we do not know that we have something undivine inside us, then why should we become divine? If we are already perfect, what is the use of spending hours and hours crying for God-realisation?</p>
<p>Just because we have not realised God, we are crying for God-realisation. Just because you are imperfect, you are crying for perfection. Just because you have ego, personality, you are trying to illumine it. The sooner our shortcomings come to the fore, the better! Otherwise, these shortcomings lie dormant in our consciousness and it may take quite a few centuries for us to illumine them.</p>
<p>So whenever you notice undivine forces in yourself, do not be disappointed. On the contrary, be grateful to the Supreme that they are coming out. It is very painful, but they are coming out. Once they are out, we are totally free. If these forces come — personality, ego, jealousy and so forth — do not be frightened, do not be disappointed. Feel it is another opportunity.</p>
<p>I had a friend who used to say that each obstacle, each hurdle in life, is an opportunity if it is taken as such. Otherwise, if undivine forces remain inside us, they are secret enemies. God alone knows when they will strangle us. If we see the problem right in front of us, we can change; but if it is deep inside, we do not see it. Then, in an unconscious moment, these forces can destroy us.</p>
<p>So let them come up. Do not worry when these problems arise. Let us fight to the end. Our Inner Pilot is bound to illumine us. Only feel that you are all of the same Source, you are all of the Supreme and for the Supreme. Feel that all the members of your team are like the notes in the scale. Each one is significant; each one represents real wealth. When you sing, you have to use all the notes. Then only will you have a beautiful song. All are necessary. So here also, think of yourself not as an individual, but as a note. Each note has the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have to accomplish something individually, at other times collectively. When we accomplish something individually, it does not mean that we can look down on others. We should not think, "I can do this. Others cannot do it." No. We should think, "I, as an individual, have got the opportunity to show my capacity. But I know that it is the Supreme in me, not anybody else, who is showing His Capacity."</p>
<p>And if somebody else has the opportunity to do something extraordinary, try to feel that the Supreme in you and the Supreme in him are the same Person. In this way, individuality has to surrender to capacity. If an individual does something, please feel that he is an extension of your own existence. He is part and parcel of your consciousness. You can go even further and try to feel that it is you who have done it. We have two hands. We can use one hand and let the other take rest or both hands together can play the game. In this way we establish oneness.</p>
<p>My divine pride I am offering to each member of this group. Physical brothers appear and disappear, but spiritual brothers remain together eternally. Unlike human friends and human brothers, spiritual brothers are Eternity's friends.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Not at all. Very often, when one is deprived of something, he becomes haughty. Then negative forces attack that person. For a few years he may feel sad and miserable, but humility does not come. Humility is something that comes from within. Humiliation does not bring humility.</p>

<h2>Question: Tonight you gave an aphorism encouraging us to practise 'ancient disciplines'. Could you please elaborate on that?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> To start right from the beginning: one ancient discipline is to meditate in the small hours of the morning, not at seven o'clock or eight o'clock or nine o'clock. It has to be around four o'clock or three o'clock or even two o'clock. You can try to start at three o'clock. That is the first ancient discipline. In Vedic times, meditation started between three o'clock and half past three. That is called <em>brahma muhurta</em> — 'The Hour of God'.</p>
<p>The second ancient discipline is chanting. In Vedic times, the seekers and sages used to recite mantras hundreds of times. Now we have made it simple. Our mantra is 'Supreme'. Some of my soulful songs are also like mantras. Since you have not studied Sanskrit or the Indian scriptures, you can sing these songs. Even if you are not a singer, try to sing in your own way as soulfully as possible. Another thing that you can do early in the morning is to read my writings.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to sing <em>The Invocation</em> every day. This Invocation is our mantra. Here it is my own life-breath and my disciples' life-breath that I have offered. I have composed thousands of songs, but in terms of my inner depth and spirituality, my own aspiration and realisation, I will always consider <em>The Invocation</em> as the most effective and fruitful mantra. Sometimes, when you sing it most soulfully, I can see that your aspiration-flames are mounting to the highest Heavens from your own depths. I see how fast your aspiration-flames are climbing. I see your flames, flames, reaching the Highest.</p>
<p>So try to practise ancient disciplines early in the morning. At least one hour or an hour and a half you can spend in prayer, meditation, reading spiritual books, and singing devotional songs. If you have some favourite songs, they will definitely help you in the same way that the Vedic seekers received abundant inspiration and aspiration from their mantras.</p>

SCA 1177-1182. These questions were asked on 9 August 1989 at Aspiration-Ground, New York.</p>
<h2>Question: You once said that there is a new consciousness growing in Austria. What is it?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Long live the Austrian consciousness! In the Austrian consciousness I am seeing both dynamism and eagerness. Some people are dynamic, but they have no eagerness. Still others are eager, but they have no dynamism. But the Austrian consciousness has both. I am very, very pleased with Austria.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely your soul selected that particular town. There are countless towns on earth. Why did your soul choose that particular town? So here the choice itself is something significant.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: There is a saying that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Is that true in the spiritual life?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: There is a saying that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Is that true in the spiritual life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Spirituality is not a matter of pulling and pushing. Those who pull and push are eventually pushed aside and pulled behind. Pushing and pulling is not spirituality. Spirituality is surrender to God's Will, patience, tolerance, acceptance of the situation for its transformation.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the situation does not mean that you are surrendering to the situation. But you have to accept something in order to transform it. If you do not accept it, how are you going to transform it? If you see some obstruction on the street, some dry wood for example, if you do not pick it up, how are you going to keep the street clean? Spirituality is like that. You accept something, then you transform it.</p>
<p>If somebody tries to come near me by pushing others aside or by pulling them out, then that person can never be close to me. In spirituality there is no pushing, no pulling, but only cheerful acceptance, a cheerful feeling all the time.</p>
<p>Whether you have come late to the meeting and you have to sit at the back, or you come before anyone else and you can sit at the front, be cheerful. Cheerfulness if you have, no matter where you are — right in the front row or at the back — that is how you will receive the utmost.</p>
<p>You have to know that the Master hides. He can be looking at one person, but his heart will be looking at someone else, his heart will be working inside someone else. So try to have that cheerful consciousness no matter where you are; my eyes can be looking at another person, but my heart will be working inside your heart.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If we are aspiring to do something like swim the English Channel or run 1,000 miles, how can we know if it is your will or just a desire on our part?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If we are aspiring to do something like swim the English Channel or run 1,000 miles, how can we know if it is your will or just a desire on our part?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You can easily ask me, "Shall I do it?" Then if I see that you have the capacity, I will say, "Do it." If I do not see the capacity, I will ask someone else to try. I am very proud of one German girl who has swum the English Channel and, again, six German girls have swum it in a relay. So one has done it all by herself and six have done it together. How can you know if you should try? Just ask me. And if you get permission, then you can try. And if you fail, do not give up. But first you have to know whether you have the capacity.</p>
