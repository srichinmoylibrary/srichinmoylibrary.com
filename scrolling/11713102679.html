<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Definitely. From the angel world to take human incarnation — is it not progress? Again, it is only through a human body that you can realise God. If there is no body, no vital, no mind, no heart, you can never realise God.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Those souls have their own divinity. They do not need an angel's help to come and visit their dear ones. Angels are always hovering over this earth-planet. They should be invoked by the sincere seekers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Most of the time angels have to be invoked. Again, many, many times they come without being invoked — they can come unconditionally. Usually people invoke angels unconsciously. Consciously, people think of God and then God may send an angel as His emissary.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can be their intuition or it can take place in a dream. Sometimes when people dream, their third eye is unconsciously open and they can see angels. But again, while they are awake, if they want to open their third eye without having the spiritual capacity, it is impossible. On another level, sometimes when God, the Highest Absolute, wants to manifest in and through someone, He will give that person an angelic touch.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels play the harp. In size, their harps are quite small. Some of the harps that we see are much larger than angels' harps. Their harps do not have as many strings as the big harps that we have.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Angels do sing, but they are more oriented towards instrumental performance. They like music more than words and melodies. On the one hand, angels are all majesty. On the other hand, they are so sweet and beautiful. Sometimes sweetness and power do not go together, but in the case of angels, they have both sweetness and power. Their power is not like atomic power. Their power is more like flute-power, while the fairies' power is more like drum-power. The angels' flute-power is subtle and delicate and, at the same time, it is all brightness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The cosmic gods and goddesses are infinitely higher than the angels. There is no comparison between the power of the cosmic gods and goddesses and the angels. As I said before, between a real doctor and a nurse, there is a great difference. When there is an emergency, a serious medical problem — a bullet has entered into my chest — the nurse will never dare to operate. The doctor has to come.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If in a room twenty angels come to you, they will have so much brightness and poise. But in the same room if you have three fairies, it is enough. It will be like a kindergarten. Again, there can be some exceptional fairies. Exceptional fairies are so cute; they are so in tune with the highest Divinity. But it is very, very rare to find that kind of fairy.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: As we have an angel to watch over us, is there also an evil force that watches over us?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: As we have an angel to watch over us, is there also an evil force that watches over us?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. But the evil forces are much more alert than the divine forces. Mothers have such faith in their children. They will say, "My child cannot be so bad." Because of the mother's own divinity, she will say this. Again, if the father does not smoke, then he will never be able to believe that his son is smoking marijuana. Then after a few years, when he sees that it is happening again and again, he will believe it. But in the beginning it will be impossible for him to believe. The mother and father will always judge according to their own standards.</p>
<p>The hostile forces get tremendous joy by breaking the pride of the parents. In the same way, angels are trying to help mankind, but unfortunately these hostile forces come and try to destroy all the angels' good work.</p>
<p>Each individual is not only represented by divine forces, but also by hostile forces. Consciously we can take the side of the divine forces. Again, unconsciously we can take the side of the hostile forces. Here I am talking to the divine part of you, and you are listening to your Master, the divine part of you. You are not invoking the hostile forces, but I can see that there are undivine forces inside each of you — in some cases, absolutely huge hostile forces.</p>
<p>Again, every day it changes. The day you take more the side of the divine, the hostile force inside you is small. Another day if you do not take the side of the divine, it becomes huge. On the day you have not prayed and meditated, the hostile force becomes like an elephant.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may happen that the very day you have prayed and meditated, the hostile forces accumulate some power. You may be in a very good mood, but on that day the hostile forces can take the absolutely largest form to destroy your faith in God. Early in the morning you may get up to pray and meditate, but on that day you may hear about some calamity in your life. Then you may lose all your faith in God, in your Guru or in your spiritual life.</p>
<p>That is how the test comes. At that time you have the golden opportunity to make unconditional surrender to God's Will. The day you have done everything good may be the day that you are getting all kinds of unfortunate experiences, devastating experiences. That very day is the golden chance, in a positive sense, for you to become truly spiritual. In the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna says, "Do your very best. The results place at the Feet of God." Here, also, you did your very best. You got up early in the morning and prayed and meditated. You sang spiritual songs. You took exercise. Everything divine you did. Then you got some absolutely unbearable experiences — a car accident or something else.</p>
<p>At that time, you have to say, "Oh, it could have been worse. I had a serious car accident; I could have died. At least I am still alive!" That is the divine way of looking at it. The undivine way is to say, "I prayed and meditated. Today of all days, instead of other days when I did not pray and meditate, I have had an accident! Why do I have to pray to God? Why do I need God?"</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: If somebody has left the spiritual life, is it because the hostile forces grew much stronger than the positive forces?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: If somebody has left the spiritual life, is it because the hostile forces grew much stronger than the positive forces?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In the battlefield, gradually, gradually those seekers came to the point where they did not want to fight. A real seeker will fight to the very end. I will fight for God's Victory in my life every day. Every day I will try to bring down divine Nectar. But in the ordinary life, people fight for two or three months, and then they give up. They feel that if they do not get the victory after two months, why should they go on fighting continuously? That is the human way.</p>
<p>The divine way is to say, "I will fight every day for God's Victory. I will not rest on yesterday's laurels. Every day I will enter into the battlefield of life. I will only pray for God's Victory — today, tomorrow and every day."</p>
<p>Some people will say, "If I prayed so sincerely, why did the results of my prayer not last for at least ten days?" Somebody else will say, "No. The time that I spent praying and meditating saved me for today. Tomorrow again I shall have to pray and meditate to be safe again tomorrow. Day by day I shall renew my prayer and meditation."</p>
<p>In the ordinary life, if you have one thousand dollars, then for ten days or more you will be able to use it. But the inner wealth is not like that. You cannot be satisfied with the inner wealth that you already have. You have to increase it. Otherwise you will be in trouble. There will be many days when you will get up early in the morning doubting yourself. If you do not increase your inner wealth, then doubt-poison will devour you.</p>
<p>We expect not only from the world but from ourselves. When we expect from the world, if we do not get the thing that we expect, we become sad for five minutes. But when we expect something from ourselves and we do not get it, the whole day is ruined. Very often our expectation of ourselves we take more seriously than our expectation of somebody else.</p>
