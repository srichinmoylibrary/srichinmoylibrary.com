<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Because the physical mind is engrossed in the physical consciousness. It is constantly doubting itself and others and creating confusion and uncertainty for itself. Unless and until the mind gets light from the heart, it remains in the darkness of human bondage and limitation. This is, unfortunately, the nature of the human mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Every day try to think of your mind as an empty vessel. When you deal with the mind, if the mind is empty, that means already you have made considerable progress. You have emptied out ignorance, worry, imperfection, limitation and all undivine things. Now what will you do? You will fill this empty vessel with joy, love, purity and all divine qualities.</p>
<p>You want to purify your mind. You will find abundant purity inside the heart and the soul. It is very difficult for people to feel the soul, but it is not difficult to feel the presence of the heart. When you can feel the presence of your heart, you have again made progress. Then, every day meditate on the heart, trying to feel that this heart is composed of nothing but purity. Once you feel absolutely sure that your heart is composed of purity, then every day take a little bit of purity and pour it into the empty vessel that is your mind.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is think of your mind as an empty basket. Try to feel inside your heart a blossoming tree of purity. Every day pluck one purity-flower from the heart-tree and put it inside the mind-basket.</p>
<p>Gradually the basket will be filled to the brim, and the mind will be filled with the fragrance of innumerable purity-flowers.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The best thing you can do is learn a few spiritual songs and sing them to yourself in silence while you are working or driving your car or doing anything that does not require mental concentration. While you are chanting in silence, your mind is being purified because your soul is coming forward.</p>
<p>When you chant or sing, try to feel that the Supreme is listening. Otherwise, the chant will become a mere mechanical habit. So feel that there is a listener — not a human listener, but the Supreme Himself — listening inside your heart. When you feel that you have a divine listener, you will get more inspiration; you will be surcharged with boundless inspiration and endless inner joy. When you feel the presence of the Supreme inside your heart, He will bless you with utmost joy and pride. He will do everything to transform, purify, illumine and liberate your mind.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we touch water, what happens? We feel the consciousness of water. When we touch fire, we feel the consciousness of fire and burn ourselves. Something pure or divine can also give us its own consciousness. We know that the soul is absolutely pure, absolutely divine, but we feel that it is a tremendous task to find and enter into the soul. But we have to know that we also have a heart. Next to the soul in purity and divinity is the heart. The heart is infinitely purer than the mind or the vital or the body. So let us try to identify ourselves with that particular part of our being that will offer us purity. When we pray, when we meditate, we must try to identify with the heart, which is crying for truth, for light, for beauty. Let us identify with the heart; let us not identify with the body, vital and the mind, as we are doing now.</p>
<p>Before you do something, no matter what it is, please try to identify yourself with the heart, which has purity, which has love, which has the feeling of divine oneness. The heart will give you its own vibration, its own consciousness. If you can touch the heart with your prayer and meditation, you are bound to be freed from the body-consciousness, You will feel only the consciousness of something infinite, something eternal, something immortal, something divine.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They are entirely different. The mind is attached to the physical consciousness and is extremely limited. The soul is a divine spark which is always one with Divinity. The mind is impure and unlit. The soul is all light; it can never be impure. When we live in the mind, our mind dominates us. When we live in the soul, it does not impose but only guides us. The mind makes us feel what we are not. The soul makes us feel what we are. The mind stays with us for only one incarnation, but we have the same soul in every incarnation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Animals have souls and human beings have souls, but the soul of an animal is scarcely comparable to the soul of a human being. Human souls are infinitely more complex and more elevated in terms of evolution. Similarly, the human mind can hardly be compared with the divine mind, although there are points of similarity. When contact with the divine mind is established, such as when a realised spiritual Master answers questions, the error, confusion and ignorance of the human mind can be abolished.</p>
<p>The divine mind is never disturbed by anything. When we are attentive with the physical mind, everything other than what we are concentrating on is a disturbance. The tick of a clock, the noise of traffic, a radio or television playing are all disturbances to the physical mind. But when a person is in the divine mind, all the noises of the world merge with the cosmic Sound or the cosmic Silence, and neither noise nor anything else can be a disturbance. The divine mind is never disturbed by anything, for it is neither limited nor separative. But the physical mind is constantly being disturbed and distracted because its capacity is extremely limited.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Is it possible for anyone to live in vast expansion of mind, or is this only possible for a realised soul?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Is it possible for anyone to live in vast expansion of mind, or is this only possible for a realised soul?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> An aspirant can experience vast expansion of mind for a few minutes when he is in a very high, deep meditation. But only the realised soul can have this vast expanse of the mind constantly. We are making a mistake, however, when we use the words 'expansion of mind'. When the mind expands into vastness, there is no mind, there is no form. In the mind there is always limitation. When we experience the vast expanse, at that time we have gone beyond the domain of the mind. When we go beyond the mind we feel that the mind has expanded, but we have actually entered into the expansion of our soul's peace. We feel we are experiencing the expansion of the mind, but it is the transcendence of the mind that we are experiencing.</p>
<p>Only the realised soul can enter into the vast expanse of Light, Consciousness, Peace and Bliss and stay there indefinitely or permanently. For the ordinary aspirant or seeker, this is not possible. An advanced student can remain there for ten or fifteen minutes at most. But again I wish to say this is not the expansion of the mind, but an experience of something far beyond the mind. It is only when we come back from the highest level of Consciousness that we try to understand everything with the help of the mind. That is because right now the mind is the highest part of our ordinary human consciousness. When we want to expand our consciousness, our physical reality, we have to enter into the soul. The soul, not the mind, has the power to expand our consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can we learn to feel that we are the soul and not the mind or the body?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can we learn to feel that we are the soul and not the mind or the body?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> In India there was a great spiritual Master named Sri Ramana Maharshi. He used to compare the body to a banana leaf. In India, especially in the Himalayas, on festive occasions we eat our meal on a banana leaf and after we have eaten we throw away the leaf. Sri Ramana Maharshi used to say that the soul utilises the body in this way, leaving the body at its choice hour and discarding it as a now-useless instrument. It is the soul that has the eternal connection with the Supreme, and not the mind or the body.</p>
<p>In order to realise that you are not the mind, that you are the soul, first you have to go beyond the mind. There are two ways to do this. One is to go up through the various levels of the mind and then pass beyond. The other process is to bring down Light from the higher planes into the mind. When the higher Light descends into the mind, at that time the mind does not remain an obstacle to our inner realisation of our conscious oneness with our soul's existence.</p>
<p>If you want to feel that you are the soul and not the mind, you can do so through contemplation or through intense faith. If you can meditate or concentrate on the spiritual centre called <em>sahasrara,</em> you can learn to feel that you are the soul and not the body. This centre is at the top of the head. If you can concentrate there successfully, you will see your limited physical consciousness slowly and steadily going out of your physical body. At that time, the physical mind which is binding you will also leave you. Then what you will have within, without and around you will be the soul. You will feel at that time that you are the soul and not the body or mind.</p>
<p>Another way to go beyond the mind is to concentrate on the third eye, the eye of vision. If you can focus all your attention there, you will have flashes of intuition which will enable you to see beyond the mind. You can also concentrate on the heart. If you can concentrate there properly and soulfully, the inner flame which is aspiration will climb up from the heart centre to the throat centre, then to the third eye, and finally to <em>sahasrara,</em> the thousand-petalled lotus at the crown of the head. When this spiritual centre is fully opened, automatically you go beyond the mind.</p>
<p>It is usually difficult to concentrate on the third eye, because there you do not get immediate joy or a sense of fulfilment. But if you concentrate on the heart, you will feel love, peace, fulfilment and boundless joy. You may concentrate or meditate on the third eye for about six months and feel the whole time that you are walking in a barren desert. If you are prepared to walk on a barren desert and continue and continue in spite of the frustration, then you can try it. But if you concentrate on the heart, on the day that you sincerely and soulfully start, you will get a sense of joy, peace and accomplishment.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How can one have confidence in flashes of intuition?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How can one have confidence in flashes of intuition?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> You have to know your own standard of spiritual light. While walking in the street, or while doing anything, you can have a flash of intuition. But you have to know on which plane your consciousness is at that time. You have to know your own standard and see from what level the so-called intuition has come.</p>
<p>Intuition and intuitive knowledge cannot come from the conscious mind or from the subconscious plane. Intuition is not bound by the mind; it is something beyond the mind. The realm of intuition is far above the mind's region. Whenever you get a flash or a truth from the intuitive plane, it does not need any support from the mental, vital, or physical plane for manifestation. It is divinely individual and supremely universal. And it has the power to awaken and illumine the seeker.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If an idea is wishful thinking, the next moment or in a few hours a serious doubt or a kind of fear will come to contradict the idea. Wishful thinking does not carry with it the certainty of Reality, whereas intuition does. The power of intuition within you may not function at your command, but it will guide you occasionally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> A thought that is followed by joy or sorrow is an imaginary thought. But a thought that we feel deep inside our heart is a real thought. It does not need the assistance of anything to make us feel its reality. Real thoughts come from a plane of their own, a world of their own. This world is a realm of pure thought. If you can touch this world you can bring real thoughts down to yourself. Unlike an imaginary thought, a real thought is self-evident and self-sufficient. A real thought is alive and dynamic like a river. When we feel any idea or thought deep inside our heart, we can rest assured that it is a real thought. In the mind, also, we can sometimes get a real thought. If the thought comes from the mind and enters immediately into the heart, then it is a real thought.</p>
<p>We can create real thought by using the power of our soul's will. If we concentrate on the heart and go deep within, and if we can knock at the door of the soul, from there we will get only real thoughts, real ideas, real messages. If we can open the door of the soul, immediately the soul's will will automatically be transformed or channeled into thoughts which are absolutely real. A real thought always has power, assurance and a sense of accomplishment, whereas an imaginary thought will not have any of these.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we become what we think?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we become what we think?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, not just by thinking, but by exercising our inner will-power. If I want to become the richest man on earth, I cannot do it just by thinking about it. I have to concentrate and bring forward my soul's will-power. The more I can identify with my soul's will-power, the easier it will be for me to manifest whatever I want to manifest. First we have to discover our inner will-power, and then we have to exercise it. If we do this, we can become whatever we want to be.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we reach God through the intellect alone?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we reach God through the intellect alone?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Through the intellect alone you can never, never, never reach and know the attributes of God. It is impossible! God's true Existence, true Height, true Form are millions and billions of miles away from the intellectual domain. At the same time, you cannot say that God does not exist in the intellect. God is omnipresent. But God's highest Height, deepest Depth, all-pervading Consciousness, one can never, never realise through the intellect.</p>
<p>If we are totally without intellect, we remain in the animal world. When we enter into the human world, intellect does help us. For an ordinary human being, the mind is the highest stage in the process of evolution. The more one is mentally awakened and fertile, the greater is his capacity to achieve and to fulfil himself here on earth. But we must come to feel the limitations of the intellect. By living in the mental world we will find no poise, no peace — only two naked swords fighting against each other. My intellect will fight against your intellect. But these swords can never cut asunder the thick veil of ignorance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Does a God-realised person use the mind and the ego?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Does a God-realised person use the mind and the ego?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> He does not use the mind as an ordinary human being knows it. When realisation takes place, the seeker's mind automatically becomes illumined. This illumined mind is not the same as the physical mind or intellectual mind, which are unconscious, unlit and confused. The realised soul does not use the mind at all when he has to do something serious or sublime, and when he does use the mind, it is the illumined mind that he uses.</p>
<p>When an ordinary man uses the term 'I', he is referring to his ego, his little self. But a God-realised soul regards himself either as the most faithful servant of the Supreme, or as entirely one with the Supreme. He has no ego. An instrument can never be as important as the doer. A God-realised soul knows that he is at one with the Divine, and he says 'I' merely because it is the simplest manner of expression in this world of duality and multiplicity.</p>
<p>Some Indian Yogis sometimes advocate using a word which means 'Thou'. One great Indian saint always used to say about himself, "He did it", "He ate it." 'He', in this case, meant the Brahman, the Absolute. But these verbal distinctions are not really necessary. One who has realisation knows that when he says 'I', he is not referring to the ego. Rather, through him the self-revealing Truth is being expressed at the Will of God.</p>
