<p>About two weeks ago, a disciple gave me a note. In the note he said that he had had a very, very vivid dream of his mother’s passing, his father’s passing and his sister’s passing. All the members of his family had died, and the dream was extremely vivid. I did not have to do anything in the inner world, because I saw that the dream was not at all true; it was absurd. When you have dreams or frightening experiences that bother you, please write to me.</p>
<p>We all have dreams, almost every night. There are many reasons when you have bad dreams. The most common reason is that you do not sleep properly. You lie down on your chest, or either one palm or both palms you place on your heart chakra. That is not good at all. When you lie down to sleep, do not put pressure on your heart chakra. You may think that very lightly you have placed your palms on your chest, but it may not be true. Even unconsciously you may be pushing your chest. When you sleep, do not keep your arms on your chest. Just keep them relaxed.</p>
<p>Before you go to sleep, you can concentrate on only one chakra. That is the <em>Manipura</em> chakra, the navel centre. From there on down, lower forces, undivine forces, unaspiring forces, can attack the sleeper. In the spiritual life, when it is a matter of protection, the most important thing is always purity. Purity has to be given first and foremost importance in the spiritual life; otherwise we shall have serious difficulties. Purity is not something delicate or powerless. Purity’s strength is unimaginable, absolutely unimaginable. If you concentrate on the navel centre, it will help you considerably. At that time you do not have to concentrate on the heart, on the throat, on the forehead or on the top of your head, the crown centre.</p>
<p>Many spiritual Masters have suffered and even now are suffering, I am sure, because of the hostile forces. Some hostile forces have the capacity to take the forms of spiritual Masters or Indian gods and goddesses. When I was fourteen or fifteen years old, I meditated for about two hours at night. I used to get up at seven minutes past two. On one occasion I was resting a little, lying down on my bed, and my hands were not on my chest. All of a sudden I saw a most beautiful figure that had the appearance of Lord Vishnu, but it was not the real Lord Vishnu. A hostile force had such tremendous power that it was able to take the form of Lord Vishnu.</p>
<p>By that time I knew that when hostile forces attack us, we have to show them our purity. They can fight with everything that we have, but when we show them purity from the central being, from the heart, they will fail. I had read this, and also I knew it inwardly. When I brought forward the strength of purity from my heart, that figure of Lord Vishnu burst. It had no physical form, but against the wall it was standing. What a horrific sound it made! It was four-thirty or five o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Then what happened? From across the street, Nolini’s son Ranju and his friends came, and people from upstairs came down because the sound was so loud! From across the street they came at four-thirty in the morning, because this kind of sound we do not ordinarily hear. My brother was in the same room, in another bed, and I did not have the heart to say anything. I was pretending that I was fast asleep. My brother heard the sound, and he said to me, “Did you not hear the sound just now?" I said, “I will tell you tomorrow. Now I want to sleep.”</p>
<p>From upstairs a Gujarati man came with a big stick to beat the culprit! Where was the person for him to beat? How could he beat the force that had taken the form of Lord Vishnu?</p>
<p>The hostile forces have the capacity to give someone a heart attack, if he is not aware of them, and if he does not use the power from his own heart. Purity is a power! I know of at least four instances where that kind of heart attack took place. A hostile force took the form of somebody’s dearest beloved and the person thought, “My dearest beloved has come to me.” If you see this kind of form, never bow down — never! You may say, out of devotion, "O my God, Lord Vishnu has come! Then let me bow down.” Never, never bow down! As soon as you bend your head or bow down, you will be kicked. Your life-energy the hostile force can take away, or it can destroy one of your limbs. I have read and I have experienced it — not in my personal life, but in the lives of some of my close associates. Some of them were of a very high order, and some of them had even realised God.</p>
<p>Again I am telling you, hostile forces can take the forms of divine beings. But if the Master is in the physical, and if the disciple is quite devoted, the disciple can be saved. In my case, I have said that hostile forces will not be able to take my form. I said it, but some people did not believe me. One of my very close disciples, one of my dearest disciples, was attacked. He said that he had seen me in the inner world, and I told him that his vision was absolutely false. Outwardly I was telling him, “No, no, no!” but he did not believe me. He enjoyed the form he had seen inwardly. I said to him, “I have told you that nobody can take my form.” I scolded him so powerfully! I said, “Believe me — I am here in the physical!” From that morning on, he was completely all right.</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo had a disciple from Chittagong who was on the verge of God-realisation. Once somebody wrote to Sri Aurobindo, “What can the hostile forces do against the divine forces?” Sri Aurobindo wrote to him, “Tell me what they cannot do! My disciple was on the verge of God-realisation.” He was a very devoted disciple of Sri Aurobindo, very, very devoted and very close. He said that at night Sri Aurobindo had come to him and told him something. Sri Aurobindo said, “Wrong, wrong! I am in the physical! How is it that you are not listening to me? You are listening to your dream and not to me!" How badly the mind can be distorted!</p>
<p>Hostile forces do exist. Nowadays quite often I give prayers on protection. What is today’s prayer?</p>
<p><em>[The disciples repeat the prayer:]</em></p>

<p>“My Lord Supreme,<br /> Right from the day I was born,<br /> My life has been<br /> Your Compassion-Protection-Abundance-Indulgence.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>You know perhaps seven or eight instances of protection in my life, including the boat experience, the scimitar experience, Mother Kali’s protection when I collapsed after running, and the experience of seeing my mother in the eyes of a tiger.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Coming down from the highest meditation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Coming down from the highest meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>From 1946 to 1952, perhaps, over a six-year range, I used to go up high, very high, during my meditation. When I came down, I could not remember my name. It took me a long time to remember my name. For at least ten or fifteen minutes I could not remember. There was only one way for me to know: by looking at my notebook. I was a student, and we had to write down our name for the teacher to see. This happened many, many times.</p>
<p>Sometimes in my room I was meditating and one of my dearest friends or admirers would be there. He was not meditating; he was only watching me and seeing how high I was going. When I came back down, I asked him my name, and he told me. Many times this happened.</p>
<p>Sri Ramakrishna used to go up very high during his meditation. In two ways he would come down. One way was to touch his disciple Brahmananda, either his leg or some other limb. Then he became perfectly normal. Before that, he did not remember anything after he came down. He did not know where he was or what he was. This happened again and again. On other occasions, his disciples who were near him when he came down from his meditation used to give him a hookah to smoke. When he smoked, he remembered everybody’s name, because he had completely touched the earth-consciousness.</p>
<p>Quite a few times after meditating I used to go out of our house to the dining room, which was about four hundred or five hundred metres away, with only one sandal. One foot had a sandal and one foot had no sandal. I continued walking, and people would say, “What are you doing? Why are you wearing only one sandal?" Then I would go back and get the other sandal.</p>
<p>At times something else happened. There was a place where we would drop our plates after eating. A few times it happened that after eating I did not go there. I went straight out of the building and into the garden with my plate. People asked me, “What are you doing here?” There was a small park where I used to have very high meditations, and I walked there at least two or three times with my dish.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Impossibility does not exist!</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="Impossibility does not exist!" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Impossibility does not exist! The term “impossibility” exists only when we use our mind.</p>
<p>One may have a big palace, but he may prefer to live in a small, cosy cottage. Sometimes even a king or an emperor may wish to live in a cottage. The mind will say, “How can a king live in a tiny cottage? Is it not beneath his dignity?” No! The king can choose to live in a cottage; it is quite possible. Man uses the term "impossibility,” but God says that it does not exist.</p>
<p>The mind will see in the ocean countless drops. To the mind, these drops are inside the ocean, so the ocean is infinite and the little drops are finite. The finite is inside the Infinite. How can we see or feel that inside one drop is the ocean itself? For the mind, it is impossible! But the soul sees the reality on another plane of consciousness. If we can enter into that consciousness, immediately we see the entire ocean inside one drop.</p>
<p>A seed grows, and gradually, gradually it becomes a banyan tree. We see the banyan tree; it is exposed. The seed was under the ground. We were not able to see it; now we see only the vast tree. But if we have access to another plane of consciousness, there we will see inside the seed the entire banyan tree. It is not a mental hallucination! Right now, we cannot go to that plane. That is why our mind has fixed ideas about the banyan tree and the ocean. How can it be that inside a seed is the tree? How can it be that inside a drop is the ocean, when it takes countless, countless drops to form the ocean?</p>
<p>There is a plane of consciousness which we cannot see and we cannot enter into with our present human consciousness. That is why we immediately say that something is impossible. But if we can raise our physical, earth-bound consciousness to a very high level where the mind cannot interfere, we shall see that what we call impossibility is more than possibility. The mind cannot even imagine that that plane exists. On that plane we see that inside the drop is the ocean; inside the seed is the tree. As long as we use the mind, we will never, never have this experience and we will never, never be able to believe it.</p>
<p>Impossibility is in the physical world, the earth-bound world. In this world, it is all limit, limit, limit, limit! The mind is limiting everything. It can go a little, and then it stops. It can come a little closer, and then it stops. But the soul does not limit anything. The soul starts with Eternity and Infinity. For the soul, nothing can be called impossible. We see that a three-year-old boy has run a marathon in India. He is three or four years old, and he runs, runs, runs. Here is the proof that some of the realities of the higher worlds have descended to this world. Otherwise, how can a three-year-old boy in Bihar run a marathon?</p>
<p>So many things are happening! These feats the mind will never, never, never believe. Even if they are performed right in front of someone’s eyes, his mind will not believe it. Some reporters say, “Even if we see you perform these feats, we will not believe it." This is the supremacy of the mind and the limitation of the mind. Even if we achieve something right in front of some people, they will not believe it, because their mind has formulated the idea that it is impossible.</p>
<p>In this Creation of God’s, so many things are considered impossible, but they are quite possible. If we enter into the higher worlds, we will see that these things are more than possible. They are happening every day, every day, every day. If we can go a little beyond the mind, then we are ready to believe everything.</p>
<p>If I cannot do something, but I hear that somebody else has done it, I will never say it is impossible, because I know that it is possible! I have done many things in my own life. If I can perform a so-called impossible feat, you can also do it. God is not my sole monopoly, so how can I say that others cannot do the impossible? If I cannot do it, that does not mean that somebody else cannot do it.</p>
<p>If some villagers hear something remarkable, the first thing they say is, "No, it cannot be, it cannot be, it cannot be!” Science is making such progress in the West and everywhere, but if you tell these villagers that something extraordinary has happened, they will say, “Impossible!” Their consciousness and their awareness are so limited, but they judge the entire world as if they had such a high degree of knowledge or wisdom! If you ask them about America, their ignorance will say, “No, no, America does not exist.” What does exist for them? Only their little village — beyond that, nothing. Only if some of their relatives go to America and come back will they believe in America. They do not even go to the next village, but with supreme authority they declare about anything, “It does not exist, it does not exist!”</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, there is a Sanskrit saying: <em>Neti, neti, neti</em>. It means, “Not this, not this, not this.” People repeat this saying. Then, finally, they surrender, and they go beyond their limited awareness.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">I wanted renunciation</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="I wanted renunciation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>We have just watched a performance of my play about Sri Chaitanya. He threw his book on logic in the Ganges to save his friendship.</p>
<p>In 1951, for a few days I was thinking of <em>sannyasa</em>. Renunciation, renunciation — give up, give up everything! By that time I had many, many notebooks full of my poems, short stories and other writings. At around eight-thirty one night I said, “No more! These things are only for name and fame. I do not want name and fame. I do not care if people appreciate my poems; I do not want it. I want renunciation.”</p>
<p>The Bay of Bengal was less than a hundred metres from our house. I said to myself, “Now it is eight-thirty. Before my brothers come back, I will become a real renunciate.” The idea had come, so I took about twenty notebooks and I came out of my room to throw them into the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>There was a main gate that was huge and very heavy. We needed a key to open it on both sides. As I approached the gate, I was so happy that I was going to renounce my name and fame.</p>
<p>My brother Chitta usually used to come home at around nine-thirty or a quarter to ten. He was in the Ashram, praying and meditating. On this occasion, as soon as I opened the main gate, whom did I see? My brother Chitta! On that day, instead of nine-thirty or ten, he happened to come back at eight-thirty. I thought that, before he came back, it would all be over! He grabbed me and scolded me. Then I said, “I do not want name and fame.”</p>
<p>Chitta said, “All right, you do not want it, but I want name and fame for you! ” He grabbed all twenty of my notebooks and brought them back. If he had not appeared, today I would have been without those twenty notebooks.</p>
<p>That divine or foolish idea of renunciation came to me. Because of my brother, today I still have those notebooks. My brother usually came home at nine-thirty, or sometimes even at ten o’clock. But on that day, at eight-thirty he happened to appear! If he had come a minute or two later, by that time I would have reached the Bay of Bengal and all my notebooks would have disappeared.</p>
<p>I went through all kinds of experiences. My life is full of aspiration, renunciation and also some peculiar experiences.</p>
<p>It was God’s Will for my notebooks to be saved. Otherwise, would my brother have come home at eight-thirty on that day? There was no rhyme or reason for his early arrival. He said, “A voice within me was telling me that something was going wrong, something very serious was happening.” Something very serious was happening in my life: that was my brother’s feeling, so he came home to see what was wrong. How can I forget this experience!</p>
