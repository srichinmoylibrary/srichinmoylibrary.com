<p>I first tried lifting 300 pounds on May 23rd and I eventually succeeded on August 11th, after 80 days. It was my 214th attempt. Then I tried 313 pounds. I began on August 12th and I did it on August l9th — eight days later. Then I jumped to 320 pounds, which was double my body weight. I started the morning of August 21st, Agraha’s birthday, and I did it the afternoon of that same day. At his request I did it. Now I need a few more disciples’ birthdays to inspire me. It took a long time to go to 330 pounds — two weeks! But to reach 340 pounds it took only 12 attempts and for 350 ˝ pounds, just eight attempts. So my speed is increasing. I think I am still getting the benefit from attempting 300 pounds for two and a half months.</p>

<p>Absolutely the fastest way to make progress in the inner life is through gratitude. When I look at my 350-pound dumbbell, believe me, perhaps my mind is more frightened than yours! But when I offer my gratitude to the Supreme early in the morning, there is no fear at all.</p>

<p>I enjoy joking with the Germans. This morning I told Shikha, Sutikhna and Minati that Madal Bal has to give me a stronger-than-the-strongest drink so that I can lift up 700 pounds. In this lifetime if you don’t cut jokes, Heaven’s door will not be open for you. Heaven’s door is open only for jokers.</p>

<p>This afternoon Unmilan and others put a dumbbell with 350 pounds on it in front of my house. Next to it they put a calf which also weighed about 350 pounds. They had rented the calf from the zoo. Then they took a picture of me standing next to the weight and the calf. In this way they wanted to show how much weight 350 pounds is.</p>

<p>As you know, my weightlifting has attracted a few critics. When I was trying for my God-realisation, it was only between God and myself. But now that I am trying for God-manifestation, there are some critics.</p>
<p>Ramakrishna told Vivekananda a story about an elephant walking to the market. All around it dogs were barking, but the elephant looked neither to the right nor to the left. It just went straight ahead to the goal.</p>
<p>I was a lion in my last animal incarnation. Bill Pearl was also a lion. So we are two lions who are able to roar. The dogs can bark because the lions are quiet. But if the lions should start to roar, then the dogs will disappear immediately.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The test of faith</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The test of faith" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>There are many times when I say serious things by way of joke. I start with absurd jokes but, in the back of my mind, I know that reality and divinity are being consciously expressed in my joking manner, which almost borders on absurdity.</p>
<p>Two days ago, by way of a real joke — but I am saying that divinity was involved — I asked some disciples in my house how many of them had faith that I would one day be able to lift up 700 pounds with one arm. Most of them were silent, except for one or two. I didn’t want to embarrass them, but the monkey or donkey in me spoke. I said that if they had this kind of faith in my capacity, I would put them in a garbage bag, seal it and throw it out!</p>
<p>If my Beloved Supreme wants to use my right arm to lift up 700 pounds, He will — no matter how little faith my disciples have in me.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Going to 400 pounds</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Going to 400 pounds" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>About three months ago I cried when I tried to lift 300 pounds. Now I am trying to add another 100 pounds and lift 400. Yesterday I started with 360 pounds. Then I shall go to 370, 380, 390 and 400.</p>
<p>Two people who will be really happy when I lift 400 pounds are Bill Pearl and Jim Smith. Jim Smith has predicted that I will do 400 pounds. My brother Chitta does not like predictions or outer promises. So, on the one hand, he will laugh at me for saying I will do 400 pounds; on the other hand, he will be the one to cry and die every day to know if I have done it. Outwardly he will laugh but inwardly he will desperately cry and intensely pray for me to do it. Lately, my sister has been reminding me of my promise to stop after 300 pounds. She has been begging me to stop. My 350 pounds made her very sad.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Celebrating myself</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Celebrating myself" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>This morning I was having breakfast with some of the disciples. Garima was wearing a T-shirt which mentioned my 300-pound lift. It was not an old T-shirt, but 300 pounds is old for me. I was saying that I really wanted my disciples to be able to wear a 400-pound T-shirt in the New York Marathon next month. At the speed I am going, perhaps by then I will have lifted either 380 pounds or 400 pounds. At any rate, it will only be a difference of a few pounds.</p>
<p>While we were talking, I had the idea to buy myself a cake in honour of 400 pounds. It is the first time I have ever bought myself a cake, although I have been given hundreds of cakes by my disciples. When I went to the man to ask him to write “400” on the top, he said: “Let me congratulate you first. I know you are the guy who did 300 pounds.” Then he shook hands with me and asked a few more questions such as which arm I use. The man was very nice. How do these people know about my weightlifting?</p>
<p>Now that I have given myself a cake, I have to do it! Like Walt Whitman, I am celebrating myself.</p>

<p>This morning, when I lifted 360 pounds for the first time, my mother’s soul came. My eyes were wide open and she was facing me. As I was lifting it, she was watching me very seriously, not fearfully but with such seriousness. Was I lifting the weight or was I only looking at my mother? I did not know if she was happy or displeased.</p>
<p>On the fourth attempt — which was my best lift — both my father and my mother came even before I concentrated. This time, my mother was smiling and my father looked very serious. Then they both left.</p>
<p>I never do five lifts in the morning. It is always four. But today, after the fourth lift, I was so happy that I wanted to do another one. O God, I couldn’t do it! This time, my mother and father had gone away. They had no time to wait.</p>
<p>If you see this kind of thing — father and mother — how can you concentrate? You get such joy, it either ruins your concentration or you get extra energy.</p>

<p>This morning, as I was about to lift 370 pounds for the third time, whom did I see? My departed disciples Agni and Ananta standing side by side. Ananta was holding the flag, as usual, and Agni was clapping.</p>
<p>Now, do I ever see Hanuman? On my fourth lift, all of a sudden, he came. Poor Agni and Ananta! As soon as they saw Hanuman’s tail, they were so frightened that they disappeared. When Hanuman comes, his tail resembles a lion and that is why they were so frightened.</p>
<p>Here I was lifting 370 pounds, but inside I was in a laughing consciousness because Agni and Ananta ran away.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">It happened to be my car</h2><span property="dc:title" content="It happened to be my car" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Our philosophy is self-transcendence. Two days ago, I lifted a car with my calves. At that time, no human beings were sitting in the car. Today, again, I wanted to lift a car. This time it happened to be my car. When some of the disciples bought me the car, they told me it was gold. But when I got it, I saw that it was brown. The weight of the car is 2,960 pounds and the apparatus for lifting it is 82 pounds. So, altogether 3,042 pounds were loaded onto the machine.</p>
<p>I lifted the car twice. Then, on the third lift, Ranjana, Unmilan and Vinaya were inside the car. The weight on the calf machine was 3,521 Ľ pounds. On the fourth lift, five persons were inside. The car and the weight came to 3,811 ľ pounds. On the fifth lift, seven persons and the car totalled 4,107 pounds.</p>
<p>On the sixth lift — this one really killed me — four persons were in the front seat, four were in the back seat and three were on top of the car. There were eleven people altogether. The weight came to 4,515 ˝ pounds. I have no idea scientifically how much I actually lifted. Our great mathematicians and physicists are working it out. I lifted the 4,515 ˝ pounds twice and held it for around seven seconds. Luckily, I am still alive. Now I shall take rest from the car lift for a long time, because I really suffered a lot.</p>

<p>While I was lifting the car with the disciples sitting inside it, I was not even in the human world; I was in the inner world. When I was about to do my sixth lift — the car plus eleven disciples sitting inside and on the trunk — I was clearly seeing Bill Pearl’s soul next to me. The soul said to me, “It is too much, too much!”</p>
<p>I said to the soul, “I know, I know. But please help me!”</p>
<p>Then his soul said, “Definitely.”</p>
<p>After I lifted the car and eleven disciples, I soulfully thanked Bill Pearl’s soul for its help and the soul made the comment, “Stupendous!”</p>
<p>Then I did exactly the same thing again. This time, the soul was so amazed that it was absolutely speechless.</p>

<p>This morning, when I was trying to lift 380 pounds, my dearest friend Jyotish, who died a long time ago of leukemia, came to watch me from the soul’s world.</p>
<p>Then, on my third lift, I saw Ganapati, the elephant god who is also known as Ganesh. As a matter of fact Ganesh is my astrological name. By coincidence, Jyotish means “astrologer.” Ganapati and Jyotish have a very close connection in the inner world. Ganapati is the one who gives realisation. So in India, before you do any puja, first you have to bow to Ganapati. When Ganapati came to watch me, He occupied the entire wall on my right hand side and His huge elephant trunk was moving all around.</p>

<p>When I was lifting at the tennis court this morning, Dhananjaya took so many pictures. But when I was lifting with the heaviest people — Amayik, Byron, Sahishnu and others — at that time he was so amazed that he didn’t take any pictures. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>He came up to me and said, “Can you forgive me?”</p>
<p>But he had taken so many other excellent pictures before that.</p>
