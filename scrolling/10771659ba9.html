  <h2 id="page-title">The United Nations</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The United Nations" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Clearly, pointedly and illuminingly Einstein told the world what the actual role of the United Nations is: <em>“The United Nations now and world government eventually must serve one single goal — the guarantee of the security, the tranquility and the welfare of all mankind.”</em> Here the scientist proved that he was something more than a scientist, more than a philosopher, more than an intellectual — indeed, a true possessor of wisdom-tower. The hopes and dreams he had for the United Nations will most assuredly turn into realities some day.</p>
<p>His seeker-heart declared: <em>“We are convinced that the United Nations will be able to develop into a world government only when the Assembly is no longer composed of delegates appointed by governments, but, instead, of representatives elected directly by the people. Only in this way will the delegates serve the interests of supranational order and security according to their own best judgement.”</em></p>
<p>Again: <em>“The extension of the United Nations, to encompass possibly all countries, will create a better basis for disarmament negotiations; hence efforts to increase membership should precede any attempt to solve the problem of disarmament.”</em></p>
<p>Sooner than at once he appreciated the goodness and wisdom in others. In his journey towards the supreme goal of oneness, he appreciated and admired all his fellow travellers who dreamt of one world, one home and one heart. To Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Einstein wrote: <em>“You are one of the very few who, in the midst of the bewilderment and confusion of our time, has succeeded in keeping his vision clear, and whose urge to be of constructive help remains undeterred by obstacles and narrow allegiances.... I am one of the many whose thoughts accompany you with gratitude and hope.”</em></p>
<p>In Einstein the world saw a man of spontaneity, a man of sincerity who cared for world-progress more than anything else. It was not who did something, but that the thing was done that he considered of paramount importance. Again, when he saw the doer, he admired him unreservedly for his unparalleled achievement. After hearing a talk by United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, Einstein wrote: <em>“I cannot refrain from expressing my sincere admiration for your address on the occasion of the Columbia University Bicentennial Celebration. In the wake of so much mendacity and hypocrisy, your lucid and honest remarks were a welcome relief. I consider it fortunate that a man such as yourself has been entrusted with the most important and difficult position which you now occupy.”</em></p>
<p>Dag Hammarskjold replied, “It was my intention to present a vigorous and unequivocal declaration on behalf of those ideals and principles that constitute the only possible background and the only possible atmosphere for the work of a man who, like you, is one of the pioneers of mankind…. It is a truly deep satisfaction for me to know that you not only understand what I tried to communicate to the large audience… but that you also approve of what I said. Such understanding, especially coming from you, is meaningful to me beyond words.”</p>
<p>These two immortals sailed in the same boat Their admiration was not mere admiration, but the manifestation of oneness-life from their oneness-soul.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>1.</h2>

<p>To analyse is to misjudge a soul. To love is to fathom a soul’s depth. Analysis takes place in the mental world, which is often frequented by the hooligans doubt and deception.</p>
<p>A genius always stands far beyond the reach of the common run. He is far above us, yet he is always for us. Einstein’s wife, Elsa, offered a world of illumination to her husband’s critics and dear ones alike when she said: <em>“You cannot analyse him, otherwise you will misjudge him. Such a genius should be irreproachable in every respect. But no, nature doesn’t behave like this. Where she goes extravagantly, she takes away extravagantly. You have to see him all of one piece. You cannot put him under one heading or another heading. Otherwise, you have unpleasantness. God has given him so much nobility, and I find him wonderful, although life with him is exhausting and complicated, and not only in one way, but in others.”</em></p>
<p>Unprecedented was Elsa’s service to her scientist-husband. She rightly deserves the loftiest appreciation for her endless and sleepless devotion to him. No wonder a friend of theirs lovingly voiced forth: “Your Elsa guards the mortal that the immortal may live.” Needless to say, Einstein unreservedly saw eye to eye with his friend.</p>
<p>At times it is quite difficult for an individual to get appreciation from his dear ones and from the immediate members of his family because of their demanding nature and their expectations, founded upon familiarity. But to our great joy, Einstein’s daughter-in-law, Hans’ wife, tells the world what she saw in the scientist: <em>“Dr. Einstein has been the sweetest, kindest, most understanding father-in-law any woman could have, he is a good and wonderful man.”</em></p>

<p>The scientist-sage had genuine love for India. He also had tremendous admiration for the Indian leaders who were the fate-makers of India, like Gandhi and Nehru. Einstein deeply appreciated and soulfully admired Gandhi’s non-violence movement. In his study he cherished a drawing of Gandhi, a striking reminder that the soul-power is infinitely superior to military power. To his family he read aloud Gandhi’s autobiography. The soul-power, which is inner freedom, eventually brings about outer freedom as well. Einstein’s heart and mind were fully convinced of this supreme truth.</p>
<p>India is the harbinger of inner peace. India is the pioneer of inner heart’s inner oneness. The scientist felt it in the very depth of his heart. He himself was a staunch supporter of peace. He himself cared for peace more than anything else, both in national life and in international life. His heart-door and his house-door were wide open to the Indians. This singular gesture was not meant for all other nationalities.</p>
<p>Once an interview took place between Einstein and India’s Ambassador to the United States, Gaganvihari Mehta. At the very outset the Ambassador said to the scientist, <em>“I have come to invite you to attend a science conference in India as an honoured guest of our country.”</em></p>
<p>Einstein’s immediate response was both sorrowful and soulful: <em>“Both because of my health and my age I must decline, but it is with regret, for I have a deep regard for the of people of India and for Prime Minister Nehru.”</em></p>
<p>During the interview at one point the Indian Ambassador struck a note of similarity between Gandhi and Einstein. Softly, humbly, unhesitatingly and sagaciously said the scientist, <em>“Don’t, please, compare me with Gandhi. He did so much for humanity. What have I done? There is nothing unusual about discovering a few scientific formulas.”</em></p>

<p>Two immortals: Tagore and Einstein. During their memorable interview at Einstein’s place in Berlin, both of them unfortunately had to enjoy a difference of opinions. True indeed is the saying, “Many minds, many ways."</p>
<p>“This world,” said Tagore, “is a human world. The scientific view of it is only that of the scientific man. Therefore, the world apart from us humans does not exist, it is a relative world, depending for its reality upon our consciousness. There is a standard of reason which gives it truth — the standard of the eternal man, whose experiences are made possible through our experiences.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s comment: <em>“I agree with the conception of beauty as being inseparable from man, but I do not agree with this conception as pertaining to truth.”</em></p>
<p>“Why not?” enquired Tagore “Truth is realised through man.”</p>
<p>After a long pause, Einstein replied very quietly and softly: <em>“I cannot prove my conception is right, but that is my religion.”</em></p>
<p>At the end of the journeys close, each individual is entitled to reach his destination according to his inner experiences and outer manifestations. The approaches of these two unique individuals to the reality-world were strikingly different, but needless to say both of them, from two different angles, will eventually arrive at the self-same goal: oneness-satisfaction and satisfaction-perfection.</p>

<p>Only an enlightened soul knows another enlightened soul. On the strength of their inner awareness, inner oneness and inner cry for humanity’s goal, they disclose to the world what true wisdom is, who embodies it and how it can be achieved. India’s Prime Minister Nehru saw that the emperor-scientist was the wisest and greatest man. When Einstein died, Nehru sadly reflected, <em>“The wisest and greatest man among us has passed away. Not for many years will we fully appreciate that wisdom and greatness. But he has tried to show us the way. Those who have the responsibility for leading nations have a tendency to think only of their own societies. But Albert Einstein has been telling us that we can no longer live in separate worlds. It is that concept of a unified world which all of us — leaders and citizens — must now create and serve.”</em></p>
<p>Einstein’s supreme height was expressed eloquently and unmistakably by a colleague of his in Berlin, Professor Ladenburg, who said, <em>“There were two kinds of physicists in Berlin. On the one hand was Einstein, on the other all the rest.”</em> Indeed, Einstein had a huge boat, while other scientists had to be satisfied with rafts.</p>
<p>President Eisenhower, the indomitable soul born in a freedom-loving country, frankly, unreservedly and convincingly offered his personal opinion about the founder of the atomic age: <em>“No other man contributed so much to the vast expansion of twentieth-century knowledge.”</em></p>
<p>Einstein’s physical death prompted this immortal utterance from the supreme cellist, Pablo Casals: “After Einstein’s death it is as if the world has lost a part of its substance.” Pablo Casals again offered his gratitude-flowers to the supreme scientist when he said, “I was perpetually grateful to him for his protest against the injustice to which my homeland was sacrificed.”</p>
<p>What the supreme playwright George Bernard Shaw said about the supreme scientist should be imprinted in letters of gold in the hearts of all creation-loving and Creator-fulfilling humans: “There are great men who are great among small men. There are great men who are great among great men, and that is the sort of man that we are honouring tonight. Napoleon and other great men of his type were makers of Empire. But there is an order of man who gets beyond that. They are makers of universes…”</p>
