<p><em>(Akbar's palace.)</em></p>
<p>AKBAR: Tansen, how it is that you cannot play so well? Your master lives in a poor cottage, whereas you have all kinds of advantages and opportunities. Even then you cannot play as well as he. I appreciate your sincerity in telling me that he plays far better than you do, but I cannot account for this. Why is it? What prevents you from playing as well as he does?</p>
<p>TANSEN: O Emperor, I play for you, for human beings; I play for name and fame; I play for wealth. My teacher plays for God, the Lord Supreme. For him, there is only God. God is everything. I want to please human beings who live in the world of human pleasure; he wants to please the Absolute Supreme. When one plays for the world, one gets what he wants: appreciation, admiration, flattery. But when one plays for God, the Absolute, one gets God's boundless Grace, His boundless Blessing and Transcendental Delight. God, the Infinite Compassion, enters into his music and, at every moment, he plays celestial, transcendental, soul-stirring music-music that awakens the Universal Consciousness, music that feeds the Universal Consciousness, music that manifests the Universal Consciousness in aspiring souls.</p>
<p>AKBAR: Tansen, you are a great musician, but your sincerity is greater than your music. Your inner depth is by far the greatest. Your inner wisdom is by far the best. I bow to your music with love. I bow to your sincerity with joy. I bow to your inner wisdom with my heart's gratitude.</p>

<p><em>(The abode of Prajapati. Enter three students for spiritual instruction: a cosmic god, a man and an asura. Prajapati is highly pleased to see them.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Please sit here in front of me. <em>(All bow and are seated.)</em> What can I do for you three? Why have you come to me?</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: We have come here for spiritual instruction. We have come here to learn from you that which will really make us great and fulfil our lives.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Wonderful, wonderful! I shall teach you. But you have to stay here for some time. Then one day I shall invite you to come before me, and I shall give you spiritual instruction, my divine advice. <em>(All bow to Prajapati with deep gratitude.)</em> But first of all, I wish to know if you have any special desire, something that you feel you need most in your life. Mind you, this has nothing to do with your spiritual instruction. It is just something I want to know, you can say, out of curiosity. I want to know what each one of you has as your greatest desire.</p>
<p>ASURA: O greatest of all sages, O peerless sage. I want to conquer the world with my vital power. I want to lord it over the world. I want to prove to the world at large that I am the greatest and most powerful here on earth and there in Heaven.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Ah, that is a splendid wish! <em>(Turning toward the man.)</em> Now, what about your desires?</p>
<p>MAN: O Creator, O Father of the entire universe, my sole desire is to become one with your whole creation. With my heart's pure, soulful love, I want to become inseparably one with your entire creation — totally one with each human being, with each creature, with each object that you have created here on earth.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: That is a splendid idea! Indeed, it is a splendid wish. <em>(Turning toward the god.)</em> And what do you want most in your life?</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: O Absolute, O sage of the highest magnitude, O peerless one, O transcendental one, I wish to illumine the universe with my soul's Light. I wish to illumine your entire creation with my soul's divine Light.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Indeed, that is a marvelous desire! <em>(To all.)</em> I have three rooms here — one for each of you. Every day you will be served food in your rooms, and you will spend all your time in meditation. I shall call you when I feel that you are ready to receive my instruction.</p>

<p>ASURA: I know I can easily become the most powerful being both in Heaven and on earth. I know I have that capacity. I am not bragging, I tell you. What I say is just a mere fact.</p>
<p>MAN: I know that I can be the most loving person on earth. My heart has the capacity to love everyone and everything on earth. I know I shall do it. God has given me the most loving heart, and I shall utilise it; I shall offer it to serve Him in His creation.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: I know I shall be able to illumine the whole world with my soul's Light. God has given me that capacity, and He wants me to use it to illumine His creation. I will do it, and when I have done it, I will see God's Face brimming with transcendental Delight, for my success is undoubtedly His success.</p>

<p><em>(The three students come before Prajapati and bow to him.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Today it is time for me to give you my spiritual instruction, my divine advice. I wish to advise each of you separately. We will start with the god. <em>(The god bows to Prajapati.)</em> Now tell me, what kind of advice do you actually want from me?</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: O Prajapati, you know what is best for me. I want my life to be really fruitful, meaningful and soulful.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: <em>Da. (On hearing this the god is struck with confusion.)</em> It seems that you have not understood my instruction. Go over there for a while and meditate on what I have said. Come back when you have understood my advice. We shall meditate here until you return.</p>
<p><em>(The god bows to Prajapati and moves away, out of their sight. The other three meditate together.)</em></p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: I don't understand it. I thought he would give me some special teaching, something that would illumine me all at once so that I could illumine the world. But what he has said, I do not understand at all. Let me meditate on it ... <em>(Meditates)</em> Ah, I have found the answer.</p>
<p><em>(The god rushes back to Prajapati.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: So, you have understood what I said?</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: Yes, my Lord, I have understood.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Then tell me.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD <em>(with folded hands):</em> You want me to lead a most disciplined life; you want me to control all my senses. You want me to live a life of total discipline and perfect Perfection.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI <em>(overjoyed):</em> Yes, my child, you have understood my advice; you have understood my philosophy. <em>(To the man.)</em> Now it is your turn. <em>(The man comes with folded hands.)</em> Tell me what you actually want. What kind of advice do you need?</p>
<p>MAN: My Lord, I want you to tell me how I can feel that my life has special meaning on earth. I want to lead a life of happiness and fulfillment. This is all that I want.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: <em>Da. (The man is totally confused. He cannot make anything out of it.)</em> Ah, I know it is difficult for you. Now you can move away from here for a little while and meditate on what I have said, and come back when you have understood it. It may take a little while, but we shall wait for you here.</p>
<p><em>(The man bows to Prajapati and goes aside. Prajapati, the god and the asura meditate together.)</em></p>
<p>MAN <em>(from a distance!)</em> I will never understand this Prajapati. Just one word — <em>Da.</em> What does he mean? What does he actually mean? What does he want me to understand? I thought he would tell me something very deep and secret, something sacred that would give me all joy, all satisfaction, all perfection, all at once. Instead of doing that, he just says <em>Da.</em> I can make neither head nor tail of it. Anyway, let me meditate on <em>Da</em> and if I get any answer, I will go back to him . . . <em>(Meditates.)</em> Aah, I have found the answer!</p>
<p><em>(The man rushes back to Prajapati.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: It seems you have found the answer; you have understood my advice. Now tell me what you have learned.</p>
<p>MAN: Ah, my Lord, at long last I have understood what you meant. You want me to give everything that I have and everything that I am. All that I have and all that I am you want me to give away freely, soulfully, devotedly and unconditionally to the world at large. Am I correct?</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI <em>(joyfully):</em> Right, you are absolutely correct, absolutely correct, my son; you have understood my advice; you have understood my philosophy. <em>(To the asura.)</em> Come up, please. <em>(The asura comes before him and bows with folded hands.)</em> Your two friends have understood my philosophy. I am sure you will also easily understand my philosophy: But before I teach you, I would like to ask you what you actually want. Is there anything specific that you need from me which will really help you in every way?</p>
<p>ASURA: My Lord, I want you to decide on my behalf. I don't know what will actually make me the most powerful and the happiest being at the same time. Please, make me the happiest and the most powerful.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: Indeed, that is a splendid desire. Now here is my advice — <em>Da.</em></p>
<p>ASURA: Confusion, all confusion! You have thrown me into a sea of confusion! I do not know what it all means.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: O my son, do not be disturbed, do not be confused. Like these two, you can also move away from here and meditate on it for a while. I am sure you will understand my advice. And when you get the answer, come back to me. In the meantime, we shall meditate here.</p>
<p><em>(The asura bows to Prajapati with folded hands and moves away.)</em></p>
<p>ASURA <em>(from a distance):</em> What does this old man mean? This old man has no sense. I came to him for power, only power. If he had given me advice on how to acquire boundless power, I would have been the happiest person on earth. Here, there, everywhere I want to be the Lord, the Lord Supreme. I want the whole world to be at my feet, but he didn't understand me; he didn't feel my heart's desire. Now I am all confused. He has simply thrown me into a sea of confusion, this old man. I thought he would at least use some Sanskrit phrases, some mantras. They say that in Sanskrit mantras there is tremendous power. I would repeat them millions of times in order to get power. But he didn't use any. I thought that he would ask me to repeat a particular portion of the scriptures, but he didn't do that. I thought that he would disclose some secret and, with that secret, I would be able to lord it over the whole world, and make the world touch the dust of my feet. But alas, he just said <em>Da.</em> I am helpless and I am hopeless. I came to him for help, but I am helpless with what he has said to me. Anyway, what can I do? This is my fate, my deplorable fate. Let me meditate on his stupid word, <em>Da. (Meditates.)</em> Aah, I have understood, I have understood! It is so easy, so easy!</p>
<p><em>(The asura runs to Prajapati.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: So, you have understood my philosophy, I am sure. Tell me about it.</p>
<p>ASURA <em>(with folded hands):</em> I have understood the depth of your philosophy. It means that I must be compassionate, be affectionate, be full of concern all the time. Am I correct?</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI <em>(overjoyed):</em> You are absolutely correct, my child. You have understood the very depth of my philosophy. Be compassionate. Let your outer being and inner being be full of compassion. In all that you say, in all that you do, show only compassion, a flood of compassion. Only then, here on earth and there in Heaven, will everybody appreciate you, admire you and adore you. Be a sea of limitless compassion. <em>(To all.)</em> O cosmic god, O man, O asura, I am satisfied with your understanding of my spiritual instruction. Go back to your homes and, from now on, do the things that you have learned. O asura, use your compassion as power. O man, use your love as power. O cosmic god, use your illumination, your Light, as power. Asura, your compassion is your boundless power. Man, your love is your infinite power. Cod, your Light is your transcendental power. When you three work together my Dream becomes my Reality, and my Dream-Boat touches the Golden Shore of the ever-transcending Beyond. It is you three who can manifest me, fulfil me and make me feel that my creation is something of which I can be eternally proud. Only your loving concern for me, your total dedication to me, your constant oneness with me can make my creation and cosmic manifestation Divine, immortal and Perfect. You will make my world a land of Beauty, a land of Light and Delight, a land of Love, a land of Compassion, a land of Illumination, a land of Perfection and a land of absolute Fulfilment. You can do it, and you must do it. Once it is done, I, the Creator, will dance with highest pride and deepest gratitude.</p>
<p><em>(The three students bow.)</em></p>
<p>MAN: We shall do it, we shall do it. We shall please you, we shall fulfil you, we shall be your most chosen instruments. Through us you will manifest yourself on Earth.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: In us and through us you will offer your Light to Heaven.</p>
<p>ASURA: O Prajapati, we are of you and we are for you.</p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: My children, you three are of me, you three are for me. From now on I will be nothing but a garland of gratitude if you fulfil my desire, my aspiration, my realisation.</p>
<p>ASURA: O Prajapati, we shall do it, we shall do it, we shall do it! With your boundless Light, with your boundless Love, with your boundless Compassion, we shall do it.</p>
<p>MAN: You are ours and we are yours. Forever we shall take part in your cosmic <em>Lila</em> and fulfil you here, there, everywhere. Today, tomorrow, eternally, we shall work together. Together we shall be in your heart to love you, to please you, to fulfil you. Together we shall play with you, sing with you, dance with you.</p>
<p>COSMIC GOD: Together we shall run toward the highest Goal, which is You, You the eternal Reality, the everlasting, the ever-fulfilling, the ever-illumining Reality.</p>
<p><em>(Prajapati blesses his students with tearful gratitude.)</em></p>
<p>PRAJAPATI: I offer you not only my gratitude but all my pride, because in you I have found three most worthy students.</p>
<p>THE THREE STUDENTS: We offer you our deepest gratitude, deepest love, deepest adoration; everything that is divine in us. In you we have found our Haven, our Goal.</p>

<p><em>(The home of a great Master. Enter his disciple, who is also a Guru.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, Master, I need your blessing.</p>
<p>MASTER: Blessing? What for?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: O Master, you know that the King has been bothering me for a long time. He wants me to initiate him. He says he is an old man and may die at any moment, so he needs initiation. Yesterday I finally agreed to do it. I told him that I would this evening initiate him. Now I have come here for your blessing, Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: You fool! How can you initiate the King? Don't you know that he has been wallowing in the pleasures of ignorance all his life? He has led an absolutely corrupt life, and you want to initiate him? Does he have one iota of purity or sincerity, not to speak of spirituality? How can you dare to initiate him? I can't bless you. Go and initiate him. It is your problem.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, he pleaded with me on so many occasions that this time I could not refuse. What shall I do now?</p>
<p>MASTER: Do whatever you like. You have to pay the penalty for your foolishness. And it is not only foolishness. There is also a subtle ego, an unconscious ego involved, which you have not noticed.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, I didn't know anything about that ego. How has it attacked me?</p>
<p>MASTER: My son, you won't like to hear this, but I know you will understand. When you initiate the King, everybody will come to learn about it and they will think, "What a great spiritual Master he is." You will become famous overnight, and there, I tell you, your spiritual progress will end.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Master, Master, save me, save me! If I don't initiate him, the King will punish me; and if I do initiate him, my spiritual life will be ruined. What am I going to do, Master? Please help me. I am at your feet.</p>
<p>MASTER: Go and initiate the King and then come back to me. Let me see what I can do for you.</p>

<p>[O Yogi of the highest magnitude, initiate me. Today offer me your initiation.<br /> Today I shall learn the immortal message of transformation from you.<br /> I shall not wander anymore in the farthest corners of the world.<br /> I shall only dance in the city of my heart.<br /> Inside the city of my heart I shall sing songs of Love Divine,<br /> And I shall see myself in the mirror of my sanctified heart.<br /> Today I beg of you to offer me only one thing: silence, silence.<br /> O Yogi of the highest magnitude, initiate me today.]</p>

<p><em>(The King touches his feet.)</em></p>
<p>KING: You have taken all my impurity, all my imperfections. In return I give you my whole Kingdom and all its wealth. Anything you want from me is yours. O Guru, I am at your command. My royal family is at your command. My subjects are at your command. And all my possessions are at your command.</p>
<p>GURU: O King, from now on I expect you to lead a spiritual life, a divine life. From your example, your Kingdom will begin a new life, a life of purity, a life of renunciation, a life of divine perfection.</p>
<p>KING: Guru, I know, I know. I am most grateful to you for initiating me. I was not worthy of being initiated, but from now on, through my acts, I shall prove to you that I can be what you want me to be, and I shall not betray your trust.</p>
<p><em>(The King sings.)</em></p>

<p><em>Jagiyachhe bishwanath asundar prane</em><br /><em>Chalilam shashwater ahana sandhane</em></p>


<p>[The Lord of the Universe is awakened inside the heart of ugliness itself.<br /> Now towards the Eternal Dawn I march, I run towards the Eternal Dawn.]</p>

<p><em>(The King's Guru comes to his own Master.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: So? You are becoming famous now. Unconsciously you wanted name and fame, and it shall soon be yours. Thousands and thousands of people will come to know about you and a great many will want to become disciples of the King's Guru. You have no idea what you have done to your spiritual life. You have taken boundless impurity, ugliness, filth, ignorance and inconscience from the King. You have fallen, you have fallen. You have fallen far beyond your imagination.</p>
<p><em>(The disciple touches the Master's feet.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Oh Master, forgive me, forgive me. Please purify me.</p>
<p>MASTER: There is only one way you can be forgiven.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Tell me, please. I will do anything.</p>
<p>MASTER: Get a large sign and write on it: "I am fallen, I am fallen. By initiating the King, I am fallen." Write it down. <em>(The disciple gets a sign and writes it down.)</em> In bold letters.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Yes, Master.</p>
<p>MASTER: Now tie it around your neck with some string. <em>(The disciple does it.)</em> Now you must walk around the city and let everyone see what you've done.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: Oh Master, if the citizens see this, what will happen to me? The King's anger will know no bounds. He will punish me severely.</p>
<p>MASTER: I know, I know. The King will arrest you, the King will punish you, the King will do everything. But if you want to be forgiven by God, then you have to do it. Only by being sincere and truthful will you be forgiven.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: What you say is true. I am going. I shall walk along the street with this confession draped around my neck.</p>

<p><em>(The King in his palace. Enter a minister.)</em></p>
<p>MINISTER: Your Majesty, do you know what your Guru is doing? He is walking around the streets mocking you. He is wearing a sign around his neck which says: "I am fallen, I am fallen. By initiating the King, I am fallen."</p>
<p><em>(The King becomes furious.)</em></p>
<p>KING: What! What an insult! First he initiates me and then he laughs at me, telling the world that I am corrupt and useless! He shall see the power of my anger! Have him arrested.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Minister. In a few minutes the King's Guru is brought in.)</em></p>
<p>KING: What kind of audacity do you cherish? What kind of stupidity do you enjoy? Your insolence knows no bounds!</p>
<p>GURU: O King, I am helpless. I too have a Master, and because I initiated you my Master is totally disgusted with me. He says that you did not deserve initiation, that only a spiritual person, a sincere seeker can be initiated. You have done countless wrong things. You have led an undivine, unspiritual life, and I initiated you before you were actually ready for spiritual life. That is why my Master is furious with me. He said that only if I acknowledge my mistake by wearing this sign will God forgive me.</p>
<p>KING: So it is your Master who is causing me this disgrace! That rogue! I knew you were a sincere man, a good man. You would not have caused me such embarrassment. Your Master will be arrested and you will be freed. Your Master will be thrown into my deepest dungeon and left there for the rest of his life. (To Minister.) Minister, have my Guru's Master arrested and brought here immediately!</p>
<p><em>(In a few minutes the Master is brought before the King.)</em></p>
<p>KING: Aaah, you fool, you rogue, you rascal! What embarrassment you have caused me! How you have disgraced my royal family and my dear subjects! You know what you have done! I will not waste a moment more on you. You shall spend the rest of your life in prison.</p>
<p><em>(The disciple-Guru bursts into tears.)</em></p>
<p>GURU: Oh no, oh no. It is impossible. Oh King, it is I who have initiated you, and it is I who should pay the penalty. Let me remain in prison for the rest of my life, but don't punish my Master. He has hundreds and thousands of disciples. They will be fatherless.</p>
<p>KING: Let his disciples be fatherless! He has made me an object of ridicule. He has mocked me, as though I were some insignificant creature. This is <em>my</em> Kingdom, this <em>is my</em> world. And I sentence him to lifelong imprisonment.</p>

<p><em>(One week later. The King's Guru has been fasting to protest his Master's imprisonment. He is visiting his Master in jail.)</em></p>
<p>MASTER: Since I am eating, you should also eat.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: No, until I can bring about your release, I will not eat. It is I who have been the cause of your suffering. It is I who deserve punishment. If I had not initiated the King, he would have punished me. But by initiating him, I have involved you in the picture, and now I shall not rest until I have saved you.</p>
<p>MASTER: No, I involved myself. When you came to me I could have said to you, "Yes, it is a splendid idea. You have done the right thing." But I told you that it was wrong of you to initiate the King. It is my fault that I am here. I should have kept silent.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: How could you have kept silent? When your spiritual son does something wrong it is your duty to correct him, to perfect him. It is through this humiliation that I can enter into the domain of perfection. How could you have ignored me, how could you have been indifferent to me? You did the right thing, you did your duty. You showed me your utmost concern and for that I am most grateful. <em>(The Master smiles.)</em> I shall not leave you here. I shall fast unto death, if need be.</p>
