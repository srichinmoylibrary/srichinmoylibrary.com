<p>I admire New York. My eyes are enamoured of her soul's dynamic beauty. My New York is always astir and bustling. Also is she marching in gigantic strides. Success emerges before her very eyes.</p>
<p>The dawn breaks in to feel New York's heart consumed with new zeal. She hates to be absorbed in a fog of fruitless brooding, empty inactivity. Moreover she wants to be free, eternally free. Never, within her four corners, will she tolerate the air of captivity. If it is part of her nature to express herself boldly, I cannot blame her. Firstly, to me, she deserves this acme of self-confidence. Secondly, God wants New York to be what she is.</p>
<p>My New York has courage. My New York has confidence. The problems of anxiety and uncertainty may cover the length and breadth of the world, but my New York is an exception. Her youthful certainty is my heart's delight.</p>
<p>When I think of my India, it seems that she has endless time. If she does not avail herself of an opportunity today, it will return to her tomorrow. But when I think of New York, it seems that she is facing a unique opportunity at every moment. If she loses a golden opportunity today, it will never return. New York knows how to seize. She knows how to struggle. She knows how to push forward. She knows how to exert herself, consciously and dynamically. Blessed is she. Old blunders fail to plague her. Empty of fear is her heart which ever grows into the fulfilment of her promising future. Blessed is she.</p>
<p>My New York is not a challenge. She is not competition. She is not a running race. She is not victory. What then is she? She is a great Promise, wherein grows and flowers the Infinite Unknown.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Does the soul cry when it is unhappy?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. The real soul which is a portion of the Cosmic Self is all Delight. Since it cannot be unhappy in the human sense of the term, it does not cry. It is the unsatisfied and demanding vital, which we often take for the soul, that suffers unhappiness and cries pitifully.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Each thing and each place has a soul. Like all other cities, the city of New York has its soul. The Supreme has graciously shown me the soul of New York City a number of times. The difference between the soul of things and the souls of humans is a difference in their degree of evolution, in the degree they manifest their divine potentialities. It is through the process of reincarnation that the soul gradually manifests its hidden powers within, that the soul eventually reaches its absolute Fulfilment.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. The earth represents the Mother aspect of the Divine. It is on earth that matter and spirit will find their absolute fulfilment in their reciprocal help and complete union. Matter will see through the eye of the spirit's vision. Spirit will flower by awakening and energising matter to become a perfect basis of physical immortality and human transformation on earth. The two main characteristics of the soul of the earth are Aspiration and Compassionate Tolerance.</p>

That is, can the soul become stronger by the right use of the body such as exercise, right food, etc.?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly. The gross can and must help the subtle. The body is gross, but in its sound and perfect condition, it helps the mind and the subtle existence considerably. One cannot, of course, make the soul stronger merely by taking vigorous physical exercises or by eating judiciously. But if the body, that is, the physical consciousness, aspires to grow in the light of the soul and tries to fulfil the Divine in the physical itself, then the progress of the soul becomes easier, faster and more fulfilling.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Normally it is the soul that determines the experiences that the individual will have in his lifetime. As a matter of fact, if the individual consciously puts himself into spontaneous flow of the experiences that the soul wants to give him, he will eventually grow into abiding peace, joy and fulfilment. Unfortunately, the individual, being a victim of ignorance, is not aware of the soul's selection of the experience, or, in spite of knowing, does not care for the selection made by the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is in the heart. According to medical science, the heart is slightly to the left of the center of the chest. According to Ramana Maharshi, the great sage of Arunachala, it is slightly to the right of the center. Some spiritual figures say that the heart is in the middle of the chest. Again, according to another spiritual figure, the heart is placed between the eyebrows! Of course, he also has his reasons.</p>
<p>The true spiritual heart, four finger-breadths in width, is located twelve finger-breadths directly above the navel and six finger-breadths directly below the center of the neck. It is here that one feels the "quickening" of the soul.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The Katha Upanishad says that the body is the chariot, the soul is the master of the chariot, the Intellect is the charioteer and the mind the reins.</p>
<p>I am happy to answer this particular question. You are the landlady of the building in which we have our Centre. You own this building. We are your tenants. We are all newcomers. You try your best to satisfy our requirements. Nevertheless, some of the tenants, not all, make your life a hell. Their demands are at times outrageous and absurd. Further, they cherish an uncompromising attitude. What do you do then? I believe you become quite helpless, if not hopeless. In spite of the fact that it is you who own this building. It is not easy to drive away the disturbing, demanding, uncompromising tenants at once. Similar is the fate of the soul which is attacked by the pleasure-seeking, demanding and unaspiring newcomer, the personality.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">What is the aim of life?</h2><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><span property="dc:title" content="What is the aim of life?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>The aim of life is to be conscious of the Supreme Reality. The aim of life is to be the conscious expression of the Eternal Being.</p>
<p>Life is evolution. Evolution is the unfoldment from within. Each life is a world in itself. Indeed, each life is a microcosm. Whatever breathes in the vast universe also breathes in it.</p>
<p>There are two lives: the inner and the outer. The outer life speaks about its principles and then tries to act. It professes in season and out of season. It practises very little of what it professes. The inner life acts. It does not speak. It professes only what it practises.</p>
<p>Our life has two realities: exoteric and esoteric. The exoteric reality deals with the world around us. The esoteric reality deals with the inner world. The outer reality tries to fulfil itself by feeding desires and stimulating passions. The inner reality finds fulfilment by the control of passions and conquest of desires, by swimming in the vast sea of liberation.</p>
<p>Life is existence. The ordinary existence comes from a deeper Existence. Existence cannot come from nonexistence. Life comes from God. Life is God. Two things we should do. We should read life most devotedly and live it most divinely.</p>
<p>Two things we must have: imagination and inspiration. A life with no imagination is a life of imprisonment. With the wings of imagination, we must try to fly into the Beyond. A life with no inspiration is a life of stagnation. With the dynamism of ceaseless inspiration, we shall give a new meaning to life and immortalise life itself.</p>
<p>The aim of life is to realise God. Realisation can never come to the individual who is inactive. One has to strive for realisation. One has to pay the price for it. There is no alternative. One thing of paramount importance is that by telling others that you are a realised soul, you may convince others, you may even deceive your very heart, but you cannot deceive God.</p>
<p>To have Realisation, the first requisite is peace. Peace is based on love: love for humanity and love for God. Peace is also founded on non-attachment. No thirst for gain, no fear of loss — lo, peace is yours. Peace is also based on renunciation. This renunciation is not the renunciation of worldly possessions, but of limitations and ignorance. And that peace is the true peace which is not affected by the roaring of the world, outer or inner.</p>
<p>When you have that kind of peace, realisation cannot help knocking at your heart's door. To be more accurate, the lotus of Realisation will start blooming in your heart, petal by petal. Further, to realise God, temples, churches and synagogues are not obligatory. Neither is the tapestry of scriptures and sermons required. What is imperative is meditation. This meditation will make you realise God the Infinite within your soul, heart, mind and body.</p>
<p>The aim of life is to live a divine life. We are living in this world. We know that man does not live by bread alone. He needs the soul in order to live in the world of God's Reality. The soul alone has the capacity to see and feel the known and the Unknown, the existent and the non-existent, the dream of the past, the achievement of the present, and the hope of the future.</p>
<p>Let us accept the inner life, the spiritual life. Mistakes in our journey are inevitable. Success without endeavour is impossibility itself. No work, no progress. Experience we must welcome, for we can learn nothing without experience. The experience may be either encouraging or discouraging. But it is experience that makes us a real being; it shows us the true meaning of our very existence.</p>
<p>Let us all be truly spiritual. Let us realise God by our constant communion with Him. We need not have any particular time or place for our meditation. We must transcend the necessity of time and space. When we go deep within, we can feel that one moment cannot be separated from another, one place cannot be separated from another. Let us aspire to live in the Eternal Now of God-Realisation, in the Eternal Now of God's Dream and Reality. This Dream is the Dream of ever-surpassing Transcendence. This Reality is the Reality of ever-blossoming Revelation.</p>

<h2>Question: Gurudev, I want to ask you something. If I break an egg, can God put it together again?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly He can. God can do anything He wants.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Can you do it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, sorry Shannon, your Gurudev cannot do it. But if God gives me the power, I can easily do it.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em>Can I do it?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Why not? The moment God gives you the power, you can easily put a broken egg together again. A day will come when you, I and everyone will have the same power that God has now.</p>
