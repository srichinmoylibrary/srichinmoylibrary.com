  <h2 id="page-title">Question: I have no problem in Centre meditations.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: I have no problem in Centre meditations." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> At the Centre I am not bringing down that kind of light. In a public meditation, the whole hall is flooded with my power, with my light. Right now, I am absolutely normal. But when I am in a public meditation, I am a totally different person. There my consciousness is on a very, very high level. At that time if you try to pull beyond your receptivity, then you are in trouble. It is not that others have been bringing negative forces into you. No! So the best thing for you to do is sit at the back. There the power is less, but if you sit in the front row, you suffer because your capacity is very limited. As you increase your capacity, it will become easy for you to receive more. That is why I always say, "Don't pull, don't push."</p>
<p>There is one other thing in your case. You have unconsciously developed a sense of pride, which is the worst thing. I am telling this to all my disciples. Some of you have joined our boat just yesterday, but you are of the opinion that you do better meditation than our older disciples This is absolutely wrong. You have to show respect to those who have come into the family before you. Some of my most recent disciples feel that they are far superior to the older disciples. This is absurd. When you sit beside the older disciples, you should feel that they are your elder brothers. Please feel that this is a family and you are the youngest. Your eldest brothers and sisters know quite a few things far better than you know. So it is not beneath your dignity to learn from your superiors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of you have the feeling that you know far better than they, and if you sit beside them you feel that your aspiration is decreasing because they are inferior. Please do not cherish this kind of false notion. If you cherish this kind of idea, no matter where you meditate, your own superiority complex will ruin your aspiration. When you are with older disciples, you should feel happy and proud that you are able to mix with them. If you have the idea that they are ruining your meditation, that you are entering into <em>nirvikalpa samadhi,</em> and then they are pulling you down, this is absurd, absurd. You should try to be with them in order to learn, and not to make yourself feel that you know better than they. When you are in a group with other people, your problem is that you do not identify yourself with them. On the contrary, there is a kind of unconscious superiority.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> From time to time we will have very long meditations. It is not that I expect all of you to meditate every day for seven hours — impossible. If you try to meditate seven hours a day, you will turn insane. But on certain days we shall invoke special Grace from the Supreme. At these times, only because it is a special day and there is a special force, nothing will happen if you try to meditate for seven hours. Special Light and special Power are coming from above. So on these days if you can meditate for seven hours soulfully, you are bound to receive Peace, Light and Bliss in abundant measure. We are having a seven-hour meditation on my birthday, and my request to all the disciples is that you practise at home and try to lengthen the time that you can meditate. Please try to meditate on weekends or at night, when you don't have anything else to do.</p>
<p>When you come to the meditation on my birthday and find that you cannot meditate well, my request to you is just remain silent. If you get up, then you will only make a noise and disturb the person who is beside you or you will attract the attention of others. They will see you and then, if they remain in the mental world, some of them will inwardly say nasty things about you. Either they will think that you are bothering them, or they will feel sorry for you, because they can meditate for hours whereas you cannot. In this way you will unnecessarily give them the opportunity either to criticise you or sympathise with you. So the best thing to do, if you can't meditate, is to remain in your seat. You can try to sing a few of my songs in silence, or do japa.</p>
<p>If you are tired and exhausted after an hour of meditation, and if I do not say that it is time for a recess, then you have to stay there. And if you feel that this will be impossible then please don't come. That is my request to each of you. If you feel that it is simply impossible for you to stay still after forty-five minutes or an hour, or if you have a serious cold or something that will unnecessarily draw attention, then the best thing is to do me a favour by not coming. I will be most grateful if you can meditate at home.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Then more mental asylums will have to open up. It is not possible. Only spiritual Masters can meditate for hours and days on end. Ordinary seekers have to talk and mix with people; otherwise, they will go crazy. Any individual has to see and talk with others and get an outer vibration. Otherwise, the mind and nerves become very agitated. Then anger comes and also a kind of subtle pride: "I have not talked to people for one whole week." Then they become abnormal.</p>
<p>Meditating twenty-four hours a day is quite possible, but only after you realise God, or when you are on the verge of realisation. At that time, you will have acquired the capacity. So even while you are eating, talking or working in your office, you will see that you are doing your best meditation; you will see that you can do four things at once.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part V — Drowsiness and other problems</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part V — Drowsiness and other problems" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: How does physical pain, illness or an unpleasant experience affect meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you have a headache or stomach upset. Then how will you meditate? In real meditation, the entire being has to aspire. But in my case, I have occult power, so I can sit here and have a 104 degree or 105 degree fever, but when I want to meditate I can go up to my highest height.</p>
<p>Your meditation is also affected when you are angry with someone and you have not illumined your anger. You may have forgotten your anger, but if you have not illumined it, then it will pull you down. You have many unpleasant experiences during the day. A few hours elapse and then you forget the experience. "Forgotten" is the right word, but "forgiven," no. Unless you have forgiven, you have not illumined the anger. Anger is not now coming, but still it has pulled you down seven rungs of your consciousness-ladder even though you have totally forgotten the incident. Sometimes you will quarrel with the members of your family and then you will go to sleep. But the next morning you cannot meditate. You have totally forgotten the incident, but while you were sleeping the strength of the anger increased. The velocity, the speed, the strength of the anger from seven hours ago will be greater. It is just like a swarm of insects that are multiplying like anything. But positive forces increase slowly. So when something has gone wrong, it is better to rectify it and illumine it immediately.</p>
<p>Everything on the physical plane has to be illumined before you meditate. Otherwise, meditation cannot be profound. If one part of your being is not properly balanced, you cannot have good meditation. Even breathing can affect meditation. Here you are not sick, but because something is wrong with your breathing system, you cannot have a good meditation.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Sometimes I feel sleepy in meditation.</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Sometimes I feel sleepy in meditation." class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Suppose you find yourself feeling sleepy after thirty or forty minutes of most powerful meditation. At that time, I wish to say, the physical, vital and mental are not operating in you, but your inner being is operating most powerfully. Mentally you feel that you are not in this world and that you have to come back and be very dynamic. But no! At that time the soul is operating most powerfully.</p>
<p>Again, if you feel that you have been sleeping for half an hour, then naturally you are not meditating. If you are enjoying that kind of sleep, then try to repeat the name of the Supreme as fast as possible. It is not a race, but see how many times you can repeat "Supreme" with each breath. Then, when you feel the power inside the repetition of this name, your whole being will be inundated with divine energy and you are bound to feel a new flow of life and energy. If you repeat "Supreme" that way for five minutes, you will not fall asleep. Your utterance will enter into you as energy. Others may think that you are doing something abnormal, but you are doing the right thing. You may also shake your arms, and stretch your legs. But if you repeat "Supreme" in silence, then you are bound to become very dynamic.</p>

If we enter into activity do we become more awake?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is not good if there is too much activity. If you get up at five and if you touch a book, the consciousness of the book will enter into you. If you touch a novel, immediately the consciousness of the author will come. If you feel that you are drowsy and you start doing housework, then the housework consciousness will enter into you. When dealing with the physical, it is best to take a shower. When you take a shower you will not feel drowsy. Water signifies consciousness. Once consciousness enters into you, then how will you fall asleep?</p>
<p>But the other way is risky. If you touch a material object, then immediately the consciousness of that object will enter into you. If you stand against a wall and start cleaning the wall, the consciousness of the wall will enter into you. So the best thing to do is take a shower and then meditate.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Part VI — The height and depth of meditation</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part VI — The height and depth of meditation" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 <p></p>
<h2>Question: Is there a difference between height and depth in meditation?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> When we remain in the Universal Consciousness, when we remain inside the spiritual heart, we notice that the height and the depth are one. At that time there is no difference between height and depth. But when we come out of the Universal Consciousness, then we fail to see everything as one and inseparable. At that time our conscious awareness of two things looms large. It is like our head and our feet. Before we have established oneness with our head and our feet, we will say, "This is my head and these are my feet." But once we have established oneness in our entire being, we shall claim all our limbs as our very own. Then they become one reality. Like that, before we realise the highest, we use the terms height and depth. When we dive deep into the Pacific Ocean, like a diver, we are aiming at the depth. Then, when we are climbing the Himalayas, we are aiming at the height. But height and depth are all in the mental consciousness. Once we go beyond the barrier of the mind, there is only one reality. There the reality is spontaneous and universal. We don't call a drop by that name once it enters into the ocean. We call it the ocean itself. While the drop maintains its individuality, only then do we call it a drop and the rest of the water we call the ocean.</p>
<p>As long as we retain our individuality and personality, we will feel that height and depth are two separate things. When we are climbing up we will feel that we have reached a certain height, and when we are diving deep we will feel that we have reached a certain depth. But there comes a time when we go far, far beyond this meaningless comparison. At that time, only reality is singing and dancing within us and we become the reality itself. It has no height, no depth, no length. It is all one and, at the same time, it is transcending its own limits. We see limits according to our own standard, but Eternity, Infinity and Immortality are absolute realities. They don't have any limits. At the same time, they are more real than our eyes or our nose. I always say that God Himself is transcending His own Vision and Reality. For us it is unbelievable, unfathomable; but it is absolutely true.</p>
<p>We can notice this transcendence in our own individual life. We go to kindergarten; then we go to high school and college. We may get our Master's degree and Ph.D., but even then there is no end. If we say that we have learned everything, it will be a deplorable mistake. There is so much to learn, so much to learn. When we say that we have more to learn, we are more than prepared to transcend our knowledge and wisdom — what we have and what we are. This feeling or this consciousness we get only when we go beyond the domain of the mind. There we see philosophy and realisation as one. At that time there is no sense of separativity between height and depth. There is only one reality — omnipotent, transcendent and immortal.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If there is intensity, then it is not meditation; it is concentration. If there is tremendous intensity, then there is concentrated power. If you feel an intense force energising you like an express train, then it is the result of your concentration. But if you feel deep within an immense sea of peace, light and bliss, then that is your meditation. Meditation-power is all peace, poise and tranquility, like a sea, while concentration-power is like a bullet. Do not give any preference to either experience. Feel that if the Grace of the Supreme wants to concentrate in you and through you, then you will allow it. Again, if He wants meditation, you will allow Him to meditate in and through you.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is better to remain in ecstasy. Let ecstasy be a guiding voice while you are meditating. If you are feeling inner ecstasy, then let ecstasy direct you. Inside ecstasy there is an inner voice that is offering you the ecstasy. Let the inner voice guide you farther and give you more information to go higher.</p>

<h2>Question: Does it sometimes happen that when a person can't assimilate any more light, he just starts expressing it like a cup full to the brim that starts overflowing?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> If the cup is full to the brim, then naturally it will spill. Daily you are getting something from your prayer and meditation, and even while you are walking along the street, you are spreading this. But while spreading, you are not losing anything. It is like perfume that you keep right inside you. You are not actually using it. You are only keeping it, but it is offering its fragrance.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Can we consciously offer the fruit of our meditation?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Can we consciously offer the fruit of our meditation?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Certainly, if you want to. It is your money, your wealth, and you can give it consciously or unconsciously. Sri Ramakrishna said that God is like a child. A child may be standing with a piece of candy, and you are begging, "Give me the candy," but the child won't give it to you. It is his property, his wealth, and he won't give it. But somebody else who does not care for the candy or even for the child may be passing, and the child will run after him and say, "You take it." So here also, when you have inner wealth, it is up to you whether you give it or not. Somebody may come to you eager and anxious to have it, but you may not give it to that person because you do not like him. You will only give it to the person whom you like, although that person may not even care for it.</p>
<p>But again, you have to know that the individual you want to give it to is inwardly ready to receive it, even though he is outwardly not crying for it. God knows when an individual's inner being is totally ready, and He gives that particular individual His Wealth even though the person is not crying for it. But when the inner being of the person is not ready to receive God's Wealth, even though the individual is outwardly crying for it, he won't appreciate it or be able to receive it. He will just put a little into his mouth and not be satisfied. Then he will just throw it away; he will not utilise it properly.</p>

Does it mean to offer these qualities to others?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It can be to others, it can be to the atmosphere or it can be to the Universal Consciousness. Some people say, "Let me learn first. Then I will give." Others say, "No, let me give while learning." But from the spiritual point of view, when it is a matter of constant giving, it is always better to realise and assimilate first and then to give. Realise God, assimilate your realisation and then give to mankind. Otherwise, if you try to give before you realise God, all you have to give is partial light and partial truth. You may say, "Oh, I have got one dollar, let me give it." But you are spending your time giving that one dollar instead of getting the one hundred dollars, which is your goal. Then, you may be giving to an undeserving person, and he will just grab it. He will act like a dacoit, a thief, a robber. He will say, "No, you have more money. You are not giving me all your money." Then he will beat and strike you. In the inner world also, when one wants to give and he only has a dollar's worth of inner wealth, these forces will be tempted. They will feel that he has more wealth to give, which he is not giving. So they will strike the seeker and try to destroy his potentiality and possibility. Let us say you have only one dollar, and you want to give it to somebody who is very strong on the vital plane, very impure and obscure. This person may feel, "No, he is telling a lie; he has more money than one dollar," and he will try to grab you and get more money. But you won't be able to give him more than one dollar, so you will be destroyed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No. Within your activity if you can feel God's Presence, then whatever you are doing is with God and for God. Whether it is eating, or cooking, or working, if you are conscious of God, then you have to feel that God has entered into your activity. Sometimes you may be sitting quietly and trying to meditate, but you may be thinking of everything else in the world. So it is very possible that in the midst of activity you can feel the Presence of God more so than during your meditation.</p>
<p>Again, God comes to visit some people only when they are asleep. Before going to sleep they may meditate, but God will enter into their consciousness only when their mind and body are quiet, and this may happen only while they are sleeping.</p>

How can people find the time to be involved?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> How many hours do we have at our disposal? Twenty-four hours. Do we work for twenty-four hours? Do we sleep for twenty-four hours? Do we eat for twenty-four hours? No, we do quite a few things during these twenty-four hours. We can do all kinds of things during the day. We can mix with our friends, eat, go to school and do so many activities. What prevents us from thinking of God, poor God, for five minutes a day? We can't give five minutes to God during these twenty-four hours? We have time to do everything else. But when it is a matter of God, then we say that we don't have time. Just because we give more importance to something else, we don't find the time to give to poor God.</p>
<p>If we really care for God, God will give us time to think of Him. God is crying for us to think of Him. If we really want God, then we have plenty of time. But if we don't care for God, then we get time only to do other things.</p>
