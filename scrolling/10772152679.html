<p>If we take life very seriously, we do not always get the best out of life. Sometimes spontaneous joy is the only answer to keep life going.

<p>When Zatopek went back to the Olympic Village after winning his third gold medal in the Helsinki Games and later heard that his wife had won the gold medal in the javelin, his oneness was such that he said: "This gold one pleases me more than all the others so far." Such love and encouragement he gave to his wife!</p>

<p>It is not true that human life is nothing but a series of misfortunes, a chain of bondage and a night of destruction. Sometimes happiness-flood does inundate certain human beings. Such an experience lasts for the entire span of an individual's life and offers continuously a new significance to the pilgrims who have come to enjoy the earthly pilgrimage. Here Zatopek comments on the day in the Helsinki Olympics when he had won his third gold medal — for the marathon — and his wife, Dana, had taken a gold medal with a new Olympic record in the women's javelin: "It was a wonderful day. It was 24 July 1952. I remember it always. Indeed, it was all happiness for us."</p>

<p>The immortal runner was also a linguist. He was at home in German, French, English and Czechoslovakian. He felt that if he could speak to others in their own native tongues, then they would get more joy and enthusiasm. In the dressing room, Emil Zatopek would greet his opponents warmly. "Comment ca va? . . . Wie geht's? . .. How goes it?" Others sometimes did not greet him because of fear or nervousness. They did not want to lose their power of concentration. Zatopek was also nervous to some extent, but he had strength in his inner life, so he felt even if he had lost the race he would not feel miserable. He worked hard; that was his satisfaction. He had confidence in his ability; that was his satisfaction.</p>

<p>Only a seeker-runner can shed spiritual, divine light on the Olympics. Says Zatopek: "For me, the 1948 Olympics was a liberation of the spirit. After all those dark days of the war, the bombing, the killing, the starvation, the revival of the Olympics was as if the sun had come out. I went into the Olympic Village in 1948 and suddenly there were no more frontiers, no more barriers. Just the people meeting together. It was wonderfully warm. Men and women who had lost five years of life were back again."</p>

<p>The 1952 Helsinki Olympics and Zatopek will always remain inseparable and unique. The Olympics gave Zatopek the opportunity unparalleled. Zatopek gave the Olympics the glory unparalleled.</p>

<p>Instead of being consumed with pride, he was a radiant example of spontaneous concern and affection. On the eve of his last Olympic competition in 1956, Zatopek came to Calcutta with his wife Dana to run in a five-kilometre race. He was then 35 years old. The Indian champion, Gulzara Singh, lost to the Czechoslovakian badly. And what was his reaction? Singh touched Zatopek's shoes and sprinkled dust from the Czechoslovakian's feet onto his head. Perhaps only an Indian could offer such adoration to a fellow runner. The immortal Zatopek, a five-medal Olympian, also did something to capture the very breath of the Indian runner. He made him a present of his running shoes.</p>
<p>The seeker-runner in Zatopek is aware of the supreme truth that admiration and adoration are not a sign of inferiority but two divine qualities which eventually bring tremendous satisfaction to all walks of life.</p>

<p>Through the expansion of his heart, Zatopek always wanted to give and get joy. There is a most significant incident involving Ron Clarke. Ron Clarke was such a great runner. He set so many world records, but never got any gold medals. Zatopek's sympathetic heart felt the sadness of Clarke's heart. So in secret he gave Ron Clarke one of his gold medals, putting it in the younger runner's suitcase while he was visiting him. When Clarke got home and opened his suitcase, to his wide surprise he found Zatopek's gold medal.</p>
