  <h2 id="page-title">Part I: Silence</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Part I: Silence" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Life needs and wants victory, but the victory that we achieve in the world of sound does not last for long. This victory is very fleeting. The victory that we achieve in the world of silence is everlasting, and each time a victory dawns in this inner world we feel that we are being prepared for a higher and more fulfilling victory in tomorrow's Dawn.</p>
<p>An ordinary man thinks either that silence cannot be achieved or that it is of no avail. But a seeker knows that silence can be achieved on the strength of his inner cry. He also knows that silence is of tremendous importance, for without silence we cannot see the face of Truth or grow into the very image of Truth and Light. Silence is within but we have to discover it. Unless and until we discover our inner silence, we cannot feel that we are of God and for God. Inner silence is not just the absence of thoughts. No! Silence is the blossoming of our indomitable inner will. Silence is our inner wisdom-light. This wisdom-light is our conscious and constant surrender to the Will of our Inner Pilot, who inspires us, encourages us and guides us to the Shores of the Golden Beyond.</p>
<p>Silence is preparation, our preparation for God's examination. We come to know God's Hour only when we observe silence, only when we dive deep within. An unaspiring person does not and cannot know God's Hour. If God's Hour dawns in his life he fails to notice it. But a seeker who practises silence every day for half an hour or an hour knows when God's Hour is going to strike. And God not only tells him when the Hour will strike but also, like a private tutor, helps the seeker to pass his inner examination.</p>
<p>Silence is our protection. When we live in silence, we are protected by God's mightiest Power, His all-illumining Light. At that time the negative forces of fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, insecurity and selfishness can have no access to our inner being. We are protected by God within and without at every moment. Silence is our transformation. When we observe silence consciously, our outer being is transformed. This transformation is a great achievement for Mother Earth. When a human being is transformed, Mother Earth feels that she has achieved something momentous, something that can be kept for Eternity for the rest of humanity to treasure. And this transformation becomes a foundation for a higher and mightier achievement in the ever-continuing process of evolution.</p>
<p>Silence is our willpower. This willpower conquers the very pride of ignorance-night and manifests the Light of Divinity's Delight in aspiring souls who want to climb up to the highest pinnacle and bring down the message of Immortality to earth. Our human mind says, "Silence is emptiness; it is sheer emptiness and nothingness." But our aspiring heart knows that silence is the fulness and plenitude of our Eternity's Height and Infinity's Light.</p>

<p><em>Purnam adah purnam idam purnat</em><br /><em>purnam udacyate</em><br /><em>Purnasya purnam adaya purnam</em><br /><em>evavasisyate</em></p>


<p>Infinity is that.<br /> Infinity is this.<br /> From Infinity, Infinity has come into existence.<br /> From Infinity, when Infinity is taken away, Infinity remains.</p>

<p>This is the message that we get from silence. Again, the soul tells us that silence is oneness, our inseparable oneness, our universal oneness with the Pilot Supreme.</p>
<p>Silence is our Truth-consciousness, our highest Reality. This Reality in the inner world is our divine Love, our supreme Love for the world at large. And this Reality in the outer world is the supreme Glory of the Supreme for aspiring humanity.</p>
<p>Here we are all seekers. At times we are prone to watch our weaknesses, incapacities, limitations and imperfections. When we do this we are bound to be disappointed with ourselves. But our inner silence illumines us. It says, "Don't be disappointed. It is God within you who is going through a series of experiences in and through your imperfections." When we realise God, we see that these imperfections were necessary at the time for our evolution. And then, when they were no longer necessary, these imperfections were turned into perfections. From darkness we enter into Light. From the unreal we enter into Reality. From death we enter into Immortality.</p>

<p><em>Asato ma sad gamaya</em><br /><em>Tamaso ma jyotir gamaya</em><br /><em>Mrityor ma amritam gamaya</em></p>


<p>Lead me from the unreal to the Real.<br /> Lead me from darkness to Light.<br /> Lead me from death to Immortality.</p>

<p>Silence tells the seeker in us to love, to love himself. It tells us it is wrong to hate ourselves because of our imperfections. When the seeker loves himself, loves the Divine within himself, he eventually realises the Ultimate Truth. Then he comes to realise that it was not he who loved the Divine in himself, but it was God the Lover who loved God the eternal Beloved Supreme within him.</p>
<p>In Heaven God is Silence-dream. On earth God is Reality-Sound. In His Silence, God prepares Himself. Through His cosmic Sound, God manifests Himself. The transcendental Silence is our Source, and the emanating sound is our manifestation. The higher we go, the deeper the silence we enjoy. And the deeper the silence we enjoy, the more fulfilling the manifestation of our divinity.</p>

 <p></p>
<h2>Question: What is the sound that we sometimes hear in a river?</h2>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is the sound of movement and forward progress. It is progressing towards its destination. Movement can occur at one spot. Somebody can be singing and dancing in the same spot. A runner can be jogging in the same spot, lifting his legs. But he can also run forward.</p>
<p>Similarly, a river is the movement of consciousness. A river has water and water signifies consciousness. When the river flows it is the forward movement of consciousness. The sound of a river that we hear is the sound that embodies the forward movement of consciousness.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The spiritual aspirant can attain and maintain silence only by diving deep within. He has to feel that every moment is a golden opportunity to transcend himself. He has to feel God as his very own. If he can do this, then without fail he will get silence and he will be able to maintain silence.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: Why did God create sound?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: Why did God create sound?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God created sound in order to know outwardly what He is inwardly. Inwardly He knows what He is, but if He does not outwardly manifest His inner Divinity then the world cannot accept Him, cannot realise Him. So He created sound just for the sake of manifestation, His own manifestation.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> It is always advisable to become both the best of silence and the best of sound all at once. We have to know what is meant by "the best of silence" and "the best of sound." The best of silence means our highest Height, the ever-transcending Height. The best of sound means God-manifestation in and through us, constantly, consciously and unconditionally.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are two types of music: earthly music and Heavenly music. There is also a third type which is the Music of the Supreme. Earthly music stimulates the vital in us, Heavenly music illumines us and spreads the divinity within us and the Music of the Supreme fulfils the Reality within us.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: What is the most meaningful sound for spiritual awakening?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: What is the most meaningful sound for spiritual awakening?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The most meaningful sound is <em>AUM</em>, which is the mother of all Indian <em>mantras</em>. <em>Mantra</em> means incantation. But if we say that <em>AUM</em> is an Indian mantra, it will be an act of injustice to God's most sublime and unparalleled Message to humanity. God's Message in the form of <em>AUM</em> will always remain unparalleled. <em>AUM</em> is the combination of three letters, A-U-M, which represent the three principal figures in the heart of the Supreme: Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Transformer. The moment we start chanting or pronouncing <em>AUM</em>, 'A' is purifying the physical in us. When we pronounce 'A' soulfully, it purifies the ignorance of millennia within us. When we chant 'U' most soulfully we have to feel that all our vital emotions from time immemorial are illumined. And when we chant 'M' most soulfully, we have to feel that our limited, sophisticated, earthbound mind is totally freed from the meshes of ignorance. So if you can pronounce, if you can chant most soulfully A-U-M, then the body consciousness is purified, the vital consciousness is illumined and the mental consciousness is perfected. When this is done, we become undoubtedly the supreme instruments of the Absolute Supreme.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> The experience of sound must come from the heart. It is inside the heart, inside the soul. From the heart the sound, like a river, can flow right up to the head. It can flow up. I can flow down. But the experience must originate in the inner heart, spiritual heart. This is the place where the soul is located. It is actually the light of the soul coming to the fore that we hear in the form of sound.</p>

How can I be really silent?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are some people who have disturbing sounds within them, but outwardly they pretend to be very silent. If they have real divine silence in the depth of their heart, then outwardly they will also have silence. But if the inside is false, then the outside will also be false. Outside we see the reflection of what we have within. So if we want to be really silent, then first we have to be silent within, inside our heart. Then automatically there will come a time when the mind and vital will also be silent and freed from the disturbing sounds.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> While playing a musical instrument, you have to feel that music is the universal language, that music has and also is the key to unlock the Heart-Door of the Supreme. It is only music that has a free access to unlock the Heart-Door of the universal Heart of the Supreme. If you can do that, then the musician in you will be able to manifest the Highest.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Silence is at once the Language of God and also the best medium through which the Supreme communicates not only to our soul, but also to our outer being. Our soul understands the message, the language of silence, but our outer being does not understand it. Once our outer being is purified and our outer life is considerably disciplined, then like the soul, we will be able to understand the Silence-Language of God when He offers us any message.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sound and silence can help us to grow spiritually provided we know what to expect from silence and from sound. From silence we have to expect the potential of a seed. And from sound we have to expect the capacity of a tree. If there is no seed there can be no tree. Again, if there is no tree there can be no seed. Here the seed is silence. Now if the seed remains only under the ground, then what good does it to? It has to germinate, it has to become a plant and then a huge tree with flowers and fruits and so forth. Then only is the tree helping mankind, serving the Supreme in mankind. If a seeker knows that silence is the seed and sound is the tree, then he will be able to grow spiritually.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">Question: How is it that sound in the form of music can so immediately awaken and inspire our hearts?</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Question: How is it that sound in the form of music can so immediately awaken and inspire our hearts?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Sound in the form of music immediately awakens and inspires our hearts because music embodies the Absolute Lord Supreme. The Lord Supreme also is cherishing His most treasured Wealth, which is music. His Music is universal Harmony, universal Peace, universal Love.</p>
<p>Music is the universal Body of the Supreme. If music is taken away from God, then God's Body is taken. Now if the body is gone, the soul is useless. Similarly, the body without the soul is of no help. The body we need for manifestation and the soul we need for realisation. It is like the instrument and the musician. Without the instrument how can anything be played? The musician will remain alone as an individual, unmanifested. And if there is no musician, who will play on the instrument? Both are supremely necessary.</p>
