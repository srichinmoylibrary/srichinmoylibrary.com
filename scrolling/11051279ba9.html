<p><em>(Rama's palace. Rama has invited all his ministers and priests to discuss a serious matter. Everyone has arrived except his preceptor, Vashishtha. Vashishtha has a special seat of his own. Suddenly a man of very low caste enters and deliberately sits on Vashishtha's seat.)</em></p>
<p>EVERYONE NEARBY: Get up! Get up!</p>
<p>A MINISTER: How dare you sit on this seat? This is Vashishtha's seat. He is the preceptor, the Guru of King Rama.</p>
<p><em>(Enter Vashishtha.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISHTHA: Why is this man sitting on my seat? <em>(To the man.)</em> How dare you sit there? I shall kill you! Rama, if you are a true disciple of mine, you must kill this rascal.</p>
<p><em>(Rama gets his bow and arrow. The man runs for his life.)</em></p>
<p>VASHISHTHA: Rama, you have to kill this rogue, this infidel! I can give you only three chances at most. If you fail in your first attempt, you can try two more times. And if you fail in your third attempt to kill him, I will think you are a useless archer.</p>
<p>RAMA: You know I have killed Ravana, the King or the Demons. Is there anyone I cannot kill on the first attempt, O Vashishtha, O peerless Sage? I assure you, either I shall kill that fellow where I find him, or I shall bring him here.</p>
<p>VASHISHTHA: No, Rama, I don't want you to bring him here. Just kill him wherever you find him. God knows where he is by now.</p>
<p>RAMA: With your blessing let me leave.</p>
<p><em>(Vashishtha blesses Rama.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Rama is looking for the man. Finally he sees him at a distance. He gives chase, and the man runs for his life )</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Ah, I see he is entering into my Hanuman's house. The rogue is caught! He does not know that the house belongs to Hanuman, my dearest devotee. <em>(Shouts)</em> Hanuman! Hanuman!</p>
<p><em>(Enter Hanuman's mother)</em></p>
<p>HANUMAN'S MOTHER: O Rama, you have come. I am so grateful to you. Your presence has sanctified my home. O Rama, please wait for a few minutes. Hanuman will be coming immediately, He is getting ready to see you.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Hanuman's mother)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Hanuman with folded hands.)</em></p>
<p>HANUMAN: Please tell me what I can do for you, my Lord.</p>
<p>RAMA: Hanuman, where has he gone? Where is that rascal? Bring him out! He has insulted my Guru, Vashishtha. He sat on Vashishtha's seat. Vashishtha wants me to kill him. I have to fulfil Vashishtha's desire. Bring him out and I shall kill him.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: O Rama, I am sorry but I cannot bring him out.</p>
<p>RAMA: I can't believe my ears! Is this you, Hanuman, my dearest disciple? I was under the impression that you were ready to give your life for me at any moment.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: That is true. I will give my life for you. But this is not my life. It is somebody else's life.</p>
<p>RAMA: That means you won't listen to me, to my request, my demand, my command?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I am sorry. Forgive me. My mother has given him shelter. <em>Janani janmabhumih cha swargacapi gariyasi.</em> "Mother and Mother Earth are superior to Heaven itself."</p>
<p>RAMA: But I am your Lord. Am I not superior to everything in your life?</p>
<p>HANUMAN: That is true, but how am I going to break my mother's promise?</p>
<p>RAMA: If you want to fulfil your mother's promise, then you are no longer my dearest disciple. I must come first in your life, Hanuman.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Yes, you do come first in my life. I have to break my mother's promise. I am prepared. To please you is to please God, Rama, how are you going to kill this man?</p>
<p>RAMA: I am going to kill him with my arrows. Vashishtha has allowed me three attempts. He made me promise to try three times and then give up. But it will be a real disgrace if I cannot kill a human being in three attempts.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: Please wait here. I shall bring the culprit right to you.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Hanuman)</em></p>
<p>RAMA <em>(to himself):</em> I knew. The moment I saw the culprit entering into Hanuman's house, I knew it was his end. He could not escape me. The human emotions created some problem for my Hanuman; that is why he took his mother's side. But the divine in him is so strong, so powerful, that it has to come forward, and it did come forward. That is why he is bringing the culprit to me.</p>
<p><em>(Hanuman brings the culprit before Rama.)</em></p>
<p>HANUMAN: He is ready, Rama. You can satisfy yourself now.</p>
<p><em>(Rama aims at the culprit and shoots. The arrow drops without piercing his heart. Rama is wonder-struck.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: What? How can this be? I killed Ravana, the most powerful demon on earth, and now my arrow fails. Let me try a second time. <em>(The same thing happens the second time.)</em> Only one more chance is left! Let me make my third attempt. <em>(The same thing happens the third time.)</em></p>
<p>HANUMAN: Lord, you have to keep your promise now. You have three times tried to kill him, and three times you have failed. Now you can't try anymore.</p>
<p>RAMA: No, I can't. I won't. But Hanuman, tell me: how could all this happen? I am the King of Kings, and my arrow fails today so miserably for the first time.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: I shall tell you the secret. I told the man to begin repeating in silence, the moment you drew back your bow, "Victory to Lord Rama." And the second time you drew it back, I asked him to repeat, "Victory to the consort of Sita." The third time, "Victory to Dasharatha's eldest son." So each time he prayed for your victory. Now if someone sincerely prays for your own victory, how can you kill that person? Your soul's divinity was pleased with him because he was praying for your victory. It was your vital and your mind that wanted to kill him. Naturally your soul's will shall always conquer the will of your vital and mind. You are the Lord of the gods. He prayed to you for your victory. Naturally your soul gave him protection, even though your mind and vital were begging for his destruction. The power of your soul is infinitely greater than the power of your vital desire.</p>
<p>RAMA: My dearest disciple, I accept my defeat with deepest joy and blessingful pride. I accept my defeat by you, my dearest devotee. You have taught me a lesson. My soul's will shall always conquer my vital and mental craving. I have failed in my outer attempt. But my body's failure is my soul's success. The success of my soul over my body is infinitely more meaningful and fruitful than my outer success.</p>
<p>HANUMAN: This knowledge that I have offered to you was granted to me by you. Is there anything I have that has not come from you? My knowledge, my power, everything that I have, everything that I am, has all come from you. In order to glorify me, in order to immortalise me, you are acting like my student. But I know that I am your eternal student. I know you are my eternal teacher.</p>
<p><em>(Hanuman sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Janar age tomai ami henechhi</em><br /><em>Pabar age tomai ami jenechhi.</em><br /><em>Debar age tomai ami peyechhi.</em><br /><em>Taito tomai mor amire sanpechhi.</em></p>

<p>Before I knew You, I struck You.<br /> Before I received You, I knew You.<br /> Before I gave myself to You, I received You.<br /> Therefore to You I have offered,<br /> sacrificed and surrendered<br /> my ego-reality's existence.</p>

<p><em>(Rama and Lakshmana in a room.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: Lakshmana, my dearest brother, you are my joy, you are my pride. The world admires me, adores me, but I know why I have become great, how I have become great and who has made me great. It is all because of you, my Lakshmana.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: O Rama, you are my eldest brother, but I have always considered you to be my father. To be with you, to be of service to you, is to live with the highest Goal.</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Amar bhuban tomar charan lagi</em><br /><em>Amar jiban tomar swapan lagi</em><br /><em>Ogo asimer nirabata</em><br /><em>Ogo dyuloker amarata</em><br /><em>Eso eso eso e hiya rayechhe jagi</em></p>

<p>My world is for Your Feet.<br /> My life is for Your Dream.<br /> O silence of infinity,<br /> O immortality of Heaven,<br /> Come, come, come.<br /> This heart remains awake.</p>

<p><em>(Enter Yamaraj in the guise of a holy man.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Rama, I would like to have a private interview with you. I have to discuss something most important with you, something most urgent, and during our conversation I do not want anyone else to be present, only you and me.</p>
<p>RAMA: That can easily be done. I shall certainly do it, venerable Sir.</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana is about to leave.)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Please wait. <em>(Lakshmana waits.)</em> O Rama, give me your promise that whoever enters, whoever comes here during our conversation, will be put to death.</p>
<p>RAMA: Yes, I devotedly agree to your proposal. Lakshmana, my dearest brother, do not allow anybody to enter into this room. Keep a rigid watch, and no matter who it is, do not allow anyone to intrude on our private talk.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA <em>(with folded hands):</em> Rama, I am at your supreme command.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Lakshmana)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Rama, I am Yamaraj, the King of Death. I have been sent to you by Brahma, the Eternal Creator. He has asked me to tell you that your play on earth is done. You have fought very hard to establish the Kingdom of <em>Dharma</em> on earth, and you have succeeded. Now your time is up. You are needed in Heaven.</p>
<p>RAMA: I am happy to hear that my time has at last come. My Sita is no longer with me. Just to please the world I tortured her heart. I cared more for the world than for my dearest wife. Now she has left her body, cast off her mortal sheath, just to please me. I was such a rascal, such a wretched fellow. Now I shall meet her in the other world. I am so happy to go with you.</p>
<p><em>(Enter hurriedly Lakshmana.)</em></p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Rama, Rama, my brother, the Sage Durvasha has come and he wants to see you immediately. I told him you were occupied and not available. He got furious and told me that in the twinkling of an eye he would destroy your whole family and your whole Kingdom. I don't want him to destroy our family or our beloved Kingdom of Ayodhya. I know that nobody is allowed to come in here during your conversation, but I felt that I must sacrifice my life. It is better to die at the hands of my dearest brother Rama than to die at the hands of Durvasha.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: Rama, we have not finished our conversation, and your brother has entered. That means he must die.</p>
<p>RAMA: It is true. It is true. Lakshmana, go and bring Durvasha here. In the meantime we will finish our conversation.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Lakshmana)</em></p>
<p>YAMARAJ: So, are you ready? Soon you will be called away. Are you ready?</p>
<p>RAMA: Yes, I am fully prepared.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: And what about your brother? He has violated your injunction.</p>
<p>RAMA: Yes.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: And he will be put to death?</p>
<p>RAMA: He will.</p>
<p>YAMARAJ: I know you will keep your promise. May God bless you!</p>
<p><em>(Exit Yamaraj)</em></p>
<p><em>(Enter Lakshmana and Durvasha.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA <em>(folding his hands):</em> O Sage, O Sage of the highest magnitude, forgive me, forgive me. I was having a most important private conversation with a guest, and that is why I could not see you immediately. Please forgive me. Now, please tell me how I can serve you. I am at your service.</p>
<p>DURVASHA: Rama, I am extremely hungry. I have not eaten for a long, long time. But today I want to eat your food. I don't want to eat anything else — only the food that is prepared for you.</p>
<p>RAMA: I am so proud that a great sage like you, Durvasha, wants to eat my food. Lakshmana, go and bring my food.</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana goes and comes back with food. Durvasha eats with great satisfaction. When he is finished, he turns to Rama.)</em></p>
<p>DURVASHA: Rama, I bless you with all my heart and soul. You have satisfied my outer hunger, and I shall fulfil your inner hunger. Very soon you will be with your beloved Sita in the other world.</p>

<p><em>(Rama, Lakshmana and the ministers and elders.)</em></p>
<p>RAMA: What am I going to do? I have to keep my promise. Lakshmana is dearer than my life, but a promise is a promise.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA: Rama, do not feel sorry. Do not weep. You have to keep your promise. You must kill me according to your promise. I will be happy to be killed by you. There can be no greater joy than to be punished by you. There can be no better death than to be killed by you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: O Rama, since it was your promise that you would put to death any intruder, I wish you to banish your brother from the Kingdom. This punishment is equivalent to killing him.</p>
<p>RAMA: For me to live without my brother Lakshmana is also my death. To be away from him, not to see him around me, is my worst death.</p>
<p>LAKSHMANA <em>(bowing):</em> Brother, Father, you are my All. I want the world to see that you are the Incarnation of Truth. You have established the Kingdom of <em>Dharma.</em> Your promise and your life can never be separated. They are one and inseparable. I am now leaving the palace. I will go and meditate on the bank of the Sarayu, and when the time comes I shall jump into the river and give up my life.</p>
<p>RAMA: O joy of my heart, O love of my heart, O power of my heart, you are leaving me. You are embracing death. Because of your constant sacrifice, this world knows me. And in the other world, I will also be known because of your sacrifice. I will be adored and worshipped. O brother of my heart and soul, O brother of eternity, you have followed me everywhere; wherever I have gone you have followed me like my own shadow. When Father sent me into exile, when I had to bring Sita back from Ravana, you followed me. But now, O Lakshmana, I shall follow you. I shall follow your life-breath. You go and reserve my place in the other world, in the world of the Beyond. I am coming.</p>
<p><em>(Lakshmana bows to his brother and begins to leave)</em></p>
<p><em>(Rama sings.)</em></p>
<p><em>Deshe deshe cha bandhabah</em><br /><em>Tantu desha na pashyami</em><br /><em>Yatra bratha sahodara.</em></p>
<p>RAMA: In all countries there are wives, in all countries there are friends, but I shall not find a brother like Lakshmana anywhere in this world.</p>
