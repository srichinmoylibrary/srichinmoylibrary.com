<h2>The inner world and the outer world</h2>

<p>The inner world prepares me. The outer world utilises me.</p>
<p>The inner world feeds me. The outer world announces me.</p>
<p>In the inner world I am all aspiration. In the outer world I am all revelation. What is aspiration? Aspiration is a soulful cry of my eternal life. What is revelation? Revelation is a fruitful smile of my immortal soul.</p>
<p>In the inner world I know that I eternally am. In the outer world I know that I constantly can. I am eternally God's instrument. This is what I know in the inner world. I can serve God, please God and fulfil God in His own Way. This is what I know in the outer world.</p>
<p>In the inner world I try to see God's Height, His transcendental Height. In the outer world I try to see God's Length, His boundless Length.</p>
<p>In the inner world I try to enter into God's Golden Boat. Out of His infinite Bounty He allows me to be in His Boat. In the outer world God carries me and pilots me to His Reality Shore, at His choice Hour. This also He does out of His infinite Bounty.</p>
<p>There comes a time when my inner world and my outer world become inseparably one. At that time I feel that my reality and God's Reality are inseparably one, that my reality's height and God's Reality's Height are inseparably one, that my vision-world and God's Vision-World are inseparably one. At that time I as a seeker become one with my Master, I as a dreamer become one with my reality, I as a divine lover become one with my Supreme Beloved.</p>
<p>In my inner world I need to love my outer world more, in a divine way. In my outer world I need to listen to my inner world more, in a soulful way. If I do not feel the need for my inner world, my aspiration-world, then I shall not be able to understand my outer world. My outer world's determination, manifestation, perfection and satisfaction entirely depend on my inner world's peace, harmony and oneness.</p>

<p><em>(Sri Chinmoy plays the esraj.)</em></p>
<p><em>Donna Halper:</em> Wow! How would you like to do that for the whole rest of the show? God is that beautiful! We have a whole group of engineers who are saying that's nice, seriously. For our audience the instrument which he is playing is called the esraj. I'd like to ask you now what is the purpose of this music when you are meditating? What is the effect it is supposed to have on a person while he is meditating?</p>
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Soulful music intensifies our meditation. Soulful music expedites our soul's journey. Soulful music helps the seeker establish his conscious and inseparable oneness with the Supreme Pilot. Therefore I give great importance to music in the spiritual life.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> We cannot define God in terms of one specific feeling or experience. Each one has to experience God for himself. If we say God is all Peace or God is all Delight then there will be people to contradict us. Each one has to define God for himself. We all want he have satisfaction. I have satisfaction by experiencing truth and light and others will also derive satisfaction from that reality-experience although they may call it by a different name.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> They do come to me for that but only people who believe in God come to me. Stark atheists do not come to me. For them God is something else. The God we speak of is not God for them. But again I have deepest respect for their God. If they say that there is no such thing as God I say all right.

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> There are quite a few ways to know whether a Master is genuine or not. If the Master says that he will be able to grant you realisation overnight, then he is a false Master. If he says that if you give him a fee of a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, then he will be able to help you enter into a higher realm of consciousness and attain Peace, Light and Bliss, then he is a false Master. A true Master will tell the seeker all the time that he is not God; he is not even the Guru. God Himself is the real Master. The human Master is only serving God in the seekers; he is not the Guru. The real Guru is God Himself. So if a seeker wants to know who a true Master is, from these guidelines he can usually know the real from the false.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> No, I do not advocate austerity. I do not want my disciples to live in the Himalayan caves. We advocate acceptance of life. We have to accept life and then we have to transform life. There are many things in human life which we cannot appreciate. These are our deplorable weaknesses. So we try to illumine these weaknesses. We do not shun life. We accept life, but we transform the things that have to be transformed.</p>

<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> Yes, they do chant occasionally. I have composed quite a few melodies for verses from the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. I have set tune to quite a few verses, and my students occasionally chant them.</p>
