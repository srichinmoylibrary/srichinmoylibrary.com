  <h2 id="page-title">Going to Russia</h2><span property="dc:title" content="Going to Russia" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>At around ten o'clock at night I ordered food: coffee, french fries, chilled soup and plain salad. A black girl said, "Please tell me what kind of dressing you want."</p>
<p>I said, "I don't know. Any dressing."</p>
<p>Then she asked me, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>I said, "Fifty."</p>
<p>Then she said to me, "Grandpa, I am sending you Russian dressing. I will send you to Russia."</p>
<p>I said, "How I wish I could go to Russia!" This was our joke.</p>
<p>When I ordered, they told me that in half an hour they would send the food to my room. After an hour had passed I phoned and said, "Please cancel my order; it is getting late." But they said they had just sent it. Finally the food came, but unfortunately it was not good.</p>
<p>When they gave me the bill I just signed it without looking at it. In the morning I saw that it had come to $17.50! Why? There was a service charge.</p>

<p>The next morning I went out to run at five o'clock. I was running right in front of the hotel. Seventy or eighty metres I ran. Then I stopped, and then again I ran. I did this seven times. The weather in Bermuda was like Chicago: very windy! At times you couldn't even walk, so how was I going to run?</p>
<p>There were about seven or eight taxis in front of the hotel. One taxi driver, an old man, was joking with me. He came very near me and was watching me. Then he said to me, "Champ, you have two long legs. Champ, you have long legs, long legs!" I was wearing shorts, although it was quite chilly. He was a gentleman, so he was wearing trousers.</p>
<p>It was so dangerous there. There was no proper sidewalk. I saw so many scooters. How fast they went! It reminded me of our vacation in Bermuda a few years ago.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The Waterloo hotel</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The Waterloo hotel" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>Later that morning I walked across the street to the Rosenden Hotel, because I didn't like the Princess. The Rosenden was a very, very nice place, and the man there was also very, very nice. I said, "All right, I shall take a room here." I told him that I would be back in an hour. I sincerely meant it!</p>
<p>Then while walking I passed the Waterloo Hotel, and I remembered that the previous time I had stayed at the Waterloo. I went inside and the old lady at the desk jumped up. Immediately she recognised me. She said, "I remember you! Your room near the water is unfortunately occupied." In that room I wrote fifty songs. "I shall show you another room. The regular price is $135, but now it is off-season so the price has come down to $90. Last time you didn't eat breakfast. If you don't eat breakfast, the price becomes $70, so the total with tax will be $80.50. Are you ready to take it?"</p>
<p>I said to myself, "How does she still remember that four years ago I didn't have breakfast?" I was very, very happy about the idea of going back to the Waterloo. It was only two blocks from the Princess. I said to myself, "Definitely I will take the Waterloo. Waterloo is so famous because of Napoleon!"</p>
<p>But, O God! The wind was so strong! While I was walking back to the Princess, it pushed me so hard-as if I were a cotton ball! It felt like I was running at a six minute pace instead of just walking. When I reached the Princess Hotel, I couldn't move because the wind seemed to be all inside my back-it was so stiff! What could I do? The Princess Hotel was bad, and the other two places were so good. Still, instead of changing hotels, my decision was to come back home to Queens.</p>

<p>I went to the airport, but I had a two-hour wait, so I went to Georgetown. There I was watching the water and wondering how I was going to kill time. Right in front of me there were twenty elderly women in a park. All of a sudden, some kind of music came from a house and they all started dancing!</p>
<p>Then I went to a restaurant and waited, waited, waited. Instead of being at the airport, at least I was near some hotels.</p>

  <h2 id="page-title">The flat tyre</h2><span property="dc:title" content="The flat tyre" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p>To go back to the airport I took a taxi. The taxi fare in Bermuda starts with eighty cents. I never look at the meter, but this time, after we had covered fifty metres, I happened to look at it. O God! It said $3.10. I said to the driver, "I just entered into the cab. How can it be $3.10 already?"</p>
<p>He said, "Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry." Then he changed the meter back to eighty cents. We covered another two hundred metros and boom! We had a flat tire.</p>
<p>The driver, an old man, said, "You are a bad man; that is why we got a flat tire.</p>
<p>I said, "Either I am bad or you are bad or both of us are bad. What am I going to do?"</p>
<p>He asked me to give him a hand. What could I do? I could only get out of the taxi. I got out, but it took him such a long time. He was an old man, and he could barely get out of the car, but I could not give him any help. I just looked at him sympathetically.</p>
<p>I saw two or three taxis going from Georgetown towards the airport, but they would not stop. Nobody was sympathetic. After some time I raised my hand and one particular man stopped. As soon as he saw us he started singing, "Flat tire!" He was amused.</p>
<p>I said, "Just take me to the airport for whatever you want to charge."</p>
<p>He said, "Three dollars."</p>
<p>I gave him three dollars, and he said, "It will take only five minutes. I also am going there."</p>

<p>When I arrived back at the airport, the lady at the counter looked at my ticket. She saw that I was supposed to stay there for three days but I was leaving after one day. She said to me, "Why are you not staying here?"</p>
<p>I said, "I don't like this place at all." There was no sun, and it was dark and cloudy.</p>
<p>She said, "I don't blame you."</p>

<p>I didn't have to pay the telephone bill, but I did have to pay a penalty to the airline. The price of my ticket had been fifty dollars less because I was on a three-day excursion. When I changed my ticket, I had to pay fifty dollars extra. So twenty-seven dollars I saved, but fifty dollars I lost. Still, I was happy to come home because here at any time I can get heat-at least from the radiator.</p>
<p>In Bermuda it rains only twenty days a year, but one of those days was when I was there!</p>

<p>Another time I went to Bermuda for three days alone. The hotel was beautiful. It was near the water. But that time also it was raining heavily the whole time and I could not even go out. I only went across the street once to a Chinese restaurant. During those three days I wrote two hundred poems; that was my only consolation.</p>
