<p><em>(Early 1927. A Parsi youth of twenty-two, seeking out ochre-robed sadhus in various corners of Bombay. His studies, his own literary talents, his ultra-modern frame of mind, the ease and comfort of his home-life, all that is beautiful in the visible and the known have lost their charm for him. A sudden touch from somewhere has cut him off from his moorings. He is drifting about in a quest of the Unknown. Some method of meditation he has gathered and tried. Yet his thirst grows on unappeased.</em></p>
<p><em>Now he comes across a Theosophist and questions him.)</em></p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: <em>(After a little talk)</em> Excuse me, young man, you are a complex problem.</p>
<p>THE YOUTH: How?</p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: There is a passion for poetry in you and there is also an urge towards philosophy.</p>
<p>THE YOUTH: But now I am swayed by neither. The one thing that is master in me at present is a pull towards the Unknown.</p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: True. But the other things have only got pushed into the background. They are biding their time.</p>
<p>THE YOUTH: I don't think so.</p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: Human nature is not so simple. All the elements in you will come up at their proper moment.</p>
<p>THE YOUTH: What am I to do, then?</p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: Nobody can take you up in all your complexity, except one Master.</p>
<p>THE YOUTH: <em>(Eagerly)</em> Who, please?</p>
<p>THE THEOSOPHIST: Aurobindo Ghose of Pondicherry. He has the Cosmic Consciousness.</p>
<p><em>(The very mention of the name acts like another mysterious touch, a saving, answering touch. The Parsi youth stands still a few fateful moments. The Theosophist scans his face.</em></p>
<p><em>Sometime later, the youth goes to Bombay's Crawford Market for a new pair of shoes. Back home, as he unwraps the shoe-box, right before his eyes falls that part of the newspaper sheet which bears in bold type the headline "The Ashram of Aurobindo Ghose". The third touch? Assuredly the youth takes it as a "sun-burst".</em></p>
<p><em>He devours the long article written by a visitor and finds in it the needed fact: the prospect of a new existence, not rejecting but transforming common life and its concerns. Also, for the first time he comes across those words. "The Mother.")</em></p>
<p>K.D. SETHNA: <em>(Speaking to himself)</em> Here's the end of my search. I must write to the Ashram authorities. But will they accept me?</p>

<p><em>(Chittagong. Two disciples of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.)</em></p>
<p>A: I have time and again told you that the Mother and Sri Aurobindo are one.</p>
<p>B: But have you ever felt it?</p>
<p>A: I have no need to feel it. I know they are one.</p>
<p>B: But how?</p>
<p>A: How? Sri Aurobindo has clearly said that his Consciousness and the Mother's are one and the same.</p>
<p>B: You think I have no faith in Sri Aurobindo?</p>
<p>A: If you have, then why such hesitation?</p>
<p>B: Not actually hesitation, but ...</p>
<p>A: You must not call yourself a disciple of Sri Aurobindo if you fail to believe in him. Apart from it, it is you who will be the loser, if you are wanting in faith in him. I can tell you something quite striking. Just yesterday when my mother had a heart attack I called upon Sri Aurobindo to protect her. Whom I actually saw, you know, was the Mother by the side of my mother. And to the surprise of the doctor and others my mother has come round. And to-day when I concentrated on the Mother out of the fulness of my grateful heart I saw Sri Aurobindo before me with his benign smile.</p>
<p>B: <em>(Clasping A)</em> True! I fully believe you. Now tell me a little more about their oneness of being and action.</p>
<p>A: Sri Aurobindo says: "The Mother's consciousness and mine are the same, the one Divine Consciousness in two, because that is necessary for the play. Nothing can be done without her knowledge and force, without her consciousness — if anybody really feels her consciousness, he should know that I am there behind it and if he feels me it is the same with hers."</p>

<p><em>(Ashram. Sri Aurobindo alone in his room, surveying within himself his ideal and his mission.)</em></p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: "It is not for personal greatness that I am seeking to bring down the Supermind. I care nothing for greatness or littleness in the human sense. I am seeking to bring some principle of inner Truth, Light, Harmony, Peace into the earth-consciousness. I see it above and know what it is — I feel it ever gleaming down on my consciousness from above and I am seeking to make it possible for it to take up the whole being into its own native power, instead of the nature of man continuing to remain in half-light, half-darkness. I believe the descent of this Truth opening the way to a development of divine consciousness here to be the final sense of the earth evolution. If greater men than myself have not had this vision and this ideal before them that is no reason why I should not follow my Truth-sense and Truth-vision. If human reason regards me as a fool for trying to do what Krishna did not try, I do not in the least care. There is no question of X or Y or anybody else in that. It is a question between the Divine and myself — whether it is the Divine Will or not, whether I am sent to bring that down or open the way for its descent or at least make it more possible or not. Let all men jeer at me if they will or all Hell fall upon me if it will for my presumption, — I go on till I conquer or perish. This is the spirit in which I seek the Supermind, no hunting for greatness for myself or others.</p>
<p>"I have no intention of achieving the Supermind for myself only — I am not doing anything for myself, as I have no personal need of anything, neither of salvation <em>(moksa)</em> nor supramentalisation. If I am seeking after supramentalisation, it is because it is a thing that has to be done for the earth-consciousness and if it is not done in myself, it cannot be done in others. My supramentalisation is only a key for opening the gates of the Supramental to the earth-consciousness; done for its own sake, it would be perfectly futile."</p>

<p><em>(Ashram. A visiting sadhak und Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>SADHAK: It seems both you and the Mother are working hard for a new humanity to begin on earth. But will the Orient only rise to the occasion? To be more precise, those alone who belong to this land of ours, where the Indian race has done Yoga for millenniums, seem capable of realising your Supermind. What about other peoples?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: "We are not working for a race or a people or a continent or for a realisation of which only Indians or only Orientals are capable. Our aim is not, either to found a religion or a school or philosophy or a school of Yoga, but to create a ground and a way of spiritual growth and experience and a way which will bring down a great Truth beyond the mind but not inaccessible to the human soul and consciousness. All can pass who are drawn to that Truth, whether they are from India or elsewhere, from the East or from the West."</p>

<p>INMATE: Mother, we know that you are always with us. But in what sense? Please throw some light on this query of ours.</p>
<p>MOTHER: "I am with you, that signifies a world of things, because I am with you on all levels, in all planes, from the supreme Consciousness down to the most physical; here, at Pondicherry, you cannot breathe without breathing my consciousness ... There is a special personal tie between you and me, between all who have turned to Sri Aurobindo's and my teaching, — it is well understood, distance does not count here, you may be in France, you may be at the other end of the world or at Pondicherry, the tie is always true and living. And each time there comes a call, each time there is a need for me to know so that I may send out a force, an inspiration, protection or any other thing, a sort of message comes to me all of a sudden and I do the needful ... With those whom I have accepted as disciples, to whom I have said 'yes,' there is more than a tie, there is an emanation of me."</p>

<p><em>(January, 1928. The old Library room in the Ashram. An interview with the Mother. Having turned his back upon his old life, K.D. Sethna, afterwards renamed Amal Kiran by Sri Aurobindo, sits smartly dressed in European style, facing the Mother across a table.)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: Mother, I have seen the world thoroughly. No more of it. I am sick of intellectual pursuits as well. Now I want nothing except God.</p>
<p>MOTHER: You have seen the world thoroughly? How old are you?</p>
<p>SETHNA: Twenty-three.</p>
<p>MOTHER: Only twenty-three and ...</p>
<p>SETHNA: Yes, Mother. Can I stay here for good?</p>
<p>MOTHER: <em>(Compassionately)</em> Don't decide in a hurry. Stay here now and see how it suits you. Then ...</p>
<p><em>(The Mother rises)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: Wait a moment, Mother. Let me make my pranam to you. You know, we Indians make a pranam to our Guru.</p>
<p><em>(The Mother smiles. She does not mention that at least a hundred times each day the Ashramites make pranams to her.</em></p>
<p><em>Sethna prostrates before her. She blesses him. Later she relates to Sri Aurobindo how a young Parsi "taught" her the Indian way with one's Guru! Sri Aurobindo enjoys the joke.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some weeks later. Sea-side, Pondicherry. Sethna, meditating alone in the morning, on the pier. He was worrying in his mind about not having an opening in the heart or any extraordinary spiritual experience. He had been told that he might think of a book in the heart, opening. The mention of a book had put him out a little, for he was sick of the mental pursuits associated with books. In the course of his meditation now, he felt as if the sea were swaying right through his heart in a rhythm of wide delight.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Some time after February 21, 1928, when Sethna has his first Darshan of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. Sethna and the Mother.)</em></p>
<p>SETHNA: May I ask if Sri Aurobindo has said anything about me?</p>
<p>MOTHER: "He has a good face." That's what Sri Aurobindo has said.</p>
<p><em>(The remark strikes home. Sethna is all surprise. He at once remembers that he himself had fixedly scanned Sri Aurobindo's own face at the Darshan moments and found it "good"!</em></p>
<p><em>August 15, 1928. Sethna had his second Darshan, and offers to Sri Aurobindo a poem of his. He comes downstairs into Purani's room and sits still, head bent in dejection. He seemed to have lost the inner consciousness that had abided with him for a long time, almost starting from that moment at the sea-side. He had somehow faced Sri Aurobindo now with the outer mind again.)</em></p>
<p>PURANI: What's the matter?</p>
<p>SETHNA: I don't know.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly he feels as if a huge solid mass were pressing from above into his head, causing giddiness, bringing strange tears into the eyes and making the heart beat wildly with joy.</em></p>
<p><em>In the afternoon he comes to the Mother to receive a Blessing-garland from her. The Mother takes him into her interview-room.)</em></p>
<p>MOTHER: Do you know what Sri Aurobindo has said this time? There is great change in you, he has said, and he is very pleased.</p>
<p><em>(Sethna falls at the Mother's feet and takes her Blessing.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry. Time: 10 a.m. May 29, 1928. Sri Aurobindo and, at a distance, the Mother.</em></p>
<p><em>Sri Aurobindo had sent his secretary Nolini Kanta Gupta to receive Rabindranath Tagore on board the steamer when it was berthed at the pier, and escort him upstairs into the Darshan Room. The Poet came up the stairs and, throwing off his cap and shoes, rushed in, hands outstretched, at the sight of Sri Aurobindo standing at the other end of the room. Sri Aurobindo caught his hands and requested him to sit in a chair.</em></p>
<p><em>At this first look and touch, the Poet appeared overwhelmed and drawn back within himself.)</em></p>
<p>TAGORE: It is eighteen years since you left Bengal. All this time I have longed, off and on, to see you. My longing is fulfilled to-day. But I know it couldn't have been if you hadn't made a special concession for me. Hence, I am all the more grateful to you. As I have already written to you, I am now on my way to Europe. I ask: if they want to know of you, what shall I tell them?</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I, too, am glad to meet you. As for Europe, if they want to know of me, they are free to come here. My Ashram is open to sincere seekers from anywhere.</p>
<p>TAGORE: I wonder how you can run your Ashram and do your world-wide work from within your room in a corner of the earth. My wonder increases a hundred-fold when I think of my tremendous struggle and labour, in India and abroad, for the Viswabharati. Now I am out seeking help overseas.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: I am not troubled about the future. It's the Divine's work which the Divine does.</p>
<p><em>(Exit Rabindranath quite a different man. He had come all the way upstairs, talking with Nolini Kanta, complimenting him on his literary abilities, appreciating his originality and terseness of expression of thought and wishing him to turn to short stories: In a word, he was vivacious and "social". After the interview with Sri Aurobindo, he came down concentrated and silent. Returning to the steamer he shut himself up in a cabin and spent a long time alone. The Poet's classic reaction to the interview came out in the </em>Modern Review/ of Calcutta some time after.)/</p>

<p><em>(1940. An eminent Indian political leader and a well-known disciple of Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>LEADER: What does your Guru say about the outcome of the War?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: He says the Allies will win and he is doing his best to see that they win.</p>
<p>LEADER: The Allies despite their series of reverses and their ineptitude? And, even if they win, won't their victory reinforce and perpetuate their imperialism?</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: None knows the Allies, their ins and outs, more than Sri Aurobindo, and none has given the British Empire a greater shake-up than he.</p>
<p>LEADER: And yet he lends them his support? Indeed, it is a puzzle to me.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: No puzzle. He has given his crystal-clear and far-reaching reasons for his stand.</p>
<p>LEADER: Tell me, please.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: The Allies will stand for freedom and progress, whereas the axis-powers for world domination. And the axis-powers in the ascendant will throw the world back into serfdom. He has written, speaking for the Mother and himself:</p>
<p>"We feel that not only is this a battle waged in just self-defence and in defence of the nations threatened with the world-domination of Germany and the Nazi system of life, but that it is a defence of civilisation and its highest attained social, cultural and spiritual values and of the whole future of humanity. To this cause our support and sympathy will be unswerving whatever may happen; we look forward to the victory of Britain and, as the eventual result, an era of peace and union among the nations and a better and more secure world-order.</p>
<p>LEADER: Those who know Sri Aurobindo well may share his view but the multitude ...</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: <em>(Interrupting)</em> The Seer and the multitude ... When did they ever see eye to eye?</p>

<p><em>(On the eve of India's Independence, August 15, 1947. Sri Aurobindo's room. A disciple and Sri Aurobindo.)</em></p>
<p>DISCIPLE: to-morrow is your birthday and India's — India's rebirth in independence. A divine coincidence. The occasion has attracted an unusually large number of visitors for Darshan.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: It is no accident, to be sure.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: It is the victory of the struggle for independence you led under the captaincy of God, the fulfilment of the word He gave you in Alipore Jail. The Mother has had a flag-staff set up on the top of your room. To-morrow she is going to hoist the flag, because it is India's spiritual flag as well.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: You are right. But a divided India is a mixed blessing. It will entail on the Mother a continuing burden of problems till India has attained her integral solidarity.</p>
<p>DISCIPLE: I am sure, if that is God's Will the Mother will bear it with your help and guidance. No truth can rest divided for long.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: That's it. All divisions all over the world must go before it becomes one for the ONE. His Will will triumph over human folly.</p>

<p>A day may come when she must stand unhelped<br /> On a dangerous brink of the world's doom and hers.</p>
<p>In that tremendous silence lone and lost<br /> Cry not to heaven, for she alone can help.<br /> She only can save herself and save the world.</p>

<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Ah, it is finished? What is left now?</p>
<p>NIROD: The Book of Death and the Epilogue.</p>
<p>SRI AUROBINDO: Ah, that? We shall see about that later on.</p>

<p><em>(Outside the Ashram. A and B, two disciples of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, in a reminiscent mood.)</em></p>
<p>B: Mother's words have put heart into me. Oh, what a folly had overtaken me! Sri Aurobindo is above Life and Death — the one cannot bind Him, the other cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>A: That's what the Master Yogi is. And even more. His physical presence in the Ashram was never its confinement. With the whole earth for his sphere of action, he was wherever his presence was called for. Space and Time are for us humans, not for the Master of Supramental Yoga. Let us never forget what the Mother has said:</p>
<p>DECEMBER 9, 1950</p>
<p>TO THEE WHO HAST BEEN THE MATERIAL ENVELOPE OF OUR MASTER, TO THEE OUR INFINITE GRATITUDE. BEFORE THEE WHO HAST DONE SO MUCH FOR US, WHO HAST WORKED, STRUGGLED, SUFFERED, HOPED, ENDURED SO MUCH, BEFORE THEE WHO HAST WILLED ALL, ATTEMPTED ALL, PREPARED, ACHIEVED ALL FOR US, BEFORE THEE WE BOW DOWN AND IMPLORE THAT WE MAY NEVER FORGET EVEN FOR A MOMENT, ALL WE OWE TO THEE.</p>
<p><em>(The plates bearing these words of the Mother in English translation and in the French original are fixed on the two sides of the Samadhi, north and south. They attract an assembly of sadhaks, coming up, reading it and pausing beside it, file after file, in a meditative silence.)</em></p>
