    <title>Question: This is a question about God the Justice and God the Compassion. If a person has behaved in such a way over the years that God the Justice is now dealing with that person, instead of feeling shattered or scared or reacting in a negative way to God the Justice, is it possible to feel incredible, intense love for God the Justice? And by virtue of that love, can God the Justice turn into God the Compassion? If the person says, “No matter what You do, I love You, I love You,” then will God the Justice turn into God the Compassion? | Sri Chinmoy Library</title>

If the person says, “No matter what You do, I love You, I love You,” then will God the Justice turn into God the Compassion?" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>
 
<p><em>Sri Chinmoy:</em> God the Justice does not have to turn into God the Compassion, because that person is so open to God’s Light that he has become inseparably one with God. His love for God is so immense that when God kicks him, he feels that God is feeding him Nectar. He cannot separate God the Justice and God the Compassion at that time, for his love for God is so immense and intense. You may be a third person watching and saying, “O my God! God is punishing him.” But if your heart is inseparably one with God’s Heart, at that time you will see that that person has tremendous love for God.</p>
<p>It is like the famous story about Narada. Narada had been meditating for a few years, and then he asked Vishnu how many years it would take him to realise God. Vishnu said, “Only three more incarnations.” Narada said, “Three more incarnations? It is too much, too much!” He was ready to give up.</p>
<p>Then another fellow who was a drunkard asked Vishnu, “How many incarnations will it take for me to realise God?” Vishnu said, “As many incarnations as there are leaves on this tree.” The drunkard started dancing with joy! He said, “Oh, one day I shall be able to realise God! This is such a tiny tree. It has only very few leaves.” Look at his attitude! He was dancing with joy because he would one day be able to realise God. He did not see those countless leaves. Is it not unimaginable that he had to take so many incarnations? And Narada could not wait for even three incarnations!</p>
<p>Among the gods, the sage Bhrigu wanted to see who was the most compassionate. He went to Brahma and did not show Brahma respect. Brahma got furious. Then he went to Shiva and did not show respect, so Shiva got furious and wanted to turn him into ashes. Finally Brighu went to Vishnu, who was lying down, sleeping. He kicked Vishnu very smartly, and then stood on Vishnu’s feet. Instead of using his occult power to destroy Bhrigu, Vishnu grabbed his foot and said, “How are you, my child? Are you hurt? I am so sorry! You have struck me. Now are you hurt?” This is the Compassion aspect of the divine. When Bhrigu went to the others and showed disrespect, they got furious. But then Bhrigu went into Vishnu’s room, where Vishnu was sleeping. He kicked Vishnu very hard and then stood on his feet! From that time on, Vishnu kept the mark of Bhrigu’s feet.</p>
<p>It should be exactly the same when we feel God’s Justice. We say that God strikes us because we have done something wrong. But we should say, “No, it is for my good that He has struck me.” The moment we can feel that after so many years God has struck us for our own good, the moment we develop that kind of divine sense, we will not even call it God’s Justice. We will say, “O my God, You have come, You have come, You have come! Now do anything You like! Kick me or throw me out; whatever You want to do, just do it! Even if You want to kill me, You can kill me, because Your Happiness I want.” When a seeker becomes inseparably one with God’s Will, he will say, “Do whatever You like! If You want to kill me, kill me. I only want Your Happiness.”</p>
<p>So God’s Justice does not have to turn into God’s Compassion. Even while the seeker is being kicked, he can take it as God’s Compassion-Light. Whatever God is doing at God’s choice Hour with an individual is for the best. That is the best attitude. When a seeker has that attitude, it means that God has raised his consciousness to a very lofty height. He knows that anything God does is for his own good, and he feels that the only way he can please God at every moment is by having this kind of inseparable oneness with God. The seeker has gone far beyond the domain of Justice and Compassion at that time. He is in the domain of delight and ecstasy, for God has touched him. Just because God has taken the time to touch him, he is swimming in the sea of delight.</p>  <div id="book-navigation-1170868" class="book-navigation">
